My dear brothers, sisters, and\
friends throughout the world,\
0:06\
I offer my personal welcome\
to this general conference.\
0:11\
We gather as a\
great global family\
0:14\
desiring to worship our Lord\
and Savior, Jesus Christ.\
0:18\
Thank you for joining with us.\
0:22\
This last year has been\
one for the record books.\
0:26\
No doubt we have\
each learned things\
0:29\
we did not know previously.\
0:31\
Some lessons that\
I knew before have\
0:35\
been written on my heart in\
new and instructive ways.\
0:40\
For example, I know for\
sure that the Lord directs\
0:46\
the affairs of His Church.\
0:48\
He said, "I will show [you] ...\
that I am able to do mine own\
0:52\
work."\
0:54\
Often my counselors\
and I have watched\
0:56\
through tear-brimmed\
eyes as He has interceded\
1:02\
in extremely challenging\
circumstances\
1:05\
after we had done our\
best and could do no more.\
1:09\
We do indeed stand all amazed.\
1:16\
I also understand\
better now what\
1:18\
He meant when He\
said, "Behold, I\
1:21\
will hasten my\
work in its time."\
1:24\
Over and over again I have\
rejoiced as He has directed\
1:29\
and executed the hastening of\
His work--even during a global\
1:34\
pandemic.\
1:37\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
the strength of the Church\
1:40\
lies in the efforts and\
ever-growing testimonies\
1:45\
of its members.\
1:46\
Testimonies are best\
cultivated in the home.\
1:51\
During this past\
year, many of you\
1:55\
have dramatically\
increased the study\
1:57\
of the gospel in your homes.\
2:00\
I thank you, and your\
children will thank you.\
2:07\
The huge project to renovate\
the Salt Lake Temple continues.\
2:12\
From my office, I\
have a front-row seat\
2:15\
to watch the work taking\
place on the temple plaza.\
2:19\
As I have watched workers dig\
out old tree roots, plumbing,\
2:25\
wiring, and a leaky fountain,\
I have thought about the need\
2:31\
for each of us to remove,\
with the Savior's help,\
2:35\
the old debris in our lives.\
2:41\
The gospel of Jesus Christ\
is a gospel of repentance.\
2:45\
Because of the\
Savior's Atonement,\
2:48\
His gospel provides\
an invitation\
2:50\
to keep changing, growing,\
and becoming more pure.\
2:55\
It is a gospel of hope, of\
healing, and of progress.\
3:02\
Thus the gospel is\
a message of joy!\
3:06\
Our spirits rejoice with every\
small step forward we take.\
3:12\
Part of the gathering of\
Israel--and a very significant\
3:15\
part--is the charge for us as a\
people to be worthy and willing\
3:23\
to help prepare the world for\
the Second Coming of the Lord.\
3:28\
As we listen to\
the messages that\
3:31\
have been carefully\
prepared by our leaders\
3:34\
under the direction\
of the Holy Ghost,\
3:37\
I invite you to pray to\
identify the debris you\
3:43\
should remove from your life\
so you can become more worthy.\
3:51\
I love you, my dear\
brothers and sisters,\
3:55\
and testify that our Heavenly\
Father and His Beloved Son\
3:59\
know and love you individually.\
4:02\
They stand ready to assist you\
in every step forward you take.\
4:06\
Welcome to general conference\
and to the privilege\
4:10\
of hearing the\
voice of the Lord,\
4:12\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
