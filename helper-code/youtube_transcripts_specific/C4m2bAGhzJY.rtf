that was wonderful this has been a\
0:04\
unforgettable evening my dear sisters\
0:07\
i'm honored to be with you\
0:10\
you've been on my mind so often during\
0:13\
these past few months\
0:15\
you are more than eight million strong\
0:20\
you have not only the numbers but the\
0:22\
spiritual power to change the world\
0:26\
i have watched you during doing just\
0:28\
that\
0:29\
during this pandemic\
0:33\
some of you suddenly found yourself\
0:34\
searching for scarce supplies\
0:37\
or a new job many\
0:40\
tutored children and checked on\
0:42\
neighbors some\
0:44\
welcomed missionaries home earlier than\
0:46\
expected\
0:47\
while others transformed your homes into\
0:50\
missionary training centers\
0:54\
you have used technology to connect with\
0:56\
family and friends minister to those who\
0:58\
have felt isolated\
1:01\
and to study come follow me with others\
1:05\
you have found new ways to make the\
1:06\
sabbath a delight\
1:09\
and you have made protective masks\
1:12\
millions of them\
1:16\
with heartfelt compassion and love my\
1:18\
heart goes out\
1:19\
to the many women around the world whose\
1:21\
loved ones have died\
1:25\
we weep with you and we pray for you\
1:30\
we praise and pray for all\
1:33\
who work tirelessly to safeguard the\
1:36\
health of others\
1:40\
our few young women have also been\
1:42\
remarkable\
1:45\
those social media have been flooded\
1:47\
with contention\
1:49\
many of you have found ways to encourage\
1:52\
others and\
1:53\
share our savior's light\
1:56\
sisters you have all been absolutely\
2:00\
heroic\
2:01\
i marvel at your strength and your faith\
2:05\
you have shown that in difficult\
2:07\
circumstances you bravely carry on\
2:11\
i love you and i assure you that the\
2:14\
lord loves you and sees the great work\
2:16\
you are performing\
2:18\
thank you once again you have proven\
2:21\
that you\
2:22\
are literally the hope of israel\
2:27\
you embody the hopes that president\
2:29\
gordon b hinckley had\
2:30\
for you when he introduced the family a\
2:33\
proclamation to the world\
2:35\
25 years ago in september 1995\
2:39\
general relief society meeting\
2:42\
it is significant that he chose to\
2:44\
introduce this important proclamation\
2:46\
to the sisters of the church by doing so\
2:50\
president hinckley underscored the\
2:52\
irreplaceable influence of women\
2:54\
in the lord's plan\
2:59\
now i would love to know\
3:02\
what you have learned this year\
3:06\
have you grown closer to the lord\
3:09\
or do you feel further away from him\
3:14\
and how have current events made you\
3:17\
feel about the future\
3:21\
admittedly the lord has spoken of our\
3:23\
day in\
3:24\
sobering terms he warned that in our day\
3:28\
men's hearts would fail them and that\
3:31\
even the very elect would be at risk of\
3:34\
being deceived\
3:37\
he told the prophet joseph smith that\
3:39\
peace would be taken from the earth and\
3:41\
calamities would befall mankind yet\
3:45\
the lord has also provided a vision of\
3:48\
how remarkable this dispensation is\
3:52\
he inspired the prophet joseph smith to\
3:54\
declare that the work of these last days\
3:56\
is one of vast magnitude\
4:00\
its glories are past description and its\
4:03\
grandeur\
4:04\
unsurpassable close quote\
4:09\
now grandeur may not be the word you\
4:12\
would choose to describe these past few\
4:14\
months\
4:16\
how are we to deal with both the somber\
4:19\
prophecies\
4:21\
and the glorious pronouncements about\
4:24\
our day\
4:26\
the lord told us how with simple but\
4:30\
stunning reassurance\
4:33\
if ye are prepared ye shall\
4:37\
not fear what a promise\
4:42\
it is one that can literally change the\
4:44\
way we see our future\
4:48\
i recently heard a woman of deep\
4:50\
testimony admit\
4:52\
that the pandemic combined with an\
4:55\
earthquake\
4:56\
in the salt lake valley had helped her\
4:58\
realize she was not\
4:59\
as prepared as she thought she was\
5:02\
when i asked whether she was referring\
5:04\
to her food storage\
5:06\
or her testimony she smiled and said\
5:09\
yes\
5:15\
if preparation is our key to embracing\
5:18\
this dispensation\
5:20\
and our future with faith\
5:24\
how can we best prepare\
5:28\
for decades the lord's prophets have\
5:30\
urged us to store\
5:31\
food water and financial reserves for a\
5:34\
time of need\
5:35\
the current pandemic has reinforced the\
5:38\
wisdom of that council\
5:40\
i urge you to take steps to be\
5:42\
temporarily prepared\
5:45\
but i am even more concerned about your\
5:48\
spiritual\
5:49\
and emotional preparation\
5:53\
in that regard we can learn a lot from\
5:54\
captain moroni\
5:57\
as commander of the nephite armies he\
5:59\
faced opposing forces\
6:02\
that were stronger greater in number and\
6:05\
meaner\
6:07\
so merle and i prepared his people in\
6:10\
three essential ways\
6:13\
first he helped them create\
6:16\
areas where they would be safe places of\
6:20\
security he called them\
6:23\
second he prepared the minds of the\
6:26\
people to be faithful unto the lord\
6:30\
and third he never stopped\
6:34\
preparing his people physically or\
6:36\
spiritually\
6:39\
let's consider these three principles\
6:43\
principle number one create places of\
6:47\
security\
6:50\
moroni fortified every nephite city with\
6:53\
embankments\
6:54\
forts and walls when the lamanites came\
6:58\
against them they were astonished\
7:00\
exceedingly\
7:02\
because of the wisdom of the nephites in\
7:04\
preparing their places of security\
7:09\
similarly as turmoil rages around us\
7:14\
we need to create places where we are\
7:16\
safe\
7:18\
both physically and spiritually\
7:23\
when your home becomes a personal\
7:26\
sanctuary of faith\
7:28\
where the spirit resides your home\
7:31\
becomes the first line of defense\
7:36\
likewise the stakes of zion are a refuge\
7:39\
from the storm\
7:40\
because they are led by those who hold\
7:42\
priesthood keys and exercise priesthood\
7:45\
authority\
7:47\
as you continue to follow the counsel of\
7:50\
those whom the lord has authorized to\
7:52\
guide you\
7:54\
you will feel greater safety\
7:59\
the temple the house of the lord\
8:02\
is a place of security unlike any other\
8:07\
there you sisters are endowed with\
8:09\
priesthood power\
8:10\
through the sacred priesthood covenants\
8:12\
you make\
8:15\
there your families are sealed for\
8:17\
eternity\
8:20\
even this year when access to our\
8:21\
temples has been seriously limited\
8:24\
your endowment has given you constant\
8:27\
access to god's power\
8:30\
as you have honored your covenants with\
8:33\
him\
8:35\
simply said a place of security is\
8:38\
anywhere you can feel the presence of\
8:41\
the holy ghost\
8:43\
and be guided by him when the holy ghost\
8:46\
is with you you can teach\
8:48\
truth even when it runs counter to\
8:51\
prevailing opinions\
8:53\
and you can ponder sincere questions\
8:55\
about the gospel\
8:57\
in an environment of revelation\
9:01\
i invite you my dear sisters to create a\
9:04\
home as a place of security\
9:07\
and i renew my invitation for you to\
9:09\
increase your understanding of\
9:10\
priesthood power\
9:12\
and of temple covenants and blessings\
9:17\
having places of security to which you\
9:19\
can retreat will help you embrace the\
9:21\
future with faith\
9:25\
principle number two prepare your mind\
9:29\
to be faithful to god\
9:34\
we haven't undertaken a major project to\
9:37\
extend the life and capacity of the salt\
9:39\
lake temple\
9:41\
some questioned the need for taking such\
9:44\
extraordinary measures\
9:46\
however when the salt lake valley\
9:49\
suffered a 5.7 magnitude earthquake\
9:52\
earlier this year\
9:54\
this venerable temple shook hard enough\
9:57\
that the trumpet on the statue of the\
9:59\
angel mural knight fell\
10:04\
well just as the physical foundation of\
10:05\
the salt lake temple must be strong\
10:07\
enough to withstand\
10:08\
natural disasters our spiritual\
10:12\
foundations\
10:13\
must be solid\
10:16\
then when metaphorical earthquakes rock\
10:19\
our lives\
10:21\
we can stand steadfast and immovable\
10:25\
because of our faith\
10:29\
the lord taught us how to increase our\
10:30\
faith by seeking learning\
10:33\
even by study and also by faith\
10:36\
we strengthen our faith in jesus christ\
10:38\
as we strive to keep his commandments\
10:41\
and always remember him\
10:45\
further our faith increases every time\
10:47\
we exercise our faith in him\
10:50\
that is what learning by faith means\
10:54\
for example each time we have the faith\
10:58\
to be obedient to god's laws\
11:01\
even when popular opinions belittle us\
11:06\
or each time we resist entertainment or\
11:09\
ideologies that celebrate\
11:11\
covenant breaking we are exercising our\
11:14\
faith\
11:16\
which in turn increases our faith\
11:22\
further few things build faith more than\
11:25\
does\
11:26\
regular immersion in the book of mormon\
11:29\
no other book testifies of jesus christ\
11:32\
with such\
11:33\
power and clarity\
11:36\
its prophets as inspired by the lord saw\
11:39\
our day\
11:40\
and selected the doctrine and truths\
11:42\
that would help us most\
11:45\
the book of mormon is our latter-day\
11:48\
survival guide\
11:52\
of course our ultimate security comes as\
11:55\
we yoke ourselves\
11:56\
to heavenly father in jesus christ\
12:01\
life without god is a life filled with\
12:05\
fear\
12:07\
life with god is a life filled\
12:11\
with peace this is because spiritual\
12:15\
blessings come to the faithful\
12:18\
receiving personal revelation is one of\
12:20\
the greatest of those blessings\
12:24\
the lord has promised that if we will\
12:26\
ask we may receive\
12:28\
revelation upon revelation\
12:31\
i promise that as you increase your\
12:33\
capacity to receive revelation\
12:36\
the lord will bless you with increased\
12:38\
direction for your life\
12:40\
and with boundless gifts of the spirit\
12:47\
principle number three never stop\
12:50\
preparing\
12:53\
even when things went well captain merle\
12:56\
and i\
12:56\
continued to prepare his people he never\
13:00\
stopped he never became complacent\
13:05\
the adversary never stops attacking\
13:09\
so we can never stop preparing\
13:13\
the more self-reliant we are temporarily\
13:17\
emotionally and the more prepared we are\
13:21\
to thwart\
13:22\
satan's relentless assaults\
13:28\
dear sisters you are adept at creating\
13:32\
places of security for yourselves and\
13:34\
those you love further you have a divine\
13:38\
endowment\
13:39\
that enables you to build faith in\
13:41\
others in compelling ways\
13:44\
and you never stop\
13:47\
you have demonstrated that once again\
13:49\
this year\
13:50\
please keep going\
13:54\
your vigilance in safeguarding your\
13:56\
homes and instilling\
13:57\
faith in the hearts of your loved ones\
14:00\
will reap\
14:00\
rewards for generations to come\
14:06\
my dear sisters we have so much to look\
14:08\
forward to\
14:10\
the lord placed you here now because he\
14:13\
knew you had the capacity\
14:15\
to to negotiate the complexities of the\
14:18\
latter part of these\
14:20\
latter days he knew you would grasp the\
14:23\
grandeur of his work and be eager to\
14:25\
help\
14:26\
bring it to pass\
14:30\
i'm not saying that the days ahead will\
14:32\
be easy\
14:34\
but i promise you that the future will\
14:37\
be glorious\
14:38\
for those who are prepared and who\
14:41\
contribute to\
14:42\
continue to prepare to be instruments\
14:45\
in the lord's hands\
14:49\
my dear sisters let us not just\
14:53\
endure this current season\
14:57\
let us embrace the future with faith\
15:01\
turbulent times are opportunities for us\
15:04\
to thrive\
15:05\
spiritually\
15:08\
there are times when our influence can\
15:11\
be much more\
15:12\
penetrating than in calmer times\
15:17\
i promise that as we create places of\
15:20\
security\
15:21\
prepare our minds to be faithful to god\
15:25\
and never stop preparing god\
15:28\
will bless us he will deliver us\
15:32\
yea in so much that he will speak peace\
15:34\
to our souls\
15:36\
and will grant unto us great faith\
15:40\
and cause us that we can hope\
15:44\
for our deliverance in him\
15:49\
as you prepare to embrace the future\
15:51\
with faith\
15:53\
these promises will be yours\
15:56\
i so testify with my expression of love\
16:00\
for you and my confidence in you\
16:05\
in the sacred name of jesus christ amen\
16:24\
you\
