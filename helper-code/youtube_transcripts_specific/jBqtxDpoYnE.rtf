Thank you, President Nelson.\
0:04\
We love and sustain you.\
0:05\
Thank you for that marvelous\
introduction to this conference.\
0:12\
The scriptures speak of a rich\
young ruler who ran to\
0:16\
Jesus, knelt at his feet, and with\
genuine sincerity asked\
0:22\
the Master, "What shall I do that\
I may inherit eternal life?"\
0:28\
After reviewing a long list of\
commandments, this fellow had\
0:31\
faithfully kept, Jesus told the\
man to sell all his\
0:35\
belongings, give the proceedings\
to the poor, take up His\
0:40\
cross, and follow Him.\
0:43\
The boldness of this directive\
caused the young ruler, in spite\
0:48\
of his expensive sandals, to get\
cold feet.\
0:52\
And he went away sorrowing\
because, the scripture\
0:56\
says, he had great possessions.\
1:01\
Obviously, this is an important\
cautionary tale about the uses of\
1:05\
wealth and the needs of the poor,\
but ultimately it is\
1:10\
a story about wholehearted,\
unreserved devotion\
1:15\
to divine responsibility.\
1:18\
With or without riches, each of us\
is to come to Christ with\
1:24\
the same uncompromised commitment\
to His gospel that was expected\
1:30\
of this young man.\
1:32\
In the vernacular of today's\
youth, we are to declare\
1:35\
ourselves "all in." In his\
characteristically memorable\
1:41\
prose, C.S.\
1:43\
Lewis imagines the Lord saying to\
us something like this.\
1:48\
"I don't want your time or your\
money or your work as much as\
1:53\
I just want you.\
1:56\
That tree you were pruning- I\
don't want to cut off a branch\
1:59\
here and a branch there.\
2:01\
I want the whole thing down.\
2:04\
And that tooth, I don't want to\
drill it or crown it or fill it.\
2:09\
I want to have it out.\
2:11\
In fact, I want to hand you over-\
I want you to hand over to\
2:15\
me, your whole natural self.\
2:19\
And I'll give you a new self\
instead.\
2:22\
In fact, I'll give you myself, my\
will\
2:27\
shall become your will."\
2:31\
Well, all who speak in this\
general conference will be\
2:36\
saying, one way or another, what\
Christ said to this\
2:40\
rich young man.\
2:42\
"Come unto your Savior, come\
completely and wholeheartedly.\
2:49\
Take up your cross, however heavy\
it may be, and follow Him." They\
2:56\
will say this, knowing that in the\
Kingdom of God, there can be\
3:00\
no halfway measures, no starting\
and stopping, no turning back.\
3:07\
To those who requested permission\
to bury a deceased\
3:10\
parent, or to at least say goodbye\
to other family\
3:13\
members, Jesus's reply was\
demanding and unequivocal.\
3:19\
"Leave that to others," he said.\
3:22\
"No man, having put his hand to\
the plow and looking\
3:25\
back, is fit for the kingdom of\
God." When difficult things are\
3:31\
asked of us, even things contrary\
to the longings of our\
3:36\
heart, remember that loyalty we\
pledge to the cause of Christ is\
3:44\
to be the supreme devotion of our\
lives.\
3:48\
Although Isaiah reassures us it is\
available "without\
3:52\
money, and without price," and it\
is, we must be\
3:57\
prepared, using Elliot's line, to\
have it cost, "not less\
4:04\
than everything."\
4:07\
Of course, we all have some habits\
or flaws or personal\
4:11\
history that could keep us from\
complete spiritual immersion in\
4:16\
this work.\
4:17\
But God is our father.\
4:20\
And is exceptionally good at\
forgiving and forgetting sins we\
4:25\
have forsaken- perhaps because we\
give Him so much\
4:30\
practice in doing so.\
4:32\
In any case, there is divine help\
for every one of us at any hour\
4:38\
that we feel to make a change in\
our behavior.\
4:43\
God gave Saul another heart.\
4:47\
Ezekiel called on all of ancient\
Israel to "cast off her past\
4:52\
and make a new heart and a new\
spirit." Alma called for\
4:57\
a "mighty change" that would cause\
the soul to expand.\
5:03\
And Jesus Himself taught that\
"except a man be born\
5:06\
again, he cannot see the Kingdom\
of God." Clearly,\
5:12\
the possibility of change and\
living at a more elevated\
5:16\
level has always been one of the\
gifts of God to those who\
5:21\
seek it.\
5:24\
Friends, in our present moment, we\
find all manner of\
5:29\
divisions and subdivisions, sets\
and\
5:32\
subsets, digital tribes and\
political identities, with\
5:37\
more than enough hostility to go\
around.\
5:41\
Might we ask ourselves if "a\
higher and holier life," to use\
5:47\
President Nelson's phrase, is\
something we could seek?\
5:52\
When doing so, we would do well to\
remember that stunning period\
5:57\
in the Book of Mormon in which\
those people asked and answered\
6:03\
that question so affirmatively.\
6:06\
I quote: "And it came to pass that\
there was no contention\
6:12\
among all the people in all the\
land because of the love of\
6:17\
God, which did dwell in the hearts\
of the people.\
6:23\
And there were no envyings, nor\
strifes, nor any\
6:27\
manner of lasciviousness, and\
surely there could not be\
6:31\
happier people among all the\
people who had been created\
6:36\
by the hand of God.\
6:38\
There were no robbers, nor\
murderers, neither were their\
6:43\
Lamanites, nor any manner of\
-ites, but they were in\
6:48\
one, the children of Christ, and\
heirs of the kingdom\
6:53\
of God.\
6:55\
And how blessed were they!" Close\
quote.\
7:03\
What is the key to this\
breakthrough in\
7:07\
contented, happy living?\
7:10\
It is embedded there in the text,\
in one\
7:14\
sentence: "the love of God did\
dwell in the hearts of\
7:21\
the people."\
7:24\
Now, when the love of God sets the\
tone for our own\
7:28\
lives, our own relationships to\
each other, and ultimately\
7:33\
for our feeling for all mankind,\
then all\
7:37\
distinctions, limiting labels and\
artificial divisions begin to\
7:44\
pass away and peace increases.\
7:49\
That is precisely what happened in\
our Book of Mormon example.\
7:55\
No longer were there Laminates or\
Jacobites or Josephites\
7:59\
or Zoramites.\
8:01\
There were no "-ites" at all.\
8:05\
The people had taken on just one\
transcendent identity.\
8:12\
They were all, it says, to be\
known as the\
8:18\
"children of Christ."\
8:21\
Of course, we're speaking here of\
the first great commandment given\
8:26\
to the human family: to love God\
wholeheartedly, without\
8:31\
reservation or compromise, that\
is, with all our\
8:35\
heart, might, mind, and strength.\
8:39\
This love of God is the first\
great commandment in\
8:44\
the universe.\
8:46\
But the first great truth in the\
universe is that God loves us\
8:52\
exactly that way now.\
8:55\
Wholeheartedly, without\
reservation or\
8:58\
compromise, with all of His heart,\
might, mind,\
9:04\
and strength.\
9:06\
And when those majestic forces,\
from His heart and\
9:10\
ours, meet without restraint,\
there is a veritable\
9:16\
explosion of spiritual moral\
power.\
9:21\
Then, as Teilhard de Chardin\
wrote, "For the second time in\
9:27\
the history of the world, Man will\
have discovered fire."\
9:34\
It is then, and really only then,\
that we can effectively\
9:39\
keep the second great commandment\
in ways that are not superficial\
9:44\
or trivial.\
9:46\
If we love God enough to try to be\
fully faithful to Him, He will\
9:52\
give us the ability, the capacity,\
the will, and\
9:57\
the way to love our neighbor and\
ourselves.\
10:03\
Perhaps then we will be able to\
say once again,\
10:09\
"there could not be\
10:14\
a happier people\
10:17\
among all the people who have been\
created by the hand of God."\
10:25\
Brothers and sisters, I pray we\
will succeed where that rich\
10:31\
young man failed.\
10:34\
That we will take up the Cross of\
Christ, however demanding it may\
10:40\
be, regardless of the issue, and\
regardless of\
10:44\
the cost.\
10:47\
I bear witness that when we pledge\
to follow Him, the path\
10:53\
will, one way or another, pass by\
way of a crown of thorns and\
11:01\
a stark Roman cross.\
11:05\
No matter how wealthy our young\
ruler was, he wasn't wealthy\
11:09\
enough to buy his way out of a\
rendezvous with those symbols.\
11:17\
And neither can we.\
11:20\
For the blessing of receiving the\
greatest of all\
11:23\
possessions, the gift of eternal\
life, it is little enough that we\
11:30\
are asked to stay the course\
11:34\
in following the High Priest of\
our profession, our Day\
11:38\
Star, Advocate, and King.\
11:43\
I testify with obscure Malachi of\
old, that each of us is to offer\
11:50\
our whole souls as an offering\
unto Him.\
11:57\
Of such determined, steadfast\
devotion we sing, "Praise\
12:04\
the Mount, I'm fixed upon it.\
12:10\
Mount of Thy redeeming love.\
12:14\
Here's my heart, oh take and seal\
it.\
12:19\
See it for the courts above." In\
the sacred name of Jesus\
12:26\
Christ, amen.\
