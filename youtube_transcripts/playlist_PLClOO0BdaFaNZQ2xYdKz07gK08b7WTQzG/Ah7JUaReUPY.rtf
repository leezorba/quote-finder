1:36\
of darkness shall cover the earth\

and the heavens shall shake and also the\
1:41\
earth\
1:42\
and great tribulations shall be among\

the children of men\
1:46\
but my people will i preserve\
1:50\
and righteousness will i send down out\
1:53\

3:09\
thousand years\

3:15\
you sisters your daughters your\
3:18\
granddaughters\
3:19\
and the women you have nurtured will be\
3:22\
at the heart\
3:23\
of creating that society of people\
3:27\
who will join in glorious association\
3:30\
with the savior you will be an essential\
3:34\
force in the gathering of israel\
3:37\
and in the creation of a zion people\
3:40\
who will dwell in peace in the new\
3:42\
jerusalem\
3:44\
the lord has through his prophets\
3:47\
made a promise to you in the early days\
3:50\
of the holy society\
3:52\
the prophet joseph smith said to the\
3:54\
sisters\
3:55\
open quote if you live up to your\
3:58\
privileges\
3:59\
the angels cannot be restrained\
4:02\
from being your associates close quote\
4:06\
that marvelous potential lies within you\
4:10\
and you are being prepared for it\
4:13\
president gordon b hinckley said open\
4:15\
quote\
4:16\
you sisters do not hold a second place\
4:19\
in our father's plan for the eternal\
4:21\
happiness\
4:22\
and well-being of his children you are\
4:25\
an absolutely essential part of that\
4:28\
plan\
4:29\
without you the plan could not function\
4:33\
without you the entire program would be\
4:36\
frustrated\
4:38\
each of you is a daughter of god endowed\
4:41\
with a divine birthright close quote\
4:44\
our current prophet president russell m\
4:46\
nelson has given this descript\
4:49\
description of the part you play in\
4:52\
preparation\
4:53\
for the savior's coming open quote\
4:56\
it would be impossible to measure the\
4:58\
influence that women have\
5:01\
not only on families but also on the\
5:03\
lord's\
5:04\
church as wives mothers and grandmothers\
5:08\
as sisters and aunts as teachers and\
5:11\
leaders\
5:12\
and especially as exemplars\
5:15\
and devout defenders of the faith\
5:18\
this has been true in every dispensation\
5:22\
since the days of adam and eve\
5:25\
yet the women of this dispensation are\
5:28\
distinct\
5:29\
from the women of any other because this\
5:33\
dispensation is distinct from any other\
5:37\
this distinction brings both privileges\
5:40\
and responsibilities close quote\
5:43\
this dispensation is distinct\
5:47\
in that the lord will lead us to become\
5:50\
prepared to be like the city of enoch\
5:55\
he has described through his apostles\
5:57\
and prophets\
5:58\
what that transformation to a zion\
6:01\
people will entail\
6:04\
elder bruce r mcconkie said it so well\
6:07\
open quote\
6:09\
enochs was a day of wickedness and evil\
6:12\
a day of darkness and rebellion a day of\
6:15\
war\
6:15\
and desolation a day leading up to the\
6:18\
cleansing of the earth by\
6:20\
water enoch however was faithful\
6:23\
he saw the lord and talked with him face\
6:26\
to face\
6:27\
as one man speaks with another the lord\
6:30\
sent him to cry repentance to the world\
6:34\
and commissioned him to baptize in the\
6:36\
name of the father and of the son\
6:38\
which is full of grace and truth and of\
6:41\
the holy ghost\
6:42\
which beareth record of the father and\
6:45\
the son\
6:47\
enoch made covenants and assembled a\
6:49\
congregation\
6:50\
of true believers all of whom became\
6:54\
so faithful that the lord came and dwelt\
6:57\
with his people\
6:58\
and they dwelt in righteousness and were\
7:00\
blessed from on high\
7:02\
and the lord called his people zion\
7:04\
because they were of one heart\
7:06\
and one mind and dwelt in righteousness\
7:10\
and there was no poor among them after\
7:12\
the lord called his people\
7:14\
zion the scripture says that enoch built\
7:16\
a city that was called the city of\
7:18\
holiness\
7:19\
even zion and that zion was taken up\
7:23\
into heaven where god received it into\
7:25\
his own bosom\
7:26\
and that from fence went forth to saying\
7:29\
zion\
7:30\
is fled this same zion\
7:33\
which was taken up into heaven shall\
7:35\
return\
7:36\
when the lord brings against zion and\
7:39\
its inhabitants shall join with the new\
7:41\
jerusalem\
7:42\
which shall then be established close\
7:44\
quote\
7:46\
now if the past is prologue at the time\
7:50\
of the savior's coming\
7:52\
the daughters who are deeply committed\
7:54\
to their covenants with god\
7:57\
will be more than half of those who are\
7:59\
prepared to welcome him\
8:01\
when he comes but whatever the numbers\
8:04\
your contribution in creating unity\
8:08\
among the people prepared for that zion\
8:11\
will be far greater than half i will\
8:14\
tell you why i believe that will be so\
8:17\
the book of mormon gives an account of a\
8:19\
zion people you remember\
8:21\
that it was after they had been taught\
8:22\
loved and blessed by the resurrected\
8:25\
savior\
8:27\
there was no contention in the land\
8:29\
because of the love of god\
8:30\
which did dwell in the hearts of the\
8:32\
people\
8:35\
my experience has taught me that\
8:38\
heavenly father's daughters have a\
8:40\
gift to allay contention\
8:43\
and to promote righteousness with their\
8:46\
love of god\
8:48\
and with the love of god they engender\
8:50\
in those they serve\
8:53\
i saw it in my youth when our tiny\
8:55\
branch\
8:56\
met in my childhood home a very small\
8:58\
home\
8:59\
my brother and i were the only aaronic\
9:03\
priesthood holders and my father the\
9:06\
only melchizedek priesthood holder in\
9:08\
the branch\
9:09\
the branch relief society president was\
9:12\
a convert whose husband was unhappy with\
9:14\
our church service\
9:15\
the members were all older sisters\
9:17\
without a priesthood holder in their\
9:19\
homes\
9:20\
i watched my mother and those sisters\
9:23\
love lift and care for each other\
9:26\
unfailingly i realize now\
9:30\
that i was given an early glimpse of\
9:32\
zion\
9:34\
my tutorial in the influence of faithful\
9:36\
women\
9:38\
continued in a small branch of the\
9:39\
church in albuquerque new mexico\
9:42\
i watched the branch president's wife\
9:45\
the district president's wife and the\
9:46\
re-society president warm the heart of\
9:49\
every newcomer and convert\
9:53\
two years after i arrived the sunday i\
9:55\
left albuquerque\
9:57\
after observing the influence of sisters\
10:00\
there\
10:01\
the first stake was created and the lord\
10:04\
has placed\
10:05\
a temple there i moved next to boston\
10:09\
where i served in the district\
10:10\
presidency that presided over little\
10:13\
branches spread across\
10:14\
two states there were contentions\
10:18\
that more than once were resolved by\
10:20\
loving\
10:21\
and forgiving women who helped soften\
10:23\
hearts\
10:25\
the sunday i left boston a memory of the\
10:27\
first presidency organized the first\
10:29\
stake in massachusetts there is a temple\
10:32\

10:33\

10:39\
church activity\
10:41\
and was later called to serve as a state\
10:43\
president and then a mission president\
10:46\
all influenced by a faithful and loving\
10:49\

11:05\
others and to lift them higher toward\
11:08\
the love and purity\
11:10\
that will qualify him to live together\
11:13\
in a zion society it is not\
11:16\
accident that the relief society\
11:19\
the first church organization\
11:22\
specifically for heavenly father's\
11:24\
daughters\
11:24\
has its motto charity\
11:28\
never faileth charity is the pure love\
11:31\
of christ\
11:33\
and it is faith in him and the full\
11:35\
effects of his\
11:36\
infinite atonement that will qualify you\
11:40\

11:47\
