good morning brothers and sisters\
0:04\
as a disciple of our savior jesus christ\
0:07\
i have been looking forward to gathering\
0:10\
virtually\
0:11\
from all corners of the world for this\
0:13\
conference\
0:15\
this has been a most unusual year\
0:19\
for me it began with an assignment from\
0:21\
the first presidency\
0:23\
to dedicate a holy temple to the lord in\
0:26\
durban\
0:26\
south africa i will never forget the\
0:29\
grandeur of the building\
0:31\
but more than the setting i will always\
0:34\
treasure the dignity of the people\
0:36\
who were so well prepared to enter that\
0:39\
sacred edifice\
0:42\
they came ready to partake of one of the\
0:45\
crowning blessings of the restoration\
0:48\
the dedication of a house of the lord\
0:51\
they came with hearts filled with love\
0:53\
for him\
0:54\
and his atonement they came filled with\
0:57\
thanks\
0:58\
to our father in heaven for providing\
1:00\
sacred ordinances\
1:02\
that would lead them to exaltation they\
1:05\
came worthy\
1:07\
temples no matter where they are rise\
1:10\
above the ways of the world\
1:13\
every latter-day saint temple in the\
1:15\
world all 168 of them\
1:18\
stand as testaments to our faith\
1:22\
in eternal life and the joy of spending\
1:25\
it\
1:25\
with our families and our heavenly\
1:27\
father\
1:29\
attending the temple increases our\
1:31\
understanding of the godhead\
1:33\
and the everlasting gospel and\
1:36\
commitment\
1:37\
to live and teach truth and our\
1:40\
willingness to follow the example\
1:42\
of our lord and savior jesus christ\
1:45\
on the outside of every temple in the\
1:47\
church are the fitting words\
1:50\
holiness to the lord the temple is the\
1:53\
lord's house\
1:54\
and a sanctuary from the world his\
1:57\
spirit\
1:58\
envelops those who worship within those\
2:01\
sacred walls\
2:03\
he sets the standards by which we enter\
2:06\
as his guests\
2:08\
my father-in-law blaine twitchell\
2:12\
one of the best men i have ever known\
2:14\
taught me a great lesson\
2:17\
sister rasband and i went to visit him\
2:19\
when he was nearing the end of his\
2:21\
mortal journey\
2:23\
as we entered his room his bishop was\
2:25\
just leaving\
2:27\
as we greeted the bishop i thought what\
2:30\
a nice bishop\
2:31\
he's here doing his ministering to a\
2:34\
faithful member of his ward\
2:37\
i mentioned to blaine wasn't that nice\
2:40\
of the bishop to come visit\
2:42\
and blaine looked at me and responded\
2:45\
it was far more than that i asked for\
2:48\
the bishop to come\
2:50\
because i wanted my temple recommend\
2:52\
interview\
2:53\
i want to go recommended to the lord\
2:58\
and he did that phrase\
3:01\
recommended to the lord has stayed with\
3:04\
me\
3:05\
it has put a whole new perspective on\
3:08\
being interviewed regularly\
3:10\
by our church leaders so important is a\
3:13\
temple recommend\
3:15\
that in the early church until 1891\
3:19\
each temple recommend was endorsed by\
3:22\
the president of the church\
3:25\
whether for youth or adults your temple\
3:28\
recommend interview\
3:30\
is not about do's and don'ts a recommend\
3:33\
is not a checklist\
3:35\
a hall pass or a ticket for special\
3:38\
seating\
3:39\
it has a much higher and holier purpose\
3:43\
to qualify for the honor of a temple\
3:46\
recommend\
3:47\
you must live in harmony with the\
3:49\
teachings of the church of jesus christ\
3:51\
of latter-day saints\
3:54\
in your interview you have the\
3:56\
opportunity to search your soul\
3:58\
about your personal faith in jesus\
4:01\
christ and his atonement\
4:03\
you have the blessing to express your\
4:05\
testimony\
4:06\
of the restored gospel the willingness\
4:09\
to sustain those whom the lord has\
4:11\
called\
4:12\
to lead his church your faith in the\
4:16\
doctrine of the gospel\
4:17\
your fulfillment of family\
4:19\
responsibilities\
4:21\
your qualities of honesty chastity\
4:23\
fidelity\
4:24\
obedience observance of the word of\
4:27\
wisdom\
4:28\
beloved tithing and the sanctity of the\
4:31\
sabbath day\
4:33\
those are bedrock principles of a life\
4:36\
devoted to jesus christ\
4:38\
and his work your temple recommend\
4:41\
reflects a deep\
4:43\
spiritual intent that you are striving\
4:45\
to live the laws of the lord\
4:47\
and love what he loves humility\
4:50\
meekness steadfastness charity\
4:54\
courage compassion forgiveness\
4:57\
and obedience and you commit yourself to\
5:01\
those standards\
5:03\
when you sign your name to that sacred\
5:06\
document\
5:08\
your temple recommend opens the gates of\
5:10\
heaven for you\
5:12\
and others with rights and ordinances\
5:15\
of eternal significance including\
5:18\
baptisms endowments marriages\
5:22\
and ceilings to be recommended to the\
5:25\
lord\
5:26\
is to be reminded of what is expected of\
5:29\
a covenant-keeping latter-day saint\
5:33\
my father-in-law blaine twitchell saw it\
5:36\
as invaluable preparation\
5:38\
for the day when he would humbly stand\
5:40\
before the lord\
5:43\
consider when moses climbed mount horeb\
5:46\
and the lord jehovah appeared to him in\
5:48\
a burning bush\
5:49\
god told him put off thy shoes from off\
5:53\
thy feet\
5:54\
for the place whereon thou standest is\
5:57\
holy ground\
6:00\
putting off our shoes at the door of the\
6:02\
temple is letting go of worldly desires\
6:05\
or pleasures that distract us from\
6:08\
spiritual growth\
6:09\
setting aside those things which\
6:12\
sidetrack\
6:13\
our precious mortality rising above\
6:16\
contentious behavior and seeking time\
6:20\
to be holy by divine design\
6:24\
our physical body is a creation of god\
6:28\
a temple for your spirit and should be\
6:31\
treated with reverence\
6:33\
so true are the words of the primary\
6:36\
song\
6:37\
my body is a temple which needs the\
6:40\
greatest\
6:41\
care when the lord appeared to the\
6:44\
nephites he commanded\
6:46\
be sanctified by the reception of the\
6:48\
holy ghost\
6:50\
that ye may stand spotless before me\
6:54\
what manner of men ought ye to be asked\
6:56\
the lord\
6:57\
and then answered even as i am\
7:01\
to be recommended to the lord we strive\
7:04\
to be like him i remember hearing\
7:08\
president howard w\
7:09\
hunter in his first address as the 14th\
7:12\
president\
7:13\
of the church he said it is the deepest\
7:16\
desire of my heart\
7:18\
to have every member of the church\
7:20\
worthy to enter the temple\
7:23\
it would please the lord if every adult\
7:25\
member\
7:26\
would be worthy of and carry a current\
7:29\
temple recommend\
7:31\
i would add that a limited use recommend\
7:34\
will set a clear path for our precious\
7:38\
youth president nelson recalled\
7:41\
president hunter's words quote on that\
7:44\
day\
7:45\
june 6 1994 the temple recommend that we\
7:49\
carry\
7:49\
became a different object in my wallet\
7:53\
before that it was a means to an end\
7:56\
it was the means to allow me to enter a\
7:58\
sacred house of the lord\
8:01\
but after he made that declaration that\
8:04\
became an end in itself\
8:07\
it became my badge of obedience to a\
8:10\
prophet of god\
8:12\
end quote if you have yet to receive a\
8:16\
recommend or if your recommend has\
8:18\
lapsed\
8:19\
line up at the door of the bishop just\
8:21\
as the early saints lined up at the door\
8:24\
of the nauvoo temple\
8:25\
in 1846 my ancestors were among those\
8:29\
faithful\
8:30\
they were abandoning their beautiful\
8:32\
city and going west\
8:35\
but they knew that there were sacred\
8:36\
experiences\
8:38\
awaiting them in the temple wrote sarah\
8:41\
rich from the rugged trail in iowa\
8:44\
if it had not been for the faith and\
8:46\
knowledge that was bestowed upon us\
8:48\
in that temple our journey would have\
8:51\
been like taking a leap\
8:53\
in the dark that is what we are missing\
8:57\
if we are going through this life alone\
8:59\
without the inspiration\
9:01\
and peace promised in the temple\
9:05\
begin the process now to become\
9:08\
recommended to the lord\
9:10\
that his spirit will be with you in\
9:12\
abundance\
9:13\
and his standards will bring you peace\
9:16\
of conscience\
9:18\
your youth leaders elders quorum\
9:20\
president relief society president\
9:22\
and ministering brothers and sisters\
9:25\
will help you prepare\
9:27\
and your bishop or branch president\
9:29\
lovingly\
9:30\
will guide you we have been experiencing\
9:34\
a time when temples have been\
9:36\
closed or limited in use\
9:39\
for president nelson and those of us who\
9:41\
serve at his side\
9:43\
the inspired decision to close the\
9:45\
temples was painful\
9:47\
and racked with worry president nelson\
9:50\
found himself\
9:51\
asking what would i say to the prophet\
9:54\
joseph smith\
9:55\
what would i say to brigham young\
9:57\
wilford wilford woodruff\
10:00\
and the other presidents on up to\
10:02\
president\
10:03\
thomas s monson now\
10:06\
we gradually and gratefully are\
10:09\
reopening temples for\
10:10\
ceilings and endowments on a limited\
10:13\
scale\
10:15\
being worthy to attend the temple\
10:18\
however\
10:19\
has not been suspended\
10:23\
let me emphasize whether you have access\
10:26\
to a temple or not\
10:28\
you need a current temple recommend to\
10:31\
stay\
10:31\
firmly on the covenant path\
10:35\
late last year sister rasband and i were\
10:37\
on assignment\
10:39\
in new zealand speaking with a large\
10:41\
group of young single adults\
10:44\
they had no easy access to a temple\
10:47\
the one in hamilton was being renovated\
10:49\
and they were still awaiting the\
10:51\
groundbreaking\
10:52\
for the temple in auckland however\
10:55\
i felt prompted to encourage them to\
10:58\
renew\
10:59\
or receive temple recommends\
11:02\
even though they could not present them\
11:05\
at the temple\
11:06\
they would presenting themselves before\
11:08\
the lord\
11:10\
pure and prepared to serve him\
11:14\
being worthy to hold a current temple\
11:16\
recommend is both a protection from the\
11:18\
adversary because you have made a firm\
11:21\
commitment to the lord about your life\
11:24\
and a promise that the spirit will be\
11:27\
with you\
11:29\
we do temple work when we search for our\
11:31\
ancestors\
11:32\
and submit their names for ordinances\
11:35\
while our temples have been closed we\
11:38\
have still been able to research our\
11:40\
families\
11:42\
with the spirit of the lord in our\
11:44\
hearts\
11:45\
we are by proxy standing in for\
11:48\
them to be recommended to the lord\
11:52\
when i was serving as the executive\
11:54\
director of the temple department\
11:56\
i heard president gordon b hinckley\
11:58\
refer to this scripture\
11:59\
spoken by the lord about the nauvoo\
12:02\
temple\
12:03\
let the work of my temple and all the\
12:06\
works which i have appointed unto you\
12:08\
be continued on and not cease and let\
12:11\
your diligence\
12:12\
and your perseverance and patience and\
12:15\
your works be\
12:17\
redoubled and you shall in no wise lose\
12:20\
your reward\
12:21\
saith the lord of hosts our work in the\
12:25\
temple is tied to our eternal reward\
12:28\
recently we have been put to the test\
12:31\
the lord has called us to work in the\
12:33\
temples\
12:34\
with diligence perseverance and patience\
12:38\
being recommended to the lord requires\
12:40\
those qualities\
12:42\
we must be diligent in living the\
12:44\
commandments\
12:45\
persevere in our attention to our temple\
12:48\
covenants\
12:48\
and be grateful for what the lord\
12:50\
continues to teach about them\
12:53\
and be patient as we wait for temples\
12:56\
to reopen in their fullness\
13:00\
when the lord calls for us to redouble\
13:02\
our efforts\
13:03\
he is asking that we increase in\
13:05\
righteousness\
13:07\
for example we may expand our study of\
13:10\
the scriptures\
13:11\
our family history research and our\
13:13\
prayers of faith\
13:15\
that we may share our love for the\
13:17\
lord's house\
13:19\
with those preparing to receive a temple\
13:22\
recommend\
13:23\
our family members in particular\
13:28\
i promise you as an apostle of the lord\
13:31\
jesus christ\
13:32\
that as you strive to redouble your\
13:35\
righteous efforts\
13:37\
you will feel renewed in your devotion\
13:39\
to god the father\
13:41\
and jesus christ you will feel an\
13:43\
abundance\
13:45\
of the holy ghost guiding you you will\
13:47\
be grateful\
13:49\
for your sacred covenants and\
13:52\
you will feel peace knowing you are\
13:55\
recommended\
13:57\
to the lord in the name of jesus christ\
14:00\
amen\
14:16\
you\
