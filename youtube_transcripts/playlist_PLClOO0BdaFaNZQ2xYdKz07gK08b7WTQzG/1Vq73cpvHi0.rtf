in reviewing the teachings of our dear\
0:03\
prophet\
0:04\
president russell m nelson i found a\
0:07\
word that he has frequently used in many\
0:10\
talks\
0:11\
this word is power in the first general\
0:14\
conference after he was sustained as an\
0:17\
apostle\
0:18\
president nelson talked about power he\
0:21\
has continued teaching about\
0:23\
power over the years since we have\
0:25\
sustained president nelson as our\
0:27\
prophet\
0:28\
he has taught about the principle of\
0:30\
power specifically\
0:32\
god's power and how we can access it\
0:36\
he has taught how we can draw upon god's\
0:38\
power as we minister to others\
0:41\
how repentance invites the power of\
0:43\
jesus christ and his atonement into our\
0:45\
lives\
0:47\
and how priesthood the power and\
0:49\
authority of god\
0:50\
blesses all who make and keep covenants\
0:53\
with him\
0:54\
president nelson has testified that\
0:56\
god's power\
0:58\
flows to all who are endowed in the\
1:00\
temple as they keep their covenants\
1:03\
i was particularly moved by a challenge\
1:06\
president\
1:06\
nelson gave in the april 2020 general\
1:10\
conference\
1:11\
he instructed us to study and pray\
1:14\
to learn more about the power and\
1:16\
knowledge with which you have been\
1:18\
endowed\
1:19\
or with which you will yet be endowed\
1:22\
in response to this challenge i have\
1:24\
studied and prayed\
1:26\
and have learned some beneficial things\
1:28\
about the power and knowledge with which\
1:30\
i have been endowed or with which i will\
1:33\
yet be\
1:34\
endowed understanding what we must do to\
1:37\
access god's power in our lives is not\
1:40\
easy but i have found it is doable by\
1:43\
studying it out in our minds\
1:45\
and praying for the holy ghost to\
1:47\
enlighten us\
1:48\
elder richard g scott offered a clear\
1:51\
definition of what the power of god is\
1:54\
it is the power to do more than we can\
1:57\
do by ourselves\
2:00\
filling our heart and even our soul with\
2:03\
the word of god\
2:04\
and the foundation of faith in jesus\
2:06\
christ is crucial to drawing upon the\
2:08\
power of god to help us in these\
2:10\
challenging times\
2:12\
without getting the word of god and\
2:14\
faith in jesus christ\
2:16\
deep into our hearts our testimonies and\
2:19\
faith may fail\
2:20\
and we may lose access to the power god\
2:23\
wants to give us\
2:25\
superficial faith is insufficient\
2:28\
only faith and the word of god that fill\
2:30\
our inner soul are sufficient to sustain\
2:33\
us\
2:34\
and to allow us to access his power\
2:37\
as sister johnson and i were raising our\
2:40\
children we encouraged each of them to\
2:42\
learn to play a musical instrument\
2:44\
but we would allow our children to take\
2:46\
music lessons only if they did their\
2:49\
part\
2:49\
and practice their instrument each day\
2:53\
one saturday our daughter jalen was\
2:56\
excited to go play with friends\
2:58\
but she had not yet practiced the piano\
3:01\
knowing she had committed to practice\
3:03\
for 30 minutes\
3:04\
she intended to set a timer because she\
3:07\
did not want to practice even one minute\
3:10\
longer than was required\
3:12\
as she walked by the microwave oven on\
3:14\
her way to the piano\
3:16\
she paused and pushed some buttons\
3:19\
but instead of setting the timer she set\
3:22\
the microwave to\
3:23\
cook for 30 minutes and push start\
3:27\
after about 20 minutes of practice she\
3:30\
walked back to the kitchen to check how\
3:32\
much time was remaining\
3:34\
and found the microwave oven on fire\
3:38\
she then ran into the backyard where i\
3:40\
was doing yard work\
3:41\
yelling that the house was on fire i\
3:44\
quickly ran into the house and indeed i\
3:46\
found the microwave oven in flames\
3:49\
in an effort to save our home from\
3:51\
burning i reached behind the microwave\
3:54\
unplugged it and used the power cord to\
3:56\
lift the burning microwave off of the\
3:58\
counter\
4:00\
hoping to be the hero and to save the\
4:02\
day as well as our home\
4:04\
i swung the flaming microwave in circles\
4:07\
with the power cord to keep it away from\
4:09\
my body\
4:10\
got to the backyard and with another\
4:12\
swinging motion flung the microwave out\
4:15\
onto the lawn\
4:17\
there we were able to extinguish the\
4:19\
fiery flames with a hose\
4:22\
what had gone wrong a microwave\
4:25\
oven needs something to absorb its\
4:28\
energy\
4:29\
and when nothing is on the inside to\
4:31\
absorb the energy\
4:33\
the oven itself absorbs the energy\
4:36\
becomes hot\
4:37\
and may catch on fire destroying itself\
4:40\
in a pile of flames and ashes\
4:42\
our entire microwave went up in flames\
4:45\
and burned because there was\
4:47\
nothing on the inside\
4:51\
likewise those who have faith in the\
4:53\
word of god deep in their hearts\
4:55\
will be able to absorb and overcome the\
4:58\
fiery darts which the adversary will\
5:00\
surely send to destroy us\
5:02\
otherwise our faith hope and conviction\
5:05\
may not endure\
5:07\
and like the empty microwave oven we\
5:10\
could become a casualty\
5:12\
i have learned that having the word of\
5:14\
god deep in my soul\
5:16\
coupled with faith in the lord jesus\
5:18\
christ and his atonement\
5:20\
allows me to draw upon the power of god\
5:22\
to overcome the adversary\
5:25\
and anything he may throw at me\
5:28\
as we face challenges we can rely upon\
5:31\
the promise of the lord\
5:32\
taught by paul for god hath not given us\
5:36\
the spirit of fear\
5:38\
but of power and of love and of a sound\
5:41\
mind\
5:42\
we know that as a child the savior grew\
5:45\
and waxed strong in spirit\
5:47\
filled with wisdom and the grace of god\
5:50\
was upon him\
5:52\
we know that as he grew older jesus\
5:54\
increased in wisdom\
5:56\
and stature and in favor with god and\
5:59\
man\
6:00\
and we know that by the time his\
6:02\
ministry commenced\
6:03\
those who heard him were astonished at\
6:06\
his doctrine\
6:08\
for his word was with power\
6:11\
through preparation the savior grew in\
6:14\
power and was able to resist\
6:16\
all of satan's temptations as we follow\
6:19\
the savior's example and prepare through\
6:21\
studying the word of god and deepening\
6:23\
our faith\
6:25\
we also can draw upon the power of god\
6:27\
to resist temptations\
6:30\
during this time of restricted gathering\
6:32\
that makes regular temple attendance\
6:34\
impossible\
6:36\
i have actually made a point to continue\
6:38\
to study and learn more about the power\
6:40\
of god that comes to us\
6:42\
as we make and keep temple covenants\
6:45\
as promised in the dedicatory prayer of\
6:48\
the kirtland temple\
6:49\
we leave the temple armed with god's\
6:52\
power\
6:53\
there is no expiration date associated\
6:56\
with the power god bestows upon those\
6:59\
who make and keep\
7:00\
temple covenants or a restriction from\
7:03\
accessing that power during a pandemic\
7:06\
his power diminishes in our lives only\
7:09\
if we\
7:10\
fail to keep our covenants and do not\
7:13\
live in a way that allows us to\
7:15\
continually\
7:16\
qualify to receive his power\
7:20\
while serving as mission leaders with my\
7:22\
dear wife in thailand lao and myanmar\
7:25\
we witness firsthand the power of god\
7:27\
that comes to those who make and keep\
7:29\
sacred covenants in the temple\
7:32\
the temple patron assistance fund made\
7:35\
it possible for many saints in these\
7:37\
three countries to attend the temple\
7:39\
after doing all they could through\
7:42\
personal sacrifice and preparation\
7:45\
i recall meeting a group of 20 faithful\
7:47\
saints from lao\
7:48\
at an airport in bangkok thailand to\
7:51\
help them transfer to another airport in\
7:53\
bangkok\
7:54\
to catch their flight to hong kong these\
7:57\
members\
7:58\
were brimming with excitement to finally\
8:00\
be traveling to the house of the lord\
8:02\
when we met these good saints upon their\
8:05\
return\
8:06\
the added gospel maturity and associated\
8:08\
power\
8:09\
resulting from receiving their temple\
8:12\
endowment\
8:12\
and entering into covenants with god\
8:15\
were\
8:16\
evident these saints clearly went forth\
8:19\
from the temple\
8:20\
armed with his power this power to do\
8:23\
more than they could do themselves\
8:25\
gave them strength to endure the\
8:27\
challenges of church membership\
8:29\
in their home country and to go forth\
8:32\
bearing exceedingly great and glorious\
8:34\
tidings in truth\
8:36\
as they continue building the lord's\
8:38\
kingdom and lao\
8:40\
during the time we have not been able to\
8:42\
attend the temple\
8:44\
have we each relied upon the covenants\
8:46\
we made in the temple to set a clear\
8:49\
unchanging course of direction in our\
8:51\
lives\
8:52\
these covenants have kept give us vision\
8:55\
and expectations regarding the future\
8:58\
and a clear determination to qualify to\
9:01\
receive all that the lord has promised\
9:03\
through our faithfulness i invite you to\
9:06\
seek the power god wants to give you\
9:09\
i testify that as we seek for this power\
9:13\
we will be blessed with a greater\
9:14\
understanding of the love our heavenly\
9:16\
father has for\
9:18\
us i testify that because heavenly\
9:20\
father\
9:21\
loves you and me he sent his beloved son\
9:25\
jesus christ to be our savior and\
9:27\
redeemer\
9:28\
i testify of jesus christ he who has all\
9:32\
power\
9:33\
and do so in the name of jesus christ\
9:48\
amen\
9:53\
you\
