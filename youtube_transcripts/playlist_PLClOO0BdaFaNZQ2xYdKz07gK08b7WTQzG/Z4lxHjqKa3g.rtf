sisters\
0:03\
it is such a joy to be with you\
0:06\
imagine someone going to a market to\
0:08\
purchase an item\
0:10\
if she pays the cashier more than the\
0:14\
item is worth\
0:15\
the cashier will give her change\
0:19\
king benjamin taught his people in\
0:21\
ancient america\
0:22\
other tremendous blessings we receive\
0:24\
from our savior jesus christ\
0:27\
he created the heavens the earth and all\
0:30\
the beauty we enjoy\
0:32\
through his loving atonement he provides\
0:35\
a way for us to be redeemed from sin\
0:38\
and death as we show our gratitude to\
0:41\
him\
0:42\
by diligently living his commandments he\
0:45\
immediately blesses us\
0:47\
leaving us always in his debt\
0:51\
he gives us much much more than the\
0:54\
value of what we can\
0:55\
ever return to him so\
0:58\
what can we give to him who paid the\
1:01\
incalculable price for our sins\
1:05\
we can give him change we can give him\
1:09\
our change it may be a change of thought\
1:13\
a change in habit or a change in the\
1:16\
direction we are headed\
1:18\
in return for his priceless payment for\
1:20\
each of us\
1:22\
the lord asks us for a change of heart\
1:26\
the change he requests from us is not\
1:28\
for his benefit but for ours\
1:31\
so unlike the purchaser at the market\
1:33\
who would take\
1:34\
back the change we offer our gracious\
1:38\
savior beckons us\
1:40\
to keep the change after hearing the\
1:43\
word spoken by king benjamin\
1:45\
his people cried out declaring that\
1:47\
their hearts had changed saying\
1:49\
because of the spirit of the lord\
1:51\
omnipotent which\
1:53\
brought a mighty change in us we have no\
1:56\
more disposition to do\
1:57\
evil but to do good continually\
2:01\
the scriptures do not say that they\
2:03\
immediately became perfect\
2:05\
rather that their desire to change\
2:08\
compelled them to action\
2:11\
their change of heart meant putting off\
2:13\
the natural man or woman\
2:15\
and yielding to the spirit as they\
2:17\
strove to become more like jesus christ\
2:20\
president henry b eyring teaches quote\
2:24\
true conversion depends on seeking\
2:26\
freely in faith\
2:28\
with great effort and some pain\
2:31\
then it is the lord who can grant the\
2:34\
miracle\
2:35\
of cleansing and change end quote\
2:38\
combining our effort with a savior's\
2:41\
ability to change us\
2:43\
we become new creatures when i was\
2:46\
younger\
2:47\
i visualized myself walking along an\
2:50\
upward vertical path towards my goal of\
2:52\
eternal life\
2:54\
each time i did or said something wrong\
2:58\
i felt myself sliding down the path only\
3:01\
to start my journey all over again\
3:04\
it was like landing on that one square\
3:07\
in the children's game shoots and\
3:09\
ladders\
3:10\
that slide you down from the top of the\
3:12\
board back to the beginning of the game\
3:15\
it was discouraging but as i began to\
3:19\
understand the doctrine of christ\
3:22\
and how to apply it daily in my life\
3:25\
i found hope jesus christ has given us a\
3:28\
continuous pattern for change\
3:30\
he invites us to exercise faith in him\
3:33\
which inspires us to repent\
3:36\
which faith and repentance bringeth a\
3:38\
change of heart\
3:40\
as we repent and turn our hearts to him\
3:44\
we gain a greater desire to make and\
3:46\
live sacred covenants\
3:48\
we endure to the end by continuing to\
3:50\
apply these principles throughout our\
3:52\
lives\
3:52\
and inviting the lord to change us\
3:56\
enduring to the end means changing to\
3:59\
the\
4:00\
end i now understand that i am not\
4:03\
starting over\
4:04\
with each failed attempt but that with\
4:07\
each try i'm continuing my process of\
4:10\
change\
4:11\
there is an inspired phrase in the young\
4:13\
women theme that states\
4:15\
i cherish the gift of repentance and\
4:18\
seek to improve\
4:19\
each day i pray that we do cherish this\
4:23\
beautiful gift\
4:24\
and that we are intentional in seeking\
4:27\
change\
4:28\
sometimes the changes we need to make\
4:30\
are associated with serious sin\
4:32\
but most often we strive to refine our\
4:35\
character\
4:36\
to align ourselves with the attributes\
4:38\
of jesus christ\
4:40\
our daily choices will either help or\
4:43\
hinder our progress\
4:45\
small but steady deliberate changes will\
4:48\
help us\
4:49\
improve do not become discouraged\
4:53\
change is a lifelong process\
4:56\
i am grateful that in our struggles to\
4:58\
change the lord\
5:00\
is patient with us through jesus christ\
5:04\
we are given the strength to make\
5:06\
lasting changes\
5:07\
as we humbly turn to him he will\
5:10\
increase our capacity to change\
5:13\
in addition to the transforming power\
5:16\
of the savior's atonement the holy ghost\
5:19\
will support\
5:20\
and guide us as we put forth our effort\
5:24\
he can even help us know what changes we\
5:26\
need to make\
5:28\
we can also find help and encouragement\
5:32\
through priesthood blessings prayer\
5:34\
fasting\
5:35\
and attending the temple likewise\
5:39\
trusted family members leaders and\
5:41\
friends\
5:42\
can be helpful in our efforts to change\
5:45\
when i was eight years old\
5:47\
my older brother lia and i would spend\
5:50\
time with our friends planting the\
5:51\
branches\
5:52\
of a neighborhood tree we loved being\
5:55\
together in the fellowship of our\
5:57\
friends\
5:58\
in the shade of that tree\
6:01\
one day lee fell out of the tree and\
6:04\
broke his arm\
6:05\
having a broken arm made it hard for him\
6:08\
to climb the tree by himself\
6:10\
but life in the tree just wasn't the\
6:13\
same without him there\
6:15\
so some of us steadied him from behind\
6:18\
while others\
6:19\
pulled on his good arm and without too\
6:22\
much effort\
6:24\
lee was back in the tree his arm was\
6:27\
still broken\
6:29\
but he was with us again enjoying our\
6:32\
friendship\
6:32\
as he healed i have often thought about\
6:36\
my experience of planing the tree\
6:39\
as being a type of our activity in the\
6:40\
gospel of jesus christ\
6:42\
in the shade of gospel branches we enjoy\
6:45\
many blessings associated with our\
6:47\
covenants\
6:48\
some may have fallen from the safety of\
6:51\
their covenants\
6:52\
and need our help climbing back into the\
6:54\
security of gospel branches\
6:56\
it can be difficult for them to come\
6:59\
back on their own\
7:01\
can we gently tug a little here\
7:04\
and hoist up a little there to help them\
7:07\
heal\
7:08\
while they enjoy our friendship\
7:11\
if you are suffering an injury from a\
7:15\
fall\
7:17\
please allow others to help you return\
7:19\
to your covenants\
7:20\
and the blessings they offer this savior\
7:24\
can help you\
7:24\
heal and change while surrounded by\
7:27\
those who love you\
7:30\
i occasionally run into friends who i\
7:32\
haven't seen for many years\
7:34\
and sometimes they say you haven't\
7:36\
changed at all\
7:38\
but each time i hear that i cringe a\
7:40\
little\
7:41\
because i hope i have changed over the\
7:43\
years\
7:44\
i hope i have changed since yesterday i\
7:47\
hope\
7:48\
i am a little kinder less judgmental\
7:51\
and more compassionate i hope i am\
7:54\
quicker to respond to the needs of\
7:56\
others\
7:57\
and i hope i am just a little bit more\
8:00\
patient\
8:02\
i love hiking in the mountains near my\
8:04\
home\
8:06\
often i get a little rock on my shoe as\
8:08\
i walk along the trail\
8:10\
eventually i stop and shake out my shoe\
8:14\
but it astounds me how long i allow\
8:16\
myself to hike in pain\
8:18\
before i stop and rid myself with the\
8:20\
irritant\
8:22\
as we travel the covenant path sometimes\
8:25\
we pick up stones in our shoes\
8:27\
in the form of poor habits sins or bad\
8:31\
attitudes\
8:32\
the quicker we shake them from our lives\
8:35\
the more joyful\
8:36\
our mortal journey will be maintaining\
8:40\
change takes effort i cannot imagine\
8:44\
stopping along the trail\
8:46\
only to put back in my shoe the annoying\
8:48\
and painful pebble i just removed\
8:51\
i would not want to do that any more\
8:54\
than a beautiful butterfly\
8:56\
would choose to return to her cocoon\
9:00\
i testify that because of jesus christ\
9:03\
we can change we can adjust our habits\
9:07\
alter our thoughts and refine our\
9:09\
character to become\
9:11\
more like him and with his help\
9:15\
we can keep the change\
9:18\
in the name of jesus christ amen\
9:37\
you\
