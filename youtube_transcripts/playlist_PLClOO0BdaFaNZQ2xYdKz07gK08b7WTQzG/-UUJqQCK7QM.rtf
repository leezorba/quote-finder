i pray for the assistance of the holy\
0:02\
ghost for all of us\
0:04\
as i share the thoughts and feelings\
0:06\
that have come to my mind and heart in\
0:08\
preparation for this general conference\
0:12\
for more than two decades before my call\
0:14\
to full-time church service\
0:16\
i worked as a university teacher and\
0:18\
administrator\
0:20\
my primary responsibility as a teacher\
0:22\
was to help\
0:23\
students learn how to learn for\
0:25\
themselves\
0:26\
and a vital element of my work was\
0:29\
creating grading\
0:30\
and providing feedback about student\
0:33\
performance on\
0:34\
tests as you may already know from\
0:37\
personal experience\
0:38\
tests typically are not the part of the\
0:40\
learning process that students like the\
0:42\
most\
0:44\
but periodic tests absolutely are\
0:46\
essential\
0:47\
to learning an effective test\
0:51\
helps us to compare what we need to know\
0:53\
with what we actually know\
0:55\
about a specific subject it also\
0:58\
provides a standard against which we can\
1:00\
evaluate our learning and development\
1:04\
likewise tests in the school of\
1:06\
mortality are a vital element of our\
1:08\
eternal progression\
1:10\
interestingly however the word test\
1:13\
is not found even one time in the\
1:16\
scriptural text of the standard works in\
1:18\
english rather words such as\
1:21\
prove examine and try are used\
1:26\
to describe various patterns of\
1:28\
demonstrating appropriately our\
1:29\
spiritual knowledge about\
1:32\
understanding of and devotion to our\
1:35\
heavenly father's eternal plan of\
1:37\
happiness\
1:38\
and our capacity to seek for the\
1:40\
blessings of the savior's atonement\
1:44\
he who authored the plan of salvation\
1:46\
described the very purpose\
1:48\
of our mortal probation using the words\
1:51\
prove\
1:52\
examine and try in ancient and modern\
1:56\
scripture\
1:58\
and we will prove them herewith to see\
2:00\
if they will do\
2:01\
all things whatsoever the lord their god\
2:03\
shall command them\
2:06\
consider this pleading by the psalmist\
2:08\
david\
2:10\
examine me o lord and prove me\
2:13\
try my reigns in my heart for thy loving\
2:16\
kindness\
2:17\
is before mine eyes and i have walked in\
2:20\
thy truth\
2:22\
and the lord declared in 1833\
2:25\
therefore be not afraid of your enemies\
2:28\
for i have decreed in my heart\
2:30\
saith the lord that i will prove you in\
2:33\
all things whether you will abide in my\
2:35\
covenant\
2:36\
even unto death that you may be found\
2:39\
worthy\
2:41\
the year 2020 has been marked in part\
2:45\
by a global pandemic that has proved\
2:47\
examined\
2:48\
and tried us in many ways i pray that we\
2:52\
as individuals and families are learning\
2:54\
the valuable lessons\
2:55\
that only challenging experiences can\
2:58\
teach us\
2:59\
i also hope that all of us will more\
3:02\
fully acknowledge\
3:03\
the greatness of god and the truth that\
3:06\
he shall consecrate\
3:07\
our afflictions for our gain\
3:11\
two basic principles can guide and\
3:13\
strengthen us as we face\
3:14\
proving and trying circumstances in our\
3:17\
lives\
3:18\
whatever they may be first the principle\
3:22\
of preparation\
3:23\
and second the principle of pressing\
3:26\
forward with a steadfastness\
3:29\
in christ first preparation\
3:34\
as disciples of the savior we are\
3:36\
commanded to prepare\
3:37\
every needful thing and establish a\
3:40\
house\
3:41\
even a house of prayer a house of\
3:43\
fasting a house of faith\
3:45\
a house of learning a house of glory a\
3:48\
house of order\
3:50\
a house of god we also\
3:53\
are promised that if ye are prepared he\
3:56\
shall not fear\
3:57\
and that ye might escape the power of\
3:59\
the enemy and be gathered unto me a\
4:01\
righteous people\
4:03\
without spot and blameless\
4:06\
these scriptures provide a perfect\
4:09\
framework\
4:10\
for organizing and preparing our lives\
4:12\
and homes both temporally\
4:14\
and spiritually our efforts to prepare\
4:17\
for the proving experiences of mortality\
4:20\
should follow the example of the savior\
4:22\
who incrementally increased in wisdom\
4:25\
and stature\
4:27\
and in favor with god and man a blended\
4:30\
balance of intellectual\
4:32\
physical spiritual and social readiness\
4:37\
on an afternoon a few months ago susan\
4:39\
and i inventoried our food storage and\
4:41\
emergency\
4:42\
supplies at the time covet 19 was\
4:45\
spreading rapidly\
4:47\
and a series of earthquakes had jolted\
4:49\
our home in utah\
4:51\
we have worked since the earliest days\
4:53\
of our marriage to follow prophetic\
4:55\
counsel about preparing for unforeseen\
4:57\
challenges\
4:59\
so examining our state of readiness in\
5:02\
the midst of the virus and earthquakes\
5:04\
seemed like a good and timely thing to\
5:06\
do\
5:08\
we wanted to find out our grades on\
5:10\
these unannounced\
5:12\
tests we learned a great deal\
5:16\
in many areas our preparatory work was\
5:18\
just right\
5:20\
in some other areas however improvement\
5:22\
was necessary\
5:24\
because we had not recognized and\
5:26\
addressed particular needs\
5:28\
in a timely way we also laughed a lot\
5:33\
we discovered for example items in a\
5:35\
remote closet\
5:36\
that had been in our food storage for\
5:39\
decades\
5:41\
frankly we were afraid to open and\
5:43\
inspect some of the containers\
5:45\
for fear of unleashing another global\
5:47\
pandemic\
5:50\
but you should be happy to know that we\
5:51\
properly disposed of the hazardous\
5:53\
materials\
5:55\
and that health risk to the world was\
5:57\
eliminated\
6:00\
some church members opine that emergency\
6:02\
plans and supplies\
6:03\
food storage and 72-hour kits must not\
6:07\
be important anymore\
6:09\
because the brethren have not spoken\
6:11\
recently and extensively about these\
6:13\
and related topics in general conference\
6:17\
but repeated admonitions to prepare\
6:21\
have been proclaimed by leaders of the\
6:23\
church for decades\
6:26\
the consistency of prophetic counsel\
6:29\
over time\
6:31\
creates a powerful concert of clarity\
6:34\
and a warning volume far louder than\
6:37\
solo performances\
6:38\
can ever produce\
6:41\
just as challenging times reveal\
6:43\
inadequacies in a\
6:45\
temporal preparedness so too the\
6:48\
maladies of spiritual\
6:50\
casualness and complacency inflict their\
6:54\
most\
6:54\
detrimental effects during difficult\
6:56\
times\
6:58\
we learn for example in the parable of\
7:00\
the ten virgins\
7:02\
that procrastinating preparation leads\
7:05\
to\
7:05\
unsuccessful proving\
7:08\
recall how the five foolish virgins\
7:11\
failed to prepare appropriately for the\
7:12\
examination given to them\
7:14\
on the day of the bridegroom's coming\
7:18\
they that were foolish took their lamps\
7:20\
and took no oil with them\
7:22\
but the wise took oil in their vessels\
7:24\
with their lamps\
7:26\
and at midnight there was a cry made\
7:28\
behold the bridegroom cometh\
7:30\
go ye out to meet him then all those\
7:32\
virgins arose and trimmed their lamps\
7:35\
and the foolish said unto the wise give\
7:37\
us of your oil for our lamps are gone\
7:40\
out\
7:41\
but the wise answered saying not so\
7:44\
lest there be not enough for us in you\
7:47\
but go ye rather to them that sell and\
7:49\
buy for yourselves\
7:51\
and while they went to buy the\
7:53\
bridegroom came and they that were ready\
7:55\
went in with him to the marriage and the\
7:57\
door was shut\
7:59\
afterward came also the other virgin\
8:02\
saying lord\
8:03\
lord open to us but he answered and said\
8:06\
verily\
8:07\
i say unto you ye know me not\
8:11\
at least on this exam the five foolish\
8:14\
virgins\
8:15\
proved themselves to be hearers only and\
8:18\
not\
8:18\
doers of the word i have a friend who\
8:22\
was a conscientious\
8:23\
student in law school during the course\
8:26\
of a semester\
8:27\
sam invested time every day to review\
8:31\
summarize and learn from his notes for\
8:33\
each course\
8:34\
in which he was enrolled he followed the\
8:37\
same pattern for all of his classes at\
8:39\
the end of\
8:40\
every week and every month\
8:43\
his approach enabled him to learn the\
8:45\
law and not merely memorize details\
8:49\
and as final examinations approached sam\
8:52\
was prepared\
8:53\
in fact he found the final exam period\
8:57\
to be one of the least stressful parts\
8:59\
of his legal training\
9:02\
effective and timely preparation\
9:05\
precedes\
9:06\
successful proving sam's approach to his\
9:10\
legal education highlights one of the\
9:12\
lord's primary patterns for growth\
9:14\
and development thus saith the lord god\
9:18\
i will give unto the children of men\
9:20\
line upon line precept upon precept hear\
9:23\
a little and there a little\
9:25\
and blessed are those who hearken unto\
9:27\
my precepts and lend an ear unto my\
9:30\
counsel\
9:31\
for they shall learn wisdom for unto him\
9:34\
that receiveth\
9:35\
i will give more i invite each of us\
9:39\
to consider our ways and examine\
9:42\
ourselves whether we be in the faith\
9:45\
and prove our own selves\
9:48\
what have we learned during these recent\
9:50\
months of lifestyle adjustments\
9:52\
and restrictions what do we need to\
9:55\
improve in our lives\
9:57\
spiritually physically socially\
9:59\
emotionally\
10:00\
and intellectually now is the time to\
10:04\
prepare\
10:05\
and prove ourselves willing and able to\
10:08\
do all things\
10:09\
whatsoever the lord our god shall\
10:11\
command us\
10:13\
second pressing forward\
10:18\
i once attended a funeral for a young\
10:20\
missionary who was killed in an accident\
10:23\
the missionary's father spoke in the\
10:24\
service and described the heartache\
10:27\
of an unexpected mortal separation from\
10:29\
a beloved child\
10:32\
he forthrightly declared that he\
10:33\
personally did not\
10:35\
understand the reasons or timing for\
10:37\
such an event\
10:39\
but i always will remember this good man\
10:42\
also declaring\
10:44\
that he knew god knew the reasons and\
10:47\
timing for the passing of his child\
10:49\
and that was good enough for him he told\
10:52\
the congregation that he and his family\
10:54\
though sorrowful\
10:56\
would be fine their testimonies remained\
10:59\
firm and steadfast\
11:01\
he concluded his remarks with this\
11:03\
declaration\
11:05\
i want you to know that as far as the\
11:07\
gospel of jesus christ is concerned\
11:09\
our family is all in\
11:12\
we are all in\
11:16\
though the loss of a dear loved one was\
11:18\
heart-wrenching and difficult the\
11:19\
members of this valiant family\
11:22\
spiritually were prepared to prove that\
11:24\
they could learn lessons of eternal\
11:26\
importance through the things that they\
11:28\
suffered\
11:31\
faithfulness is not foolishness or\
11:34\
fanaticism\
11:36\
rather it is trusting and placing our\
11:38\
confidence in jesus christ as our savior\
11:42\
on his name and in his promises\
11:46\
as we press forward with a steadfastness\
11:49\
in christ having a perfect brightness of\
11:52\
hope\
11:53\
and the love of god and of all men\
11:56\
we are blessed with an eternal\
11:58\
perspective and vision\
12:00\
that stretches far beyond our limited\
12:02\
mortal capacity\
12:04\
we will be enabled to gather together\
12:07\
and stand in holy places\
12:09\
and be not moved until the day of the\
12:12\
lord come\
12:14\
well i was serving as the president of\
12:16\
brigham young university idaho\
12:19\
elder jeffrey r holland came to the\
12:21\
campus in december of 1998\
12:24\
to speak in one of our weekly\
12:25\
devotionals\
12:27\
susan and i invited a group of students\
12:30\
to meet and visit with elder holland\
12:32\
before he delivered his message\
12:34\
as our time together was drawing to a\
12:36\
close i asked elder holland\
12:39\
if you could teach these students just\
12:41\
one thing\
12:43\
what would it be he answered quote\
12:47\
we are witnessing an ever greater\
12:49\
movement toward polarity\
12:52\
the middle ground options will be\
12:53\
removed from us as latter-day saints\
12:56\
the middle of the road will be withdrawn\
13:00\
if you are treading water in the current\
13:02\
of a river you will go somewhere\
13:04\
you simply will go wherever the current\
13:06\
takes you\
13:08\
going with the stream following the tide\
13:11\
drifting in the current will not do\
13:14\
choices have to be made not making a\
13:18\
choice\
13:19\
is a choice learn to choose\
13:22\
now close quote\
13:25\
elder holland's statement about\
13:27\
increasing polarization\
13:29\
has been proven prophetic by the\
13:31\
societal trends and events of the 22\
13:34\
years since he answered my question\
13:37\
foretelling the widening divergence\
13:39\
between the ways of the lord\
13:40\
and of the world elder holland warned\
13:43\
that the days of\
13:44\
comfortably having one foot in the\
13:46\
restored church\
13:48\
and one foot in the world were vanishing\
13:50\
quickly\
13:52\
this servant of the lord was encouraging\
13:54\
the young people to choose prepare\
13:57\
and become devoted disciples of the\
13:59\
savior\
14:01\
he was helping them to prepare and then\
14:04\
press forward to\
14:05\
and through the proving examining and\
14:09\
trying experiences\
14:10\
of their lives\
14:13\
the process of proving ourselves is a\
14:15\
fundamental part\
14:17\
of heavenly father's great plan of\
14:18\
happiness\
14:20\
i promise that as we both prepare and\
14:23\
press forward with faith in the savior\
14:25\
we all can receive the same grade on the\
14:28\
ultimate examination\
14:30\
of mortality well done\
14:33\
thou good and faithful servant thou hast\
14:36\
been faithful\
14:37\
over a few things i will make thee ruler\
14:40\
over many things enter thou into the joy\
14:44\
of thy lord i witness that god the\
14:47\
eternal father\
14:48\
is our father jesus christ is his only\
14:52\
begotten and living son\
14:54\
our savior and redeemer of these truths\
14:58\
i joyfully testify in the sacred name of\
15:01\
the lord jesus christ\
15:10\
amen\
15:19\
you\
