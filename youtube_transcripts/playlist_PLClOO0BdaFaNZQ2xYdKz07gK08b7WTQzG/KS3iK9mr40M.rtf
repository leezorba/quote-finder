what a beautiful choir singing of the\
0:04\
beautiful savior\
0:06\
i don't know how old they are now but\
0:07\
they look good there\
0:10\
in 2015 the united nations adopted what\
0:14\
was called the 2030 agenda\
0:18\
for sustainable development\
0:21\
it was described as a shared blueprint\
0:24\
for peace and prosperity\
0:26\
for people and the planet now and into\
0:30\
the future\
0:31\
the agenda for sustainable development\
0:34\
includes 17 goals to be achieved by the\
0:36\
year 2030\
0:39\
such as no poverty\
0:42\
zero hunger quality education\
0:46\
gender equality clean water and\
0:49\
sanitation\
0:51\
and decent work the concept of\
0:55\
sustainable development is an\
0:57\
interesting and important one\
1:00\
even more urgent however is the broader\
1:03\
question\
1:04\
of sustainable societies\
1:07\
what are the fundamentals that sustain a\
1:10\
flourishing society\
1:12\
one that promotes happiness progress\
1:15\
peace and well-being among its members\
1:19\
we have scriptural record of at least\
1:21\
two such thriving societies\
1:24\
what can we learn from them anciently\
1:28\
the\
1:28\
great patriarch and prophet enoch\
1:30\
preached righteousness\
1:32\
and built a city that was called the\
1:34\
city of holiness\
1:35\
even zion it is reported that the lord\
1:39\
called his people\
1:40\
zion because they were of one heart and\
1:43\
one mind\
1:44\
and dwelt in righteousness and there was\
1:47\
no poor among them\
1:50\
and the lord blessed the land and they\
1:51\
were blessed upon the mountains and upon\
1:53\
the high places\
1:54\
and did flourish\
1:58\
the first and second century peoples in\
2:00\
the western hemisphere known as nephites\
2:02\
and lamanites\
2:03\
provide another outstanding example of a\
2:06\
flourishing\
2:07\
society following the resurrected\
2:10\
savior's remarkable ministry among them\
2:13\
they did walk after the commandments\
2:15\
which they had received from their lord\
2:18\
and their god\
2:19\
continuing in fasting and prayer and in\
2:22\
meeting together oft\
2:23\
both to pray and to hear the word of the\
2:26\
lord\
2:27\
and there were no envyings nor strifes\
2:30\
nor tumults nor whoredoms nor lyings nor\
2:33\
murders\
2:34\
nor any manner of lasciviousness and\
2:37\
surely there could not be a happier\
2:39\
people\
2:40\
among all the people who'd been created\
2:43\
by the hand of god\
2:46\
the societies in these two examples were\
2:48\
sustained by the blessings of heaven\
2:51\
growing out of their exemplary devotion\
2:54\
to the two great commandments\
2:56\
thou shalt love the lord thy god with\
2:58\
all thy heart\
2:59\
and with all thy soul and with all thy\
3:02\
mind and thou shalt love thy neighbor as\
3:05\
thyself\
3:07\
they were obedient to god in their\
3:10\
personal lives\
3:11\
and they looked after one another's\
3:13\
physical and spiritual welfare\
3:16\
in the words of the doctrine and\
3:18\
covenants these were societies\
3:21\
with every man seeking the interest of\
3:23\
his neighbor\
3:25\
and doing all things with an eye single\
3:28\
to the glory of god\
3:31\
unfortunately as noted this morning by\
3:33\
elder quentin l\
3:34\
cook the ideal society described in\
3:37\
fourth nephi of the book of mormon did\
3:39\
not endure\
3:41\
beyond its second century\
3:44\
sustainability is not guaranteed\
3:47\
and a thriving society can fail in time\
3:51\
if it abandons the cardinal virtues that\
3:53\
uphold\
3:54\
its peace and prosperity in this case\
3:58\
yielding to the temptations of the devil\
4:02\
the people began to be divided into\
4:04\
classes\
4:05\
and they began to build up churches unto\
4:07\
themselves to get gain\
4:09\
and began to deny the true church of\
4:12\
christ\
4:14\
and it came to pass that when 300 years\
4:16\
had passed away\
4:17\
both the people of nephi and the\
4:19\
lamanites had become\
4:20\
exceedingly wicked one likened to\
4:23\
another\
4:25\
by the end of another century millions\
4:28\
had died in internecine warfare\
4:31\
and their once harmonious nation had\
4:34\
been reduced to warring tribes\
4:38\
reflecting on this and other examples of\
4:40\
once\
4:41\
flourishing societies that later\
4:43\
foundered\
4:44\
i think it's safe to say that when\
4:46\
people turn from a sense of\
4:48\
accountability to god\
4:50\
and begin to trust instead in the arm of\
4:53\
flesh\
4:54\
disaster lurks trusting in the arm of\
4:58\
flesh is to ignore the divine\
5:01\
author of human rights and human dignity\
5:04\
and to give highest priority to riches\
5:08\
power and the praise of the world\
5:12\
while often mocking and persecuting\
5:14\
those who follow a different\
5:15\
standard meanwhile those in sustainable\
5:19\
societies are\
5:20\
seeking as king benjamin said\
5:24\
to grow in the knowledge of the glory of\
5:26\
him that created them\
5:28\
or in the knowledge of that which is\
5:30\
just and\
5:31\
true the institutions of family and\
5:36\
religion have been crucial\
5:38\
for endowing both individuals and\
5:40\
communities\
5:41\
with the virtues that sustain an\
5:44\
enduring society\
5:46\
these virtues rooted in scripture\
5:49\
include\
5:49\
integrity responsibility and\
5:52\
accountability\
5:54\
compassion marriage and fidelity in\
5:57\
marriage\
5:59\
respect for others and the property of\
6:01\
others\
6:02\
service and the necessity and dignity of\
6:05\
work\
6:06\
among others editor-at-large\
6:09\
gerard baker wrote a column earlier this\
6:12\
year in the wall street journal honoring\
6:14\
his father\
6:15\
frederick baker on the occasion of his\
6:17\
father's 100th birthday\
6:21\
baker speculated about the reasons for\
6:23\
his father's longevity\
6:25\
but then added these thoughts while we\
6:28\
may all want to know the secret to a\
6:31\
long life\
6:32\
i often feel we'd be better off devoting\
6:34\
more time to figuring out what makes a\
6:36\
good life\
6:38\
whatever span we're allotted here i'm\
6:41\
confident i know my father's\
6:43\
secret he's from an era when life was\
6:46\
defined\
6:47\
primarily by duty not by entitlement\
6:50\
by social responsibilities not personal\
6:53\
privileges\
6:55\
the primary animating principle\
6:57\
throughout his century\
6:59\
has been a sense of obligation to family\
7:01\
god and country\
7:06\
in an era dominated by the treatise of\
7:08\
broken families\
7:10\
my father was a devoted husband to his\
7:12\
wife of 46 years\
7:15\
a dutiful father to six children he was\
7:18\
never more present and vital than when\
7:20\
my parents\
7:21\
suffered the unthinkable tragedy of\
7:23\
losing a child\
7:25\
and in an era when religion is\
7:27\
increasingly a curiosity\
7:29\
my father has lived as a true faithful\
7:32\
catholic\
7:33\
with an unshakable belief in the\
7:34\
promises of christ\
7:37\
indeed i sometimes think he's lived so\
7:39\
long because he's better prepared than\
7:41\
anyone i've ever met to die\
7:44\
i've been a fortunate man blessed by a\
7:46\
good education my own wonderful family\
7:49\
some worldly success that i didn't\
7:51\
deserve\
7:52\
but however proud and grateful i feel\
7:55\
it's eclipsed\
7:56\
by the pride and gratitude i have\
7:59\
for a man who without fuss or drama\
8:02\
without the expectation of reward or\
8:04\
even acknowledgement\
8:06\
has gone on for a century now with the\
8:10\
simple duties\
8:11\
obligations and ultimately joys\
8:14\
of living a virtuous life\
8:17\
end quote the perceived importance of\
8:22\
religion and religious faith has\
8:23\
declined in many nations in recent years\
8:27\
a growing number of people consider that\
8:29\
belief in\
8:30\
and allegiance to god are not needed for\
8:33\
moral\
8:33\
uprightness in either individuals or\
8:35\
societies in today's world\
8:38\
i think we would all agree that those\
8:41\
who profess\
8:41\
no religious belief can be and often are\
8:44\
good\
8:45\
moral people we would not agree however\
8:48\
that this happens without\
8:50\
divine influence i'm referring to the\
8:52\
light of christ\
8:55\
the savior declared i am the true light\
8:57\
that lighteth\
8:58\
every man that cometh into the world\
9:01\
whether aware of it or not every man\
9:04\
woman\
9:04\
and child of every belief place and time\
9:08\
is imbued with the light of christ and\
9:11\
therefore possesses the sense of right\
9:13\
and wrong\
9:14\
we often call conscience\
9:17\
nevertheless when secularization\
9:20\
separates\
9:21\
personal and civic virtue from a sense\
9:24\
of accountability to god\
9:26\
it cuts the plant from its roots\
9:29\
reliance on culture and tradition alone\
9:31\
will not\
9:32\
be sufficient to sustain virtue in\
9:35\
society\
9:37\
when one has no higher god than himself\
9:40\
and seeks no greater good than\
9:42\
satisfying his own appetites and\
9:44\
preferences\
9:46\
the effects will be manifest in due\
9:48\
course\
9:50\
a society for example in which the in\
9:52\
which individual consent\
9:55\
is the only constraint on sexual\
9:57\
activity is a society in decay\
10:00\
adultery promiscuity elective abortion\
10:03\
and out of wedlock births are\
10:05\
but some of the bitter fruits that grow\
10:08\
out of the immorality sanctioned by the\
10:10\
sexual revolution\
10:13\
follow-on consequences that work against\
10:16\
the sustainability of a healthy society\
10:19\
include growing numbers of children\
10:21\
raised in poverty\
10:22\
and without the positive influence of\
10:24\
fathers\
10:25\
sometimes through multiple generations\
10:28\
women bearing alone what should be\
10:30\
shared responsibilities\
10:33\
and seriously deficient education as\
10:36\
schools\
10:36\
like other institutions are tasked to\
10:40\
compensate for failure in the home\
10:43\
added to these social pathologies are\
10:46\
the incalculable instances of individual\
10:48\
heartbreak and despair mental and\
10:51\
emotional destruction visited\
10:53\
upon both the guilty and the innocent\
10:56\
nephi proclaims woe be unto him that\
10:59\
hearkeneth\
11:00\
unto the precepts of men and denieth the\
11:02\
power of god\
11:03\
and the gift of the holy ghost woe unto\
11:06\
all those who tremble\
11:08\
and are angry because of the truth of\
11:10\
god\
11:12\
in contrast our joyous message\
11:15\
to our children and to all humanity is\
11:18\
that the truth of god\
11:20\
points a better way or as paul said a\
11:22\
more excellent way\
11:24\
a way to personal happiness and\
11:27\
community\
11:28\
well-being now and to everlasting peace\
11:31\
and joy\
11:32\
hereafter the truth of god\
11:35\
refers to the core truths that underlie\
11:38\
his plan of happiness\
11:39\
for his children these truths are\
11:42\
that god lives that he is the heavenly\
11:46\
father of our spirits that as a\
11:49\
manifestation of his love\
11:51\
he's given us commandments that lead to\
11:53\
a fullness of joy with him\
11:56\
that jesus christ is the son of god and\
11:58\
our redeemer\
12:00\
that he suffered and died to atone for\
12:02\
sins on condition of our repentance\
12:05\
that he rose from the dead bringing to\
12:09\
pass the resurrection\
12:10\
of all humankind and that we will all\
12:14\
stand before him to be judged that is to\
12:17\
account for our lives\
12:20\
nine years into what was called the\
12:22\
reign of the judges in the book of\
12:24\
mormon\
12:25\
the prophet alma resigned his position\
12:28\
as chief judge\
12:29\
to give full time to his leadership of\
12:32\
the church\
12:33\
his purpose was to address the pride\
12:36\
persecution and greed\
12:38\
that were growing among the people and\
12:40\
particularly among members of the church\
12:43\
as elder stephen d nadal once observed\
12:47\
alma's inspired decision was not to\
12:49\
spend more time\
12:51\
trying to make and enforce more rules to\
12:54\
correct the behavior of his people\
12:57\
but to speak to them of the word of god\
12:59\
to teach the doctrine\
13:01\
and have their understanding of the plan\
13:03\
of redemption\
13:04\
lead them to change their behavior\
13:08\
there's much we can do as neighbors and\
13:11\
fellow citizens to contribute\
13:13\
to the sustainability and success of the\
13:16\
societies we live in\
13:18\
and surely our most fundamental and\
13:20\
enduring service\
13:22\
will be to teach and live by the truths\
13:25\
inherent in god's great plan of\
13:27\
redemption\
13:29\
as expressed in the words of the hymn\
13:32\
faith of our fathers we will love both\
13:35\
friend and foe\
13:36\
in all our strife and preach thee\
13:39\
too as love knows how by kindly words\
13:44\
and virtuous life\
13:47\
if enough of us and enough of our\
13:50\
neighbors\
13:51\
strive to make our decisions and guide\
13:54\
our lives\
13:55\
by the truth of god the moral virtues\
13:59\
needed in\
14:00\
every society will abound\
14:04\
in his love our heavenly father gave his\
14:07\
only begotten son\
14:09\
jesus christ that we might have\
14:12\
everlasting life jesus christ\
14:16\
doeth not anything save it be for the\
14:19\
benefit of the world\
14:22\
for he loveth the world even that he\
14:25\
laith down his own\
14:26\
life that he may draw all men unto him\
14:31\
wherefore he commandeth none that they\
14:33\
shall not partake of his salvation\
14:35\
behold of the cry unto any saying depart\
14:38\
from me\
14:39\
behold i say unto you nay but he saith\
14:42\
come unto me\
14:43\
all the ends of the earth buy milk and\
14:46\
honey without money and without price\
14:49\
this we declare in solemnity of heart in\
14:51\
the spirit of meekness\
14:53\
and in the name of jesus christ amen\
