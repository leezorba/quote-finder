four months ago in my study of the\
0:04\
scriptures\
0:05\
i was reading about alma's mission in\
0:07\
ammonica\
0:08\
when i came across the suggestion and\
0:10\
come follow me\
0:12\
as you read about the great blessings\
0:14\
god gave the people of nephi\
0:16\
ponder the great blessings he has given\
0:19\
you\
0:20\
i decided to make a list of god's\
0:22\
blessings to me\
0:23\
and recorded in my digital version of\
0:25\
the manual\
0:27\
in a matter of minutes i had listed 16\
0:29\
blessings\
0:31\
foremost among them were the great\
0:33\
blessings of the savior's mercy and\
0:35\
atoning sacrifice on my behalf\
0:38\
i also wrote of the blessing i had to\
0:41\
represent the savior as a young\
0:42\
missionary in portugal\
0:44\
and later with my loving eternal\
0:46\
companion patricia\
0:48\
in the brazil porto alegre south mission\
0:50\
where we serve with 522 powerful\
0:53\
wonderful missionaries speaking of\
0:56\
patricia\
0:57\
many of the blessings i recorded that\
0:59\
day are blessings we have enjoyed\
1:01\
together\
1:02\
throughout our 40 years of marriage\
1:04\
including our ceiling in the sao paulo\
1:06\
brazil temple\
1:08\
our three hun wonderful children\
1:11\
their spouses and our 13 grandchildren\
1:15\
my thoughts turned also to my righteous\
1:17\
parents who raised me in the principles\
1:19\
of the gospel\
1:21\
i was reminded in particular of a moment\
1:23\
when my loving mother knelt with me to\
1:25\
pray\
1:26\
by my bedside when i was around 10 years\
1:29\
of age\
1:31\
she must have felt that if my prayers\
1:33\
were going to reach my father in heaven\
1:35\
they would need to improve so she said\
1:39\
i will pray first and after my prayer\
1:41\
you pray\
1:43\
she continued this pattern for many\
1:45\
nights until she was confident\
1:47\
i had learned by principle and by\
1:49\
practice\
1:50\
how to speak to heavenly father i'll be\
1:53\
forever grateful\
1:54\
to her for teaching me to pray for i\
1:56\
learned that my heavenly father hears my\
1:58\
prayers and answers them\
2:01\
in fact that was another blessing that i\
2:03\
included in my list\
2:05\
the gift to be able to hear and learn\
2:08\
the will of the lord\
2:09\
an important part of heavenly father's\
2:11\
plan is the opportunity to communicate\
2:14\
with him\
2:15\
anytime we want when the savior visited\
2:18\
the americas\
2:20\
after his resurrection he repeated an\
2:22\
invitation that he had given to his\
2:24\
disciples in galilee\
2:26\
he said ask and it shall be given unto\
2:30\
you\
2:31\
seek and it shall find knock and it\
2:34\
shall be open unto you\
2:36\
for everyone that asketh receiveth and\
2:39\
he that seeketh\
2:40\
findeth and to him that knocketh it\
2:43\
shall be opened\
2:45\
our prophet president russell m nelson\
2:48\
has given a similar invitation\
2:50\
our day he said pray\
2:53\
in the name of jesus christ about your\
2:55\
concerns your fears your weaknesses\
2:57\
yes the very longings of your heart and\
3:00\
then listen\
3:02\
write the thoughts that come to your\
3:03\
mind record your feelings and follow\
3:06\
through\
3:06\
with actions that you're prompted to\
3:09\
take\
3:10\
as you repeat this process day after day\
3:13\
month after month\
3:14\
year after year you will grow into the\
3:17\
principle of revelation\
3:19\
president nelson added in coming days it\
3:22\
will not be possible to survive\
3:24\
spiritually without the guiding\
3:27\
directing\
3:28\
comforting and constant influence of the\
3:30\
holy ghost\
3:32\
why is revelation so essential to our\
3:34\
spiritual survival\
3:36\
because the world can be confusing and\
3:39\
noisy full of deception and distractions\
3:42\
communication with our father in heaven\
3:45\
enables us to sort through what is true\
3:47\
and what is false what is relevant to\
3:50\
the lord's plan for us\
3:51\
and what is not the world can also be\
3:54\
harsh and heartbreaking\
3:57\
but as we open our hearts in prayer we\
3:59\
will feel the comfort that comes from\
4:01\
our father in heaven\
4:03\
and the assurance that he loves and\
4:05\
values us\
4:07\
the lord said that everyone that asketh\
4:09\
receiveth\
4:11\
asking seems simple and yet it is\
4:13\
powerful\
4:14\
because it reveals our desires and our\
4:17\
faith\
4:18\
however it takes time and patience to\
4:20\
learn to understand the voice of the\
4:22\
lord\
4:23\
we pay attention to thoughts and\
4:24\
feelings that come to our minds and\
4:26\
hearts\
4:27\
and we write them down as our prophet\
4:29\
has counseled us to do\
4:32\
recording our impressions is an\
4:34\
important part of receiving\
4:36\
it help us recall review and refill\
4:40\
what the lord is teaching us recently a\
4:43\
loved one said to me\
4:45\
i believe personal revelation to be true\
4:48\
i believe the holy ghost will show me\
4:50\
all things i should do\
4:52\
it is easy to believe when i feel my\
4:54\
booze and burn with undoubting\
4:56\
conviction\
4:58\
but how can i have the holy ghost always\
5:01\
speak to me at this level\
5:03\
to my loved one and to all of you i\
5:05\
would say that i too would like to\
5:07\
constantly feel those strong\
5:09\
impressions from the spirit and always\
5:12\
see\
5:13\
clearly the path to follow but i don't\
5:17\
however what we might feel more often\
5:20\
is this too small voice of the lord\
5:22\
whispering to our mind and heart\
5:24\
i am here i love you go on\
5:28\
do your best i'll support you\
5:31\
we don't always need to know everything\
5:33\
or see everything\
5:35\
this still small voice is reaffirming\
5:38\
encouraging\
5:39\
and comforting and many times that's\
5:41\
just what we need for the day\
5:43\
the holy ghost is real and his\
5:45\
impressions are real\
5:47\
the big ones and the small ones\
5:50\
the lord went on to promise he that\
5:52\
seeketh\
5:53\
findeth seeking implies mental in his\
5:57\
in the spiritual effort pondering\
6:00\
testing\
6:00\
trying and studying we seek because we\
6:04\
trust the lord's promises\
6:06\
for he that cometh to god must believe\
6:09\
that he is\
6:10\
and that he is a rewarder of them that\
6:12\
diligently seek him\
6:15\
when we seek we are humbly acknowledging\
6:17\
that we still have much to learn\
6:19\
and the lord will expand our\
6:21\
understanding preparing us to receive\
6:24\
more\
6:25\
for behold thus saith the lord god i\
6:28\
will give unto the children of man\
6:30\
line upon line precept upon precept\
6:33\
here a little and there a little for\
6:36\
unto him that receiveth\
6:37\
i will give more finally the lord said\
6:41\
to him that knocketh it shall be opened\
6:45\
to knock is to act in faith when we\
6:48\
actively follow him\
6:49\
the lord opens the way before us there's\
6:53\
a beautiful hymn that teaches us\
6:55\
to wake up and do something more than\
6:58\
dream of our mansion above\
7:00\
doing good is a pleasure a joy beyond\
7:03\
measure\
7:04\
a blessing of duty and love\
7:07\
elder gary w gong of the quorum of the\
7:09\
twelve\
7:10\
recently explained that revelation often\
7:13\
comes\
7:13\
when we are in the act of doing good he\
7:16\
said\
7:18\
as we try to reach out in service to\
7:20\
those around us\
7:22\
i think the lord gives us an extra\
7:24\
measure of his love for them\
7:26\
and therefore for us i think we hear his\
7:30\
voice\
7:31\
we feel him in a different way as we\
7:33\
pray to help those around us\
7:36\
because that's one of the prayers that\
7:38\
he most wants to answer\
7:41\
that simple suggestion and come follow\
7:43\
me to think about my blessings brought a\
7:45\
sweet spirit\
7:47\
and some unexpected spiritual insights\
7:50\
as i continued reading about alma and\
7:53\
his ministry in amonaha\
7:55\
i discovered that alma provides a good\
7:57\
example of what it means to ask\
7:59\
seek and knock we read that alma labored\
8:03\
much\
8:04\
in the spirit wrestling with god in\
8:06\
mighty prayer\
8:07\
that he would pour out his spirit upon\
8:09\
the people\
8:11\
that prayer however was not answered the\
8:13\
way he hoped\
8:15\
and alma was cast out of the city way\
8:18\
down with sorrow\
8:19\
alma was about to give up when an angel\
8:22\
delivered this message\
8:24\
blessed are thou alma therefore lift up\
8:27\
thy head and rejoice\
8:29\
for thou hast great cause to rejoice\
8:33\
the angel then told him to return to a\
8:35\
monaha and try again\
8:37\
and alma returned speedly\
8:40\
what do we learn from alma about asking\
8:43\
seeking and knocking\
8:45\
we learned that prayer requires\
8:47\
spiritual labor\
8:48\
and it does not always lead to the\
8:50\
outcome we hope for\
8:52\
but when we feel discouraged or weighed\
8:55\
down with sorrow\
8:56\
the lord gives us comfort and strength\
8:59\
in different ways\
9:00\
he may not answer all of our questions\
9:03\
or solve all of our problems right away\
9:05\
rather he encourages us to keep trying\
9:10\
if we then speedily align our plan with\
9:12\
his plan\
9:13\
he will open the way for us as he did\
9:16\
for alma\
9:18\
it is my testimony that this is the\
9:20\
dispensation of the fullness\
9:22\
of the gospel we can enjoy the blessings\
9:25\
of the atonement of jesus christ in our\
9:27\
lives\
9:28\
we have these scriptures widely\
9:30\
available to us\
9:32\
we are led by prophets who teach us the\
9:35\
will of the lord for the difficult times\
9:37\
we live\
9:37\
in in addition we have direct access\
9:41\
to our own revelation so the lord can\
9:44\
comfort and guide us\
9:46\
personally as the angel said to alma\
9:49\
we have great cause to rejoice in the\
9:52\
name of jesus christ\
10:02\
amen\
10:09\
you\
