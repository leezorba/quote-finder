righteousness and unity\
0:04\
are profoundly significant when people\
0:07\
love god\
0:08\
with all their hearts and righteously\
0:10\
strive to become like him\
0:13\
there is less strife and contention in\
0:15\
society\
0:17\
there is more unity i love a true\
0:19\
account\
0:20\
that exemplifies this as a young man not\
0:23\
of our faith\
0:24\
general thomas l kane assisted and\
0:27\
defended the saints\
0:28\
as they were required to flee nauvoo he\
0:31\
was an\
0:32\
advocate for the church for many years\
0:35\
in 1872 general kane his talented wife\
0:39\
elizabeth wood cain and their two sons\
0:42\
traveled from their home in pennsylvania\
0:44\
to salt lake city\
0:46\
they accompanied brigham young and his\
0:49\
associates on a trek south to st\
0:51\
george utah elizabeth approached her\
0:55\
first visit to utah\
0:56\
with reservations about the women\
1:00\
she was surprised by some of the things\
1:02\
she learned\
1:03\
for instance she found that any career\
1:06\
by which a woman could earn a living\
1:08\
was open to them in utah she also found\
1:12\
church members were kind and\
1:14\
understanding with respect to native\
1:16\
americans\
1:18\
during the trip they stayed in fillmore\
1:19\
at the home of thomas r\
1:21\
and matilda robison king elizabeth wrote\
1:24\
that as matilda\
1:26\
was preparing a meal for president young\
1:28\
and his company\
1:30\
five american indians came into the room\
1:33\
although uninvited it was clear they\
1:36\
expected to join the company\
1:39\
sisters king spoke to them in their\
1:42\
dialect\
1:43\
they sat down with their blankets with a\
1:46\
pleasant look on their faces\
1:48\
elizabeth asked one of the king children\
1:51\
what did your mother\
1:52\
say to those men matilda's son reply was\
1:57\
she said these strangers came first\
2:00\
and i have only cooked enough for them\
2:03\
but\
2:03\
your meal is on the fire cooking now\
2:06\
and i will call you as soon as it is\
2:08\
ready\
2:10\
elizabeth asked will she really do that\
2:13\
or just give them scraps at the kitchen\
2:15\
door\
2:16\
matilda's son answered mother will serve\
2:20\
them just as she does you\
2:22\
and give them a place at her table and\
2:25\
so she did\
2:26\
and they ate with perfect propriety\
2:29\
elizabeth explained that this hostess\
2:31\
rose 100 percent\
2:33\
in her opinion unity is enhanced when\
2:37\
people\
2:38\
are treated with dignity and respect\
2:41\
even though they are different in\
2:42\
outward characteristics as leaders\
2:45\
we are not under the illusion that in\
2:48\
the past\
2:49\
all relationships were perfect all\
2:52\
conduct was christ-like\
2:54\
or all decisions were just however\
2:57\
our faith teaches that we are\
3:00\
all children of our father in heaven and\
3:03\
we worship him\
3:04\
and his son jesus christ who is our\
3:06\
savior\
3:08\
our desire is that our hearts and minds\
3:11\
will be knit in righteousness and unity\
3:14\
and we will be one with them\
3:17\
righteousness is a broad comprehensive\
3:19\
term but most certainly includes living\
3:21\
god's commandments\
3:23\
it qualifies us for the sacred\
3:25\
ordinances that constitute the covenant\
3:27\
path\
3:28\
and blesses us to have the spirit give\
3:31\
direction to our lives\
3:33\
being righteous is not dependent on each\
3:36\
of us having every blessing in our lives\
3:38\
at this time\
3:40\
we may not be married or blessed with\
3:42\
children\
3:43\
or have other desired blessings now\
3:47\
but the lord has promised that the\
3:49\
righteous who were faithful\
3:51\
may dwell with god in a state of\
3:54\
never-ending happiness\
3:56\
unity is also a broad comprehensive term\
3:58\
but most certainly exemplifies the\
4:01\
first and second great commandments to\
4:04\
love god and love our fellow men\
4:06\
it denotes a zion people whose hearts\
4:09\
and minds are knit\
4:10\
together in unity the context for\
4:14\
my message is the contrast and lessons\
4:16\
from sacred scriptures\
4:18\
it has been 200 years since the father\
4:20\
and his son first appeared\
4:22\
and commenced the restoration of the\
4:24\
gospel of jesus christ in\
4:27\
the account in fourth nephi in the book\
4:30\
of mormon includes a\
4:31\
similar 200-year period after the savior\
4:35\
appeared\
4:36\
and established his church in ancient\
4:38\
america\
4:39\
the historical record we read in fourth\
4:42\
nephi\
4:43\
describes a people where there were no\
4:45\
endings strifes tumults\
4:47\
lines murders or any manner of\
4:50\
lasciviousness\
4:52\
because of this righteousness the record\
4:54\
states\
4:56\
surely there could not be a happier\
4:58\
people among\
4:59\
all the people who had been created by\
5:02\
the hand of god\
5:04\
with respect to unity fourth nephi reads\
5:07\
there was no contention in the land\
5:09\
because of the love of god which did\
5:11\
well in the hearts of the people\
5:14\
unfortunately fourth nephi then\
5:16\
describes a dramatic change that began\
5:18\
in the 200th\
5:19\
and first year when iniquity and\
5:22\
division destroyed righteousness\
5:24\
and unity the depths of depravity that\
5:27\
then occurred\
5:28\
were subsequently so evil that\
5:30\
ultimately the great prophet mormon\
5:32\
laments\
5:33\
to his son moroni but oh my son\
5:36\
how to how can a people like this whose\
5:39\
delight is in so much abomination\
5:42\
how can we expect that god will stay his\
5:44\
hand in judgment\
5:46\
against us in this dispensation\
5:49\
although we live in a special time the\
5:52\
world has not been blessed with the\
5:54\
righteousness and unity\
5:55\
described in fourth nephi indeed\
5:58\
we live in a moment of particularly\
6:01\
strong divisions\
6:03\
however the millions who have accepted\
6:05\
the gospel of jesus christ\
6:06\
have committed themselves to achieving\
6:09\
both righteousness and unity\
6:11\
we are all aware that we can do better\
6:14\
and that is our challenge in this day\
6:17\
we can be a force to lift and bless\
6:20\
society as a whole\
6:22\
at this 200-year hinge point\
6:25\
in our church history let us commit\
6:28\
ourselves as members of the lord's\
6:30\
church to live righteously\
6:32\
and be united as never before president\
6:35\
russell m nelson has asked us\
6:37\
to demonstrate greater civility racial\
6:40\
and ethnic harmony\
6:41\
and mutual respect this means loving\
6:44\
each other and god\
6:46\
and accepting everyone as brothers and\
6:49\
sisters\
6:50\
and truly being a zion people\
6:53\
with our all-inclusive doctrine we can\
6:56\
be an oasis of unity\
6:58\
and celebrate diversity unity and\
7:01\
diversity are not opposites\
7:04\
we can achieve greater unity as we\
7:07\
foster an atmosphere of inclusion\
7:09\
and respect for diversity during the\
7:12\
period i served in the san francisco\
7:14\
california steak presidency\
7:17\
we had spanish tongan samoan\
7:20\
tagalog and mandarin language speaking\
7:22\
congregations\
7:24\
our english speaking wards were composed\
7:26\
of people from many racial and cultural\
7:28\
backgrounds\
7:29\
there was love righteousness and unity\
7:33\
wards and branches in the church of\
7:34\
jesus christ of latter-day saints are\
7:36\
determined by geography or language\
7:39\
not by race or culture race is not\
7:43\
identified\
7:44\
on membership records early in the book\
7:47\
of mormon approximately 500 years before\
7:49\
the birth of christ\
7:51\
we are taught the fundamental\
7:53\
commandment regarding the relationship\
7:55\
between father and heaven's children\
7:57\
we are to keep the lord's commandments\
8:00\
and all are invited to partake of the\
8:03\
lord's goodness\
8:05\
and he denieth none that come unto him\
8:07\
black and white\
8:08\
bond and free male and female and he\
8:11\
remembereth the heaven\
8:13\
and all are alike unto god both jew and\
8:15\
gentile\
8:17\
the savior's ministry and message have\
8:19\
consistently declared\
8:21\
all races and colors are children of god\
8:24\
we are all brothers and sisters\
8:28\
in our doctrine we believe that in the\
8:29\
host country for the restoration\
8:31\
the united states the u.s constitution\
8:34\
and related documents\
8:36\
written by imperfect men were inspired\
8:39\
by god to bless\
8:41\
all people as we read in the doctrine\
8:44\
and covenants these documents\
8:45\
were established and should be\
8:47\
maintained\
8:49\
for the rights and protection of all\
8:51\
flesh\
8:52\
according to just and holy principles\
8:55\
two of these principles were agency and\
8:57\
accountability for one's own sins\
9:00\
the lord declared therefore it is not\
9:03\
right that any man should be in bondage\
9:06\
one to another and for this purpose have\
9:09\
i established the constitution of this\
9:11\
land\
9:12\
by the hands of wise men whom i raised\
9:14\
up unto this very purpose\
9:16\
and redeemed the land by the shedding of\
9:18\
blood\
9:20\
this revelation was received in 1833\
9:22\
when the saints in missouri were\
9:24\
suffering great persecution\
9:26\
the heading to doctrine and covenants\
9:28\
section 101\
9:30\
reads in part mobs had driven them from\
9:32\
their homes in jackson county\
9:35\
threats of death against members of the\
9:37\
church were many\
9:38\
this was a time of tension on\
9:42\
several fronts many missourians\
9:44\
considered native americans\
9:46\
a relentless enemy and wanted them\
9:47\
removed from the land\
9:49\
in addition many of the missouri\
9:51\
settlers were slave owners\
9:52\
and felt threatened by those who were\
9:54\
opposed to slavery\
9:56\
in contrast our doctrine respected the\
10:00\
native americans and our desire was to\
10:02\
teach them the gospel of jesus christ\
10:05\
with respect to slavery our scriptures\
10:07\
had made it clear\
10:09\
that no man should be in bondage to\
10:11\
another\
10:12\
ultimately the saints were driven out of\
10:14\
missouri and then forced to move to the\
10:16\
west\
10:17\
the saints prospered and found the peace\
10:19\
that accompanies righteousness unity and\
10:21\
living the gospel of jesus christ\
10:24\
i rejoice in the savior's intercessory\
10:26\
prayer recorded in the gospel of john\
10:28\
the savior acknowledged\
10:30\
that the father had sent him and that he\
10:32\
the savior had finished the work he was\
10:34\
sent to do\
10:36\
he prayed for his disciples and for\
10:38\
those who will believe in christ\
10:40\
that they may be one as thou father art\
10:43\
in me\
10:44\
and i in thee that they may\
10:47\
that they may be one in us oneness is\
10:50\
what christ prayed for\
10:51\
prior to his betrayal and crucifixion\
10:55\
in the first year after restoration of\
10:56\
the gospel of jesus christ recorded in\
10:58\
section 38 of the doctrine of covenants\
11:01\
the lord speaks of wars and wickedness\
11:03\
and declares\
11:04\
i say unto you be one and if you are not\
11:07\
one\
11:07\
you are not mine our church culture\
11:10\
comes from the gospel of jesus christ\
11:12\
the epistle of the apostle paul to the\
11:14\
romans is profound\
11:16\
the early church in rome was composed of\
11:18\
jews and gentiles\
11:20\
these early jews had a judaic culture\
11:23\
and had won their emancipation\
11:25\
and began to multiply and flourish\
11:28\
the gentiles in rome had a culture with\
11:30\
a significant\
11:31\
hellenistic influence which the apostle\
11:34\
paul\
11:34\
understood well because of his\
11:37\
experiences\
11:38\
at athens and corinth paul sets forth\
11:41\
the gospel of jesus christ in a\
11:43\
comprehensive fashion\
11:45\
he chronicles pertinent aspects of both\
11:48\
judaic and gentile culture\
11:50\
that conflict with the true gospel of\
11:52\
jesus christ\
11:54\
he essentially asks each of them to\
11:57\
leave behind\
11:57\
cultural impediments from their beliefs\
12:00\
and culture\
12:01\
that are not consistent with the gospel\
12:03\
of jesus christ\
12:05\
paul admonishes the jews and the\
12:07\
gentiles to keep the commandments love\
12:10\
one another\
12:11\
and that righteousness leads to\
12:13\
salvation\
12:15\
the culture of the gospel of jesus\
12:17\
christ is not a gentile culture or a\
12:19\
jude\
12:20\
culture it is not determined by the\
12:22\
color of one's skin\
12:24\
or where one lives while we rejoice\
12:27\
in distinctive cultures we should leave\
12:30\
behind\
12:31\
aspects of those cultures that conflict\
12:34\
with the gospel of jesus christ our\
12:38\
members and new converts\
12:40\
often come from diverse racial and\
12:42\
cultural backgrounds\
12:44\
if we are to follow president nelson's\
12:46\
admonition to gather scattered israel\
12:49\
we will find we are as different as the\
12:52\
jews and gentiles were\
12:54\
in paul's time yet we can be united\
12:58\
in our love of and faith in jesus christ\
13:03\
paul's epistle to the romans establishes\
13:06\
the principle\
13:08\
that we follow the culture and doctrine\
13:11\
of the gospel of jesus christ it is the\
13:13\
model for us\
13:15\
even today the ordinances of the temple\
13:19\
unite us in special ways and allow us to\
13:22\
be one\
13:23\
in every eternally significant way\
13:26\
we honor our pioneer members across the\
13:30\
world\
13:31\
not because they were perfect but\
13:34\
because they overcame hardships\
13:37\
made sacrifices aspired to be\
13:40\
christ-like\
13:42\
and were striving to build faith and be\
13:44\
one with the savior\
13:47\
their one was oneness with the savior\
13:50\
made them one with each other this\
13:53\
principle\
13:54\
is true for you and me today\
13:57\
the clarion call to members of the\
13:59\
church of jesus christ\
14:01\
of latter-day saints is to strive to be\
14:04\
a zion people\
14:06\
who are of one heart and one mind\
14:10\
and dwell in righteousness it is my\
14:13\
prayer\
14:14\
that we will be righteous and united\
14:17\
and completely focused on serving and\
14:20\
worshiping\
14:21\
our savior jesus christ of whom i\
14:24\
testify\
14:26\
in the name of jesus christ amen\
14:44\
you\
