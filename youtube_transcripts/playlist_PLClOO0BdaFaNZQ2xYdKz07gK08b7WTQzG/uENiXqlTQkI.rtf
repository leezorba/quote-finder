brothers and sisters\
0:03\
i believe in angels and i would like to\
0:06\
share with you\
0:07\
my experiences with them in doing so\
0:11\
i hope and pray that we will recognize\
0:14\
the importance of angels in our lives\
0:18\
here are elder jeffrey r holland's words\
0:21\
from a past\
0:22\
general conference quote\
0:25\
when we speak of those who are\
0:27\
instruments in the hand of god\
0:29\
we are reminded that not all angels are\
0:32\
from the other side of the veil\
0:34\
some of them we walk with and talk with\
0:38\
here now every day some of them reside\
0:40\
in our own neighborhoods\
0:43\
indeed heaven never seems closer than\
0:46\
when we see the love of god\
0:48\
manifested in the kindness and devotion\
0:51\
of people so good and so pure\
0:54\
that angelic is the only word that comes\
0:57\
to mind close quote\
1:00\
it is about angels on this side of the\
1:02\
veil that i want to talk\
1:05\
the angels that walk among us in every\
1:08\
in our everyday lives are powerful\
1:11\
reminders of\
1:12\
god's love for us the first angels that\
1:15\
i\
1:16\
will mention are the two sister\
1:17\
missionaries who taught me the gospel\
1:19\
when i was a young man\
1:20\
sister vuma molina and sister ivan\
1:23\
achivich\
1:25\
my younger sister and i were invited to\
1:27\
a church activity\
1:28\
where we met these two angels i never\
1:32\
imagined how much that simple activity\
1:34\
would change my life\
1:36\
my parents and siblings were not\
1:37\
interested in learning more about the\
1:39\
church at that time\
1:41\
they were not even willing to have the\
1:42\
missionaries in our home\
1:44\
so i took the missionary lessons in a\
1:46\
church building\
1:48\
that small room in the chapel became my\
1:50\
sacred grove\
1:53\
one month after these angels introduced\
1:55\
me to the gospel\
1:56\
i was baptized i was 16 years old\
2:00\
unfortunately i don't have a picture of\
2:03\
that sacred event\
2:04\
but i do have a picture of my sister and\
2:07\
me\
2:08\
at the time we participated in that\
2:10\
activity\
2:12\
i may need to clarify who is who in this\
2:14\
picture\
2:16\
i am the taller one on the right\
2:20\
as you can imagine remaining active in\
2:23\
the church\
2:24\
was not challenging was it was\
2:26\
challenging for a teenager\
2:27\
whose lifestyle had just changed and\
2:30\
whose family\
2:31\
was not taking the same path\
2:34\
as i was trying to adjust to my new life\
2:37\
a new culture\
2:38\
and new friends i felt out of place\
2:41\
i felt alone and discouraged many times\
2:45\
i knew the church was true but i had a\
2:48\
hard time feeling part of it\
2:50\
while uncomfortable and uncertain as i\
2:52\
tried to fit into my new religion\
2:55\
i found the courage to participate in a\
2:58\
three-day youth conference\
3:00\
which i thought would help me make new\
3:03\
friends\
3:05\
this is when i met another saving angel\
3:08\
named monica brandon\
3:12\
she was new in the area having moved\
3:15\
from another part of brazil\
3:17\
she quickly got my attention and luckily\
3:20\
for me\
3:21\
accepted me as a friend i guess she was\
3:25\
she looked at me more from the inside\
3:28\
than the outside\
3:31\
because she befriended me i was\
3:33\
introduced to her friends who then\
3:35\
became my friends as we enjoyed many\
3:37\
youth activities i attended later\
3:41\
those activities were so critical to my\
3:43\
integration\
3:44\
into this new life\
3:47\
these good friends made a big difference\
3:49\
but not having the gospel\
3:51\
taught in my home with a supportive\
3:53\
family still put my ongoing conversion\
3:55\
process at risk my gospel interactions\
3:59\
in the church became\
4:00\
even more crucial to my growing\
4:01\
conversion\
4:03\
then two additional angels were sent by\
4:06\
the lord to help\
4:07\
one of them was ledavitori my early\
4:10\
morning seminary teacher\
4:12\
through her accepting love and inspiring\
4:14\
classes she gave me a daily dose of the\
4:17\
good word of god\
4:18\
which was so needed throughout my day\
4:21\
this helped me to gain the spiritual\
4:23\
strength to keep going\
4:26\
another angel sent to help was the young\
4:28\
man president marco antonio fusco\
4:31\
he was also assigned to be my senior\
4:33\
home teaching companion\
4:35\
despite my lack of experience and\
4:38\
different appearance\
4:39\
he gave me assignments to teach in our\
4:41\
pre-school meetings and home teaching\
4:44\
visits\
4:45\
he gave me the chance to act and to\
4:48\
learn\
4:48\
and not just be an observer of the\
4:50\
gospel he trusted me more than i trusted\
4:53\
myself\
4:55\
thanks to all these angels and many\
4:57\
others i encountered during those\
4:58\
important early years\
5:00\
i received enough strength to remain on\
5:03\
the covenant path\
5:04\
as i gain a spiritual witness of the\
5:06\
truth\
5:08\
and by the way that young angel girl\
5:11\
monica\
5:14\
after we both submissions she became my\
5:17\
wife\
5:19\
i don't think it was coincidence that\
5:21\
good friends\
5:23\
church responsibilities and nurturing by\
5:25\
the good word of god\
5:27\
were part of this that process president\
5:29\
hinckley wisely taught\
5:32\
quote it is not an easy thing to make\
5:35\
the transition\
5:36\
incident to in this church it means\
5:38\
cutting old ties\
5:40\
it means leaving friends it means it may\
5:42\
mean\
5:43\
sitting aside cherished beliefs it may\
5:46\
require a change of habits and a\
5:48\
suppression of\
5:49\
appetites in so many cases it means\
5:53\
loneliness and even fear of the unknown\
5:56\
there must be nurturing and\
5:58\
strengthening during this difficult\
6:00\
season\
6:01\
of a converts life later he added\
6:05\
every one of them needs three things a\
6:08\
friend\
6:09\
a responsibility and nurturing with the\
6:12\
good word of god\
6:15\
why i'm sharing these experiences with\
6:17\
you\
6:19\
first it is to send a message to those\
6:22\
going through a similar process right\
6:24\
now maybe\
6:25\
you are a new convert or coming back to\
6:28\
the church after wandering around for a\
6:30\
while\
6:31\
or just someone struggling to fit in\
6:35\
please please don't do not give up on\
6:38\
your efforts to be part of this big\
6:40\
family\
6:41\
it is the true church of jesus christ\
6:44\
when it comes to your happiness and\
6:46\
salvation it is\
6:48\
always worth the effort to keep trying\
6:51\
it is worth the effort to adjust your\
6:53\
lifestyle\
6:54\
and traditions the lord is aware of the\
6:58\
challenges you face\
7:00\
he knows you he loves you and i promise\
7:04\
he will send angels to help you\
7:08\
in his own words the savior said\
7:11\
have you go before your face i will be\
7:13\
in your your\
7:15\
right hand on and on your left\
7:18\
my spirit shall be in your heart\
7:21\
and my angels round about you to bear\
7:23\
you up\
7:26\
my second purpose for sharing these\
7:28\
experiences\
7:29\
is to send a message to all members of\
7:31\
the church to all of us\
7:34\
we should remember that it's not an easy\
7:36\
it's not easy for new converts\
7:38\
returning friends and those with a\
7:41\
different lifestyle\
7:43\
to instantly fit in the lord is aware\
7:46\
of the challenge they face and he is\
7:49\
looking for\
7:50\
angels willing to help the lord is\
7:53\
always looking for willing volunteers\
7:55\
to be angels in others lives\
8:00\
brothers and sisters would you be\
8:01\
willing to be an instrument\
8:03\
in the lord's hands would you be willing\
8:06\
to be one of these angels\
8:09\
to be an emissary sent from god from\
8:12\
this side of the veil\
8:13\
for someone who is he is worthy about\
8:17\
he needs you they need you\
8:20\
of course we can always count on our\
8:22\
missionaries they are always\
8:24\
there the first ones to enlist for this\
8:27\
angelical job\
8:28\
but they are not enough if you look\
8:31\
around\
8:31\
carefully you will find many in need of\
8:34\
an\
8:35\
angel's help these people may not be\
8:38\
wearing white shirts dresses or any\
8:41\
standard\
8:42\
sunday attire they may be sitting alone\
8:46\
towards the back of the chapel or\
8:47\
classroom sometimes feeling\
8:50\
as if they are invisible\
8:53\
maybe their hairstyle is a little\
8:54\
extreme or their\
8:56\
vocabulary is different but they are\
8:59\
there\
9:00\
and they are trying some may be\
9:03\
wondering should i keep coming back\
9:05\
should i keep trying others may be\
9:08\
wondering if one day they will feel\
9:10\
accepted and loved\
9:12\
angels are needed right now angels who\
9:15\
are willing to leave their comfort zone\
9:18\
to embrace them people who are so good\
9:21\
and so pure that angelic is the only\
9:24\
word\
9:25\
that comes to mind to describe them\
9:29\
brothers and sisters i believe in angels\
9:32\
we are all here today a giant army of\
9:35\
angels\
9:36\
set apart for the for these latter days\
9:39\
to minister\
9:40\
to others as extensions of the hands\
9:44\
of a loving creator i promise that if we\
9:47\
are willing to serve\
9:48\
the lord will give us opportunities to\
9:50\
be ministering angels\
9:53\
he knows who needs angelic help and he\
9:56\
will\
9:56\
and he will put them in our path the\
9:59\
lord puts\
10:00\
those who needs angelic help on our path\
10:03\
daily\
10:05\
i'm so grateful for the many angels that\
10:07\
the lord has put in my path\
10:09\
throughout my life they were needed\
10:12\
i'm also grateful for his gospel that\
10:15\
help us\
10:16\
to change and give us the chance to be\
10:19\
better\
10:20\
this is a gospel of love a gospel of\
10:24\
ministry\
10:25\
of this i testify in the name of jesus\
10:28\
christ\
10:30\
amen\
