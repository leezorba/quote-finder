my dear brothers and sisters\
0:03\
how grateful i am for this marvelous for\
0:06\
the marvelous messages of this\
0:07\
conference\
0:09\
and for my privilege to speak with you\
0:11\
now\
0:14\
for the more than 36 years\
0:17\
i've been an apostle the doctrine\
0:21\
of the gathering of israel has captured\
0:24\
my attention\
0:26\
everything about it has intrigued me\
0:30\
including the ministries and names of\
0:32\
abraham\
0:33\
isaac and jacob their lives and their\
0:37\
wives\
0:38\
the covenant god made with them and\
0:40\
extended through their lineage\
0:44\
the dispersion of the twelve tribes\
0:47\
and the numerous prophecies about the\
0:50\
gathering\
0:51\
in our day i have studied the gathering\
0:56\
prayed about it feasted upon every\
0:58\
related scripture\
1:00\
and asked the lord to increase my\
1:02\
understanding\
1:05\
so imagine my delight when i was led\
1:09\
recently to a new insight\
1:13\
with the help of two hebrew scholars i\
1:16\
learned that\
1:17\
one of the hebraic meanings of the word\
1:20\
israel is\
1:24\
let god prevail\
1:28\
thus the very name of israel\
1:31\
refers to a person who is willing\
1:34\
to let god prevail in his\
1:37\
or her life that concept stirs my\
1:41\
soul\
1:44\
the word willing is crucial to this\
1:47\
interpretation of\
1:49\
israel we all have our agency\
1:54\
we can choose to be of israel or not\
1:59\
we can choose to let god prevail in our\
2:02\
lives\
2:03\
or not we can choose to let god be the\
2:08\
most powerful influence in our lives\
2:11\
or not\
2:15\
for a moment let us recall a crucial\
2:18\
turning point\
2:20\
in the life of jacob the grandson of\
2:23\
abraham\
2:25\
at the place jacob named peniel\
2:30\
which means the face of god\
2:34\
jacob wrestled with a serious challenge\
2:37\
his agency was tested through this\
2:41\
wrestle jacob\
2:42\
proved what was most important to him\
2:46\
he demonstrated that he was willing\
2:50\
to let god prevail in his life\
2:55\
in response god changed jacob's name\
3:00\
to israel meaning\
3:04\
let god prevail\
3:08\
god then promised israel that all the\
3:11\
blessings that had been pronounced upon\
3:13\
abraham's head would also be his\
3:19\
sadly israel's posterity broke\
3:22\
their covenants with god they stoned the\
3:26\
prophets\
3:27\
and were not willing to let god prevail\
3:30\
in their lives\
3:33\
subsequently god scattered them to the\
3:35\
four corners of the earth\
3:38\
mercifully he later promised\
3:41\
to gather them as reported by isaiah\
3:47\
for a small moment have i forsaken thee\
3:50\
israel but with great\
3:53\
mercies will i gather thee\
4:00\
a hebraic definition of israel in mind\
4:03\
the gathering of israel takes on added\
4:06\
meaning\
4:07\
the lord is gathering those who are\
4:10\
willing to let god\
4:11\
prevail in their lives\
4:14\
the lord is gathering those who will\
4:16\
choose to let god\
4:18\
be the most important influence in their\
4:21\
lives\
4:25\
for centuries prophets have foretold\
4:28\
this gathering\
4:30\
and it is happening right now\
4:35\
as an essential prelude to the second\
4:38\
coming of the lord it is the most\
4:41\
important\
4:42\
work in the world\
4:46\
this pre-millennial gathering is an\
4:49\
individual\
4:50\
saga of expanding faith and spiritual\
4:53\
courage for\
4:54\
millions of people\
4:57\
and as members of the church of jesus\
4:59\
christ of latter-day saints or\
5:02\
latter-day covenant israel\
5:06\
we have been charged to assist the lord\
5:10\
with this pivotal work\
5:14\
when we speak of gathering israel on\
5:17\
both sides of the veil we are referring\
5:19\
of course to\
5:20\
missionary temple and family history\
5:22\
work\
5:25\
we're also referring to building faith\
5:27\
and testimony in the hearts of those\
5:29\
with whom we live\
5:31\
work and serve\
5:34\
any time we do anything that helps\
5:36\
anyone\
5:38\
on either side of the veil to make\
5:41\
and keep their covenants with god\
5:44\
we are helping to gather israel\
5:51\
not long ago the wife of one of our\
5:54\
grandsons was struggling spiritually\
5:58\
i will call her jill\
6:01\
despite fasting prayer and priesthood\
6:04\
blessings\
6:06\
jill's father was dying\
6:10\
she was gripped with fear that she would\
6:12\
lose\
6:13\
both her dad and her testimony\
6:18\
late one evening my wife sister wendy\
6:21\
nelson\
6:22\
told me of jill's situation\
6:26\
the next morning wendy felt impressed to\
6:28\
share with jill that\
6:30\
my response to her spiritual wrestle was\
6:32\
one word\
6:35\
the word was myopic\
6:40\
jill later admitted to wendy that\
6:43\
initially she was\
6:44\
devastated by my response\
6:47\
she said i was hoping for grandfather to\
6:50\
promise me a miracle for my dad\
6:52\
i kept wondering why the word myopic was\
6:55\
the one\
6:56\
he felt compelled to say\
7:01\
after jill's father passed on\
7:04\
the word myopic kept coming to her mind\
7:09\
she opened her heart to understand even\
7:11\
more deeply\
7:13\
that myopic meant nearsighted\
7:18\
and her thinking began to shift\
7:22\
jill then said quote\
7:25\
my output caused me to stop think\
7:30\
and heal that word now fills me with\
7:34\
peace\
7:36\
it reminds me to expand it by\
7:38\
perspective\
7:39\
and seek the eternal\
7:43\
it reminds me that there is a divine\
7:45\
plan\
7:46\
that my dad still lives\
7:49\
and loves and looks out for me\
7:54\
myopic has led me to god\
7:58\
close quote\
8:01\
i'm very proud of our precious\
8:03\
granddaughter-in-law\
8:05\
during this heart-wrenching time in her\
8:07\
life\
8:09\
dear jill is learning to embrace god's\
8:11\
will for her dad\
8:13\
with an eternal perspective for her own\
8:16\
life\
8:18\
by choosing to let god prevail\
8:21\
she is finding peace\
8:27\
if we will allow it there are many ways\
8:30\
this hebraic\
8:31\
interpretation of israel\
8:34\
can help us imagine\
8:38\
our prayers for our missionaries and for\
8:40\
our own efforts to gather israel\
8:42\
could change with this concept in mind\
8:47\
we often pray that we and the\
8:49\
missionaries will be led to those who\
8:51\
are prepared to receive the truths of\
8:53\
the restored gospel of jesus christ\
8:57\
i wonder to whom will we be led\
9:02\
when we plead to find those who are\
9:04\
willing to let god\
9:06\
prevail in their lives\
9:10\
we may be led to some who have never\
9:12\
believed in god or jesus christ\
9:16\
but who are now yearning to learn about\
9:18\
them\
9:19\
and their plan of happiness\
9:23\
others may have been born in the\
9:26\
covenant\
9:27\
but have since wandered away from the\
9:30\
covenant path\
9:34\
they may now be ready to repent\
9:37\
return and let god prevail\
9:41\
we can assist him by welcoming them with\
9:44\
open arms and hearts\
9:46\
and some to whom we may be led may have\
9:50\
always felt there was something missing\
9:52\
in their lives\
9:54\
they too are longing for the wholeness\
9:57\
and\
9:57\
joy that come to those who are willing\
10:01\
to let\
10:02\
god prevail in their lives\
10:07\
the gospel net to gather scattered\
10:10\
israel\
10:10\
is expansive there is room for each\
10:14\
person\
10:14\
who will fully embrace the gospel of\
10:17\
jesus christ\
10:21\
each convert becomes one of god's\
10:24\
covenant children whether by birth or by\
10:28\
adoption\
10:30\
each becomes a full heir to all that\
10:33\
god has promised the faithful children\
10:36\
of israel\
10:41\
each of us has a divine potential\
10:44\
because each is a child of god\
10:49\
each is equal in his eyes\
10:53\
the implications of this truth are\
10:55\
profound\
10:58\
brothers and sisters please listen\
11:00\
carefully to what i'm about to say\
11:04\
god does not love one race more than\
11:07\
another\
11:10\
his doctrine on this matter is clear\
11:13\
he invites all to come unto him\
11:17\
black and white bond and free male and\
11:20\
female\
11:23\
i assure you that your standing before\
11:25\
god is not determined by the color of\
11:27\
your skin\
11:30\
favor or disfavor with god is dependent\
11:33\
upon your devotion to god\
11:36\
and his commandments and not\
11:39\
to the color of your skin\
11:43\
i grieve that our black brothers and\
11:45\
sisters during the\
11:47\
the world over are enduring the pains of\
11:51\
racism and prejudice\
11:54\
today i call upon our members everywhere\
11:57\
to lead out\
11:58\
in abandoning attitudes and actions of\
12:01\
prejudice\
12:03\
i plead with you to promote respect\
12:07\
for all of god's children\
12:11\
the question for each of us regardless\
12:14\
of race\
12:16\
is the same are you willing\
12:19\
to let god prevail in your life\
12:24\
are you willing to let god be the most\
12:26\
important influence\
12:27\
in your life will you allow\
12:31\
his words his commandments and his\
12:34\
covenants\
12:35\
to influence what you do each day\
12:39\
will you allow his voice to take\
12:42\
priority\
12:42\
over any other\
12:46\
are you willing to let whatever he need\
12:48\
you to do\
12:49\
take precedence over every other\
12:52\
ambition\
12:55\
are you willing to have your will\
12:58\
swallowed up in his\
13:03\
consider how such willingness could\
13:06\
bless you\
13:09\
if you are unmarried and seeking an\
13:11\
eternal companion\
13:13\
your desire to be of israel\
13:17\
will help you decide whom to date and\
13:19\
how\
13:23\
if you are married to a companion who\
13:25\
has broken his or her covenants\
13:29\
your willingness to let god prevail in\
13:31\
your life\
13:33\
will allow your covenants with god to\
13:35\
remain intact\
13:38\
the savior will heal your broken heart\
13:42\
the heavens will open as you seek to\
13:45\
know how to move forward\
13:48\
you do not need to wander\
13:51\
or wonder\
13:56\
if you have sincere questions about the\
13:59\
gospel or the church\
14:01\
as you choose to let god prevail\
14:05\
you will be led to find and understand\
14:07\
the absolute\
14:09\
eternal truths that will guide your life\
14:12\
and help you to stay\
14:14\
firmly on the covenant path\
14:19\
when you are faced with temptation\
14:22\
even if the temptation comes when you\
14:24\
are exhausted or\
14:26\
feeling alone or misunderstood\
14:30\
imagine the courage you can muster\
14:33\
as you choose to let god prevail in your\
14:35\
life\
14:36\
as you plead with him to strengthen you\
14:42\
when your greatest desire is to let\
14:45\
god prevail to be part of\
14:49\
israel so many decisions become easier\
14:55\
so many issues become non-issues\
14:59\
you know how best to groom yourself\
15:03\
you know what to watch and read\
15:07\
or to spend your time and with whom to\
15:10\
associate\
15:12\
you know what you want to accomplish and\
15:15\
you know\
15:16\
the kind of person you really\
15:19\
want to become\
15:24\
now my dear brothers and sisters it\
15:26\
takes both faith\
15:28\
and courage to let god prevail\
15:33\
it takes persistent rigorous spiritual\
15:36\
work to repent and to put off the\
15:38\
natural man through the atonement of\
15:40\
jesus christ\
15:42\
it takes consistent daily effort to\
15:44\
develop\
15:45\
personal habits to study the gospel to\
15:47\
learn more about heavenly father\
15:49\
and jesus christ and to seek\
15:53\
and respond to personal revelation\
16:00\
during these perilous times of which the\
16:02\
apostle paul prophesied\
16:05\
satan is no longer even trying to hide\
16:08\
his attacks on god's plan\
16:12\
emboldened evil abounds\
16:16\
therefore the only way to\
16:19\
survive spiritually is to be determined\
16:22\
to let god prevail in our lives\
16:26\
to learn to hear his voice and to use\
16:29\
our energy to help gather\
16:34\
israel\
16:37\
now how does the lord feel about people\
16:40\
who will let god prevail\
16:44\
nephi summed it up well\
16:47\
the lord loveth those who will have him\
16:50\
to be their god\
16:53\
behold he loved our fathers and he\
16:56\
covenanted with them yea\
16:59\
even abraham isaac and jacob\
17:03\
and he remembers the covenants\
17:06\
which he has made close quote\
17:11\
and what is the lord willing to do for\
17:14\
israel\
17:16\
the lord has pledged that he will fight\
17:19\
our battles\
17:21\
and our children's battles and our\
17:24\
children's\
17:24\
children's battles to the third\
17:27\
and fourth generation\
17:33\
as you study your scriptures during the\
17:35\
next six months i encourage you to make\
17:37\
a list of all that the lord has promised\
17:39\
he will do\
17:40\
for covenant israel i think you will be\
17:44\
astounded\
17:46\
ponder these promises talk about them\
17:49\
with your family and friends\
17:52\
then live and watch for these promises\
17:55\
to be fulfilled\
17:56\
in your own life\
18:03\
my dear brothers and sisters as you\
18:06\
choose to let god prevail in your lives\
18:09\
you will experience for yourselves\
18:12\
that our god is a god\
18:15\
of miracles\
18:18\
as a people we are his covenant children\
18:23\
and we will be called\
18:27\
by his name\
18:31\
of this i testify in the sacred name of\
18:34\
jesus christ\
18:40\
amen\
18:41\
[Music]\
18:51\
you\
