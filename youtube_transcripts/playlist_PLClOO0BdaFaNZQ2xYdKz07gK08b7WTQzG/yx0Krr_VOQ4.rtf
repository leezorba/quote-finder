my dear brothers and sisters\
0:04\
during the last week of his mortal\
0:06\
ministry\
0:07\
jesus taught his disciples\
0:10\
to watch ye therefore and pray always\
0:14\
that ye may be accounted worthy to\
0:16\
escape all these things\
0:18\
that shall come to pass and to stand\
0:22\
before the son of man among the things\
0:26\
that shall\
0:27\
come to pass before his second coming\
0:30\
are wars and rumors of wars\
0:33\
famines and pestilences and earthquakes\
0:37\
and diverse places\
0:39\
in the doctrine and covenants the savior\
0:41\
said\
0:43\
and all things shall be in commotion\
0:46\
for fear shall come upon all people\
0:50\
certainly we live in a time during which\
0:53\
things\
0:54\
are in commotion many people fear the\
0:58\
future\
0:59\
and many hearts have turned away from\
1:01\
their faith in god\
1:03\
and his son jesus christ\
1:07\
news reports are filled with accounts of\
1:09\
violence\
1:11\
moral denigration has published online\
1:16\
cemeteries churches mosques synagogues\
1:19\
and religious shrines have been\
1:21\
vandalized\
1:23\
a global pandemic has reached virtually\
1:26\
every corner of the earth\
1:28\
millions of people have been infected\
1:30\
over\
1:32\
and millions have done a million have\
1:33\
died\
1:35\
school graduations church worship\
1:38\
services marriages missionary service\
1:42\
and a host of other\
1:44\
important life events have been\
1:46\
disrupted\
1:48\
additionally countless people have been\
1:51\
left alone\
1:52\
and isolated economic upheavals have\
1:56\
caused challenges for so many\
1:58\
especially for the most vulnerable of\
2:01\
our heavenly father's children\
2:03\
we have seen people passionately\
2:05\
exercising their right to peaceful\
2:08\
protest\
2:10\
and we have seen angry mobs riot\
2:13\
at the same time we continue to see\
2:16\
conflicts all around the world\
2:19\
i think often of those of you who are\
2:21\
suffering\
2:22\
worried afraid or feeling alone\
2:25\
i assure each one of you that the lord\
2:27\
knows you\
2:28\
that he is aware of your concern and\
2:31\
anguish\
2:32\
and that he loves you intimately\
2:35\
personally deeply and forever\
2:39\
each night when i pray i ask the lord to\
2:42\
bless\
2:43\
all who are burdened with grief pain\
2:45\
loneliness and sadness\
2:48\
i know that other church leaders echo\
2:50\
the same prayer\
2:52\
our hearts individually and collectively\
2:56\
go out to you and our prayers\
2:59\
go to god in your behalf\
3:02\
i spent several days last year in the\
3:05\
northeastern part of the united states\
3:08\
visiting american and church history\
3:10\
sites\
3:11\
attending meetings with our missionaries\
3:14\
and our members\
3:15\
and visiting government and business\
3:18\
leaders\
3:19\
on sunday october 20th i spoke to a\
3:23\
large gathering near boston\
3:25\
massachusetts\
3:27\
as i was speaking i was prompted to say\
3:31\
i plead with you to pray for this\
3:34\
country\
3:35\
for our leaders for our people and for\
3:38\
the families that live in this great\
3:41\
nation\
3:42\
founded by god i also said\
3:46\
that america and many of the nations of\
3:49\
the earth\
3:50\
as in times past are at another\
3:53\
critical crossroads and need our prayers\
3:58\
my plea was not in\
4:01\
my prepared remarks those words came to\
4:05\
me\
4:06\
as i felt the spirit prompt me to invite\
4:09\
those present to pray for their\
4:12\
countries\
4:13\
and their leaders today i expand my call\
4:17\
for prayer to all people\
4:19\
from every country around the world\
4:22\
no matter how you pray or to whom you\
4:24\
pray\
4:26\
please exercise your faith whatever your\
4:28\
faith may be\
4:30\
and pray for your country and for your\
4:33\
national leaders\
4:35\
as i said last october in massachusetts\
4:39\
we stand today at a major crossroads in\
4:42\
history\
4:43\
and the nations of the earth are in\
4:46\
desperate need of divine\
4:48\
inspiration and guidance\
4:51\
this is not about politics or policy\
4:55\
this is about peace and the healing that\
4:58\
can come\
4:58\
into individual souls as well as the\
5:02\
soul of countries\
5:04\
their cities towns and villages through\
5:07\
the prince of peace\
5:09\
and the source of all healing the lord\
5:12\
jesus christ\
5:14\
during the past few months i have had\
5:16\
the impression come to me\
5:19\
that the best way to help the current\
5:21\
world situation\
5:23\
is for all people to rely more fully\
5:25\
upon god\
5:27\
and to turn their hearts to him through\
5:29\
sincere prayer\
5:31\
humbling ourselves and seeking heaven's\
5:34\
inspiration\
5:35\
to endure or conquer what is before us\
5:39\
will be our safest and surest way\
5:42\
to move confidently forward through\
5:45\
these troubling times\
5:48\
the scriptures highlight prayers offered\
5:50\
by\
5:51\
jesus as well as his teachings about\
5:54\
prayer\
5:55\
during his mortal ministry you will\
5:58\
remember\
5:59\
the lord's prayer our father\
6:02\
which art in heaven hallowed be thy name\
6:07\
thy kingdom come thy will be done\
6:11\
as it is in heaven give us this day\
6:15\
our daily bread and forgive us\
6:18\
our debts as we forgive our debtors\
6:22\
and lead us not into temptation\
6:26\
but deliver us from evil for thine\
6:29\
is the kingdom and the power and the\
6:33\
glory forever\
6:34\
amen this focused\
6:37\
beautiful prayer repeated often\
6:40\
throughout christianity\
6:42\
makes it clear that it is appropriate to\
6:45\
directly petition\
6:48\
our father which art in heaven\
6:51\
for answers to what is troubling us\
6:55\
therefore let us pray for divine\
6:57\
guidance\
6:58\
i invite you to pray always pray for\
7:01\
your family\
7:02\
pray for your leaders of nations pray\
7:04\
for the courageous people who are at the\
7:06\
front lines\
7:08\
in this current battle against social\
7:10\
environmental political and biological\
7:13\
plagues\
7:14\
that impact the people throughout the\
7:17\
world\
7:18\
the rich and the poor the young\
7:22\
and the old the savior taught us\
7:26\
to not limit who we pray for he said\
7:29\
love your\
7:29\
enemies bless them that curse you\
7:32\
do good to them that hate you and pray\
7:35\
for them\
7:36\
which despitefully use you and persecute\
7:39\
you\
7:41\
on the cross of calvary where jesus\
7:44\
died for our sins he practiced what he\
7:47\
taught\
7:48\
when he prayed father forgive them\
7:52\
for they know not what they do\
7:56\
sincerely praying for those who may have\
7:59\
be considered our enemies\
8:01\
demonstrates our belief that god can\
8:04\
change our hearts\
8:05\
and the hearts of others such prayers\
8:09\
should strengthen our resolve\
8:11\
to make whatever changes are necessary\
8:14\
in our own lives\
8:15\
families and communities no matter where\
8:19\
you live\
8:20\
what language you speak or the\
8:22\
challenges you face\
8:24\
guard god hears and answers you\
8:27\
in his own way and in his own time\
8:31\
because we are his children we can\
8:34\
approach him\
8:35\
to seek help soulless and a renewed\
8:38\
desire to make a positive difference in\
8:41\
the world\
8:43\
praying for justice peace the poor and\
8:47\
the sick\
8:48\
is often not enough after we kneel in\
8:51\
prayer\
8:53\
we need to get up from our knees and do\
8:55\
what we can to help\
8:58\
those both of ourselves and\
9:01\
as we help others the scriptures are\
9:05\
full of examples of people of faith\
9:08\
who combine prayer with action to make a\
9:11\
difference\
9:12\
in their own lives and in the lives of\
9:14\
others\
9:16\
in the book of mormon for example we\
9:18\
read about enos\
9:20\
it has been observed that about\
9:22\
two-thirds of his short book\
9:25\
describes a prayer or a series of\
9:28\
prayers\
9:30\
and the balance tells what he did in\
9:32\
consequence\
9:34\
of the answers he received\
9:37\
we have many examples of how prayer\
9:41\
made a difference in our own church\
9:43\
history\
9:44\
beginning with joseph smith's first\
9:47\
vocal prayer\
9:48\
in a wooded clearing there his parents\
9:52\
log home\
9:52\
in the spring of 1820 seeking\
9:56\
forgiveness\
9:57\
and spiritual direction joseph\
10:01\
prayer opened the heavens today we are\
10:05\
the beneficiaries of joseph the prophet\
10:08\
and other faithful latter-day saint men\
10:11\
and women\
10:12\
who have prayed and acted to help\
10:15\
establish the church of jesus christ\
10:19\
of latter-day saints i often think of\
10:22\
the prayers of\
10:23\
faithful women like mary fielding smith\
10:27\
who with god's help courageously led her\
10:29\
family\
10:31\
from mounting persecution in illinois\
10:35\
to safety in the valley where her family\
10:39\
prospered spiritually\
10:41\
and temporally temporally after praying\
10:45\
earnestly on her knees she then worked\
10:48\
hard\
10:49\
to overcome her challenges and bless her\
10:52\
family\
10:54\
prayer with prayer will lift us and draw\
10:57\
us together as individuals\
11:00\
and families as a church and as\
11:04\
a world prayer will influence scientists\
11:09\
and help them toward discoveries of\
11:11\
vaccines\
11:13\
and medications that will end this\
11:15\
pandemic\
11:17\
prayer will comfort those who have lost\
11:20\
a loved one\
11:22\
it will guide us in knowing what to do\
11:25\
for our\
11:25\
own personal protection brothers and\
11:29\
sisters\
11:30\
i urge you to redouble your commitment\
11:33\
to prayer\
11:34\
i urge you to pray in your closets\
11:38\
in your daily walk in your homes\
11:41\
in your wards and always in your hearts\
11:46\
on behalf of the leaders of the church\
11:48\
of jesus christ of latter-day saints\
11:51\
i thank you for your prayers for us\
11:54\
i urge you to continue to pray that we\
11:58\
may receive\
11:58\
the inspiration and revelation to guide\
12:02\
the church through these difficult times\
12:05\
prayer can change our own lives\
12:09\
motivated by sincere prayer we can\
12:12\
improve and help others to do the same\
12:17\
i know the power of prayer by my own\
12:19\
experience\
12:21\
recently i was alone in my office\
12:24\
i had just gone through a medical\
12:26\
procedure on my hand\
12:28\
it was black and blue swollen and it was\
12:31\
painful\
12:33\
as i said at my desk i could not focus\
12:37\
on the important critical matters\
12:40\
because i was distracted by this pain\
12:44\
i knelt in prayer and asked the lord to\
12:47\
help me\
12:48\
focus so that i could accomplish my work\
12:52\
i stood and returned to the pile of\
12:55\
papers on my desk\
12:57\
almost immediately clarity and focus\
13:00\
came to my mind\
13:02\
and i was able to complete the pressing\
13:05\
matters before me\
13:08\
the world's current chaotic situation\
13:11\
may seem daunting as we consider the\
13:14\
multitude of issues and challenges\
13:17\
but it's my fervent testimony that if we\
13:20\
will pray\
13:22\
and ask heavenly father for needed\
13:24\
blessings and guidance\
13:26\
we will come to know how we can bless\
13:29\
our families\
13:31\
neighbors communities and even the\
13:33\
countries in which we live\
13:36\
the savior prayed and then he went about\
13:39\
doing good\
13:40\
by feeding the poor providing courage\
13:44\
and support to those in need\
13:46\
and reaching out in love forgiveness\
13:50\
peace and rest to all who would come\
13:53\
unto him\
13:55\
he continues to reach out to us\
13:59\
i invite all church members as well as\
14:01\
our neighbors and friends\
14:03\
of other faith groups worldwide to do as\
14:07\
the savior counsel his disciples\
14:10\
watch ye therefore and pray always\
14:14\
for peace for comfort\
14:17\
for safety and for the opportunities to\
14:20\
serve one another\
14:21\
how great is the power of prayer\
14:25\
and our and how needed are our prayers\
14:29\
and faith\
14:30\
in god and his beloved son in the world\
14:33\
today\
14:35\
let us remember and appreciate the power\
14:38\
of prayer\
14:40\
in the name of jesus christ\
14:56\
amen\
15:00\
you\
