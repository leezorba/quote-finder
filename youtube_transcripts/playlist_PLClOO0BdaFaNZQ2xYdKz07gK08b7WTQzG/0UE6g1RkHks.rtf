my dear brothers and sisters\
0:04\
what a joy it is to be with you as we\
0:06\
begin the 190th semi-annual general\
0:09\
conference\
0:10\
of the church of jesus christ of\
0:12\
latter-day saints\
0:14\
i love joining with you in your homes or\
0:17\
wherever you are\
0:19\
to listen together to the messages of\
0:21\
prophet seers and revelators\
0:23\
and other church leaders how grateful we\
0:27\
are\
0:27\
for the technology that allows us to be\
0:29\
connected as\
0:30\
one great worldwide gathering\
0:33\
of disciples of jesus christ\
0:38\
general conference last april was viewed\
0:40\
by more people\
0:41\
than any preceding it and we have every\
0:45\
expectation\
0:46\
that will happen again\
0:50\
during the past few months a global\
0:53\
pandemic\
0:55\
raging wildfires and other natural\
0:57\
disasters have turned\
0:59\
our world upside down\
1:03\
i grieve with each of you who has lost a\
1:07\
loved one during this time\
1:10\
and i pray for all who are currently\
1:14\
suffering\
1:17\
meanwhile the work of the lord is\
1:19\
steadily moving forward\
1:22\
amid social distancing face masks and\
1:25\
zoom meetings\
1:27\
we've learned to do some things\
1:29\
differently and some even more\
1:31\
effectively\
1:33\
unusual times can bring unusual\
1:38\
rewards our missionaries and mission\
1:41\
leaders have been resourceful resilient\
1:43\
and truly remarkable\
1:46\
although most missionaries have had to\
1:48\
find new\
1:49\
creative ways to do their work\
1:52\
many missions have reported doing more\
1:54\
teaching than ever\
1:58\
we had to close temples for a time and\
2:01\
some construction\
2:02\
projects were briefly delayed but now\
2:05\
they are\
2:06\
all moving forward\
2:10\
in the calendar year 2020\
2:13\
we will have broken ground for 20\
2:17\
new temples\
2:21\
family history work has increased\
2:23\
exponentially many new wards and stakes\
2:26\
have been created\
2:28\
and we are gratified to report that the\
2:30\
church has provided\
2:32\
pandemic humanitarian aid\
2:35\
for 895\
2:38\
projects in 150\
2:42\
countries\
2:47\
increased gospel study in many homes is\
2:49\
resulting in\
2:50\
stronger testimonies and family\
2:52\
relationships\
2:54\
one mother wrote we feel much closer to\
2:58\
our children and grandchildren\
3:00\
now that we gather on zoom every sunday\
3:03\
each takes a turn giving their thoughts\
3:05\
on come follow me\
3:08\
prayers for our family members have\
3:10\
changed because we better understand\
3:11\
what they need\
3:16\
i pray that we as a people are using\
3:19\
this\
3:19\
unique time to grow spiritually\
3:23\
we are here on earth to be tested\
3:27\
to see if we will choose to follow jesus\
3:29\
christ\
3:31\
to repent regularly to learn and to\
3:34\
progress\
3:35\
our spirits long to progress\
3:39\
and we do that best by staying firmly on\
3:41\
the covenant path\
3:45\
through it all our heavenly father and\
3:48\
his son jesus christ\
3:50\
love us they care for us\
3:54\
they and their holy angels are watching\
3:57\
over us\
3:58\
i know that is true\
4:02\
as we gather to hear the words the lord\
4:04\
has inspired his servants to deliver\
4:07\
i invite you to ponder a promise the\
4:10\
lord made\
4:11\
he declared that whosoever will\
4:17\
may lay hold upon the word of god which\
4:20\
is quick and powerful\
4:22\
which shall divide us under all the\
4:24\
cunning and the wiles of the devil\
4:27\
and lead the disciple of christ\
4:30\
in a straight and narrow course\
4:35\
i pray that you will choose to lay hold\
4:38\
upon the word of god\
4:39\
as it is declared during this general\
4:41\
conference\
4:42\
and i pray that you may feel the lord's\
4:45\
perfect love for you\
4:49\
in the sacred name of jesus christ amen\
5:06\
you\
