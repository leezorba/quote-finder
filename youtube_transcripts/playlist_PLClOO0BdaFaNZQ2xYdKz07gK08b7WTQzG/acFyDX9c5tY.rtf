while reading the book of mormon for a\
0:03\
come follow me lesson last summer\
0:05\
i was struck by alma's report that when\
0:08\
he became fully conscious of his sins\
0:11\
there was quote nothing so exquisite\
0:14\
and so bitter as were his pains\
0:18\
i confess talk of exquisite pain caught\
0:21\
my attention\
0:22\
partly due to my battle that week with a\
0:24\
seven millimeter kidney stone\
0:27\
never has one man experienced such great\
0:29\
things\
0:30\
when such a small and simple thing was\
0:33\
brought to pass\
0:36\
alma's language also stood out to me\
0:38\
because the word exquisite\
0:40\
in the english translation of the book\
0:42\
of mormon typically describes things of\
0:45\
exceptional beauty\
0:46\
or unparalleled magnificence for example\
0:50\
joseph smith noted that the angel moroni\
0:52\
wore robes of exquisite whiteness\
0:54\
a whiteness beyond anything earthly he\
0:57\
had ever\
0:58\
seen yet exquisite can also convey an\
1:01\
extreme intensity\
1:02\
even for awful things thus alma\
1:05\
and top dictionaries link exquisite pain\
1:08\
to being tormented\
1:09\
racked and harrowed to the greatest\
1:11\
degree\
1:13\
alma's imagery reflects the sobering\
1:15\
reality that at some point the full\
1:18\
excruciating guilt of every sin we\
1:21\
commit\
1:22\
must be felt justice demands it\
1:25\
and god himself cannot change it when\
1:28\
alma remembered\
1:29\
all his sins especially those that\
1:32\
destroyed the faith of others\
1:34\
his pain was virtually unbearable and\
1:37\
the idea of standing before god filled\
1:39\
him with inexpressible horror\
1:41\
he yearned to become extinct both soul\
1:44\
and body\
1:45\
however alma said everything started to\
1:49\
change the moment\
1:51\
his mind caught hold upon the prophesied\
1:54\
coming\
1:55\
of one jesus christ to atone for the\
1:58\
sins of the world\
1:59\
and he cried within his heart oh jesus\
2:02\
thou son of god have mercy on me\
2:05\
with that one thought and that one plea\
2:09\
alma was filled with exquisite joy\
2:13\
as exceeding as was his pain\
2:16\
we must never forget that the very\
2:19\
purpose of repentance\
2:21\
is to take certain misery and transform\
2:24\
it\
2:24\
into pure bliss thanks to his immediate\
2:28\
goodness\
2:29\
the instant we come unto christ\
2:31\
demonstrating faith in him and a true\
2:34\
change of heart\
2:35\
the crushing weight of our sins starts\
2:38\
to shift from our backs\
2:40\
to his this is only possible\
2:44\
because he without sin suffered the\
2:47\
infinite\
2:48\
and unspeakable agony of every single\
2:51\
sin\
2:51\
in the universe of his creations for all\
2:54\
of his creations\
2:56\
a suffering so severe blood\
2:59\
oozed out of his every pore\
3:03\
from direct personal experience the\
3:05\
savior thus warns us in modern scripture\
3:08\
that we have no idea how exquisite our\
3:11\
sufferings will be\
3:12\
if we do not repent but with\
3:15\
unfathomable generosity\
3:17\
he also clarifies that i god have\
3:21\
suffered these things for all\
3:23\
that they might not suffer if they would\
3:25\
repent\
3:27\
a repentance which allows us to taste\
3:30\
the exceeding joy alma tasted\
3:33\
for this doctrine alone i stand\
3:37\
all amazed yet astonishingly\
3:41\
christ offers even more\
3:44\
sometimes exquisite pain comes not from\
3:46\
sin but honest mistakes\
3:49\
the actions of others or forces beyond\
3:51\
our control\
3:53\
in these moments you may cry like the\
3:55\
righteous psalmist\
3:56\
my heart is sore pain within me and the\
3:58\
tears of death are fallen upon me\
4:01\
and horror hath overwhelmed me oh that i\
4:03\
had wings like a dove for then i would\
4:05\
fly away and be at rest\
4:08\
medical science professional counseling\
4:11\
or legal rectification\
4:13\
can help alleviate such suffering but\
4:15\
note\
4:16\
all good gifts including these come from\
4:20\
the savior\
4:22\
regardless of the causes of our worst\
4:24\
hurts and heartaches\
4:26\
the ultimate source of relief is the\
4:28\
same\
4:29\
jesus christ he alone\
4:32\
holds the full power and healing balm to\
4:35\
correct every mistake\
4:37\
right every wrong adjust every\
4:39\
imperfection\
4:41\
mend every wound and deliver every\
4:43\
delayed blessing\
4:44\
like witnesses of old i testify that we\
4:47\
have not in high priest\
4:49\
which cannot be touched with the feeling\
4:51\
of our infirmities\
4:52\
but rather a loving redeemer who\
4:55\
descended\
4:56\
from his throne above and went forth\
4:58\
suffering pains\
4:59\
and afflictions and temptations of every\
5:02\
kind\
5:03\
that he may know how to sucker his\
5:06\
people\
5:08\
for anyone today with pains so intense\
5:12\
or so unique that you feel no one else\
5:14\
could fully appreciate them\
5:16\
you may have a point there may be no\
5:20\
family member\
5:20\
friend or priesthood leader however\
5:23\
sensitive and well-meaning each may be\
5:25\
who knows exactly what you are feeling\
5:28\
or has the precise words to help you\
5:30\
heal\
5:31\
but know this there is one who\
5:34\
understands\
5:35\
perfectly what you are experiencing who\
5:38\
is mightier than all the earth and who\
5:40\
is able to do exceedingly abundantly\
5:42\
above all that you ask or think\
5:46\
the process will unfold in his way and\
5:48\
on his schedule\
5:50\
but christ stands ready always to heal\
5:53\
every ounce\
5:54\
and aspect of your agony\
5:57\
as you allow him to do so you will\
6:00\
discover your suffering was not in vain\
6:02\
speaking of many of the bible's greatest\
6:04\
heroes and their griefs\
6:06\
the apostle paul said that god provided\
6:09\
some better things for them through\
6:10\
their sufferings\
6:11\
for without sufferings they could not be\
6:13\
made perfect\
6:15\
you see the very nature of god\
6:18\
and aim of our earthly existence is\
6:21\
happiness\
6:22\
but we cannot become perfect beings of\
6:24\
divine joy\
6:26\
without experiences that test us\
6:28\
sometimes to our very\
6:30\
core paul says even the savior himself\
6:34\
was made eternally perfect or complete\
6:37\
through sufferings\
6:39\
so guard against the satanic whispering\
6:42\
that if you were a better person you\
6:44\
would avoid such trials\
6:46\
you must also resist the related lie\
6:49\
that your suffering somehow suggest you\
6:51\
stand outside the circle\
6:52\
of god's chosen ones who seem to glide\
6:56\
from one blessed state to another\
6:58\
instead\
7:00\
see yourself as john the revelator\
7:02\
surely saw you\
7:03\
in his majestic revelation of the latter\
7:06\
days\
7:07\
for john saw a great multitude which no\
7:10\
man could number\
7:11\
of all nations and kindreds and peoples\
7:14\
and tongue\
7:15\
tongues who stood before the throne and\
7:17\
before the lamb\
7:18\
clothed with white robes who cried with\
7:21\
a loud voice saying\
7:22\
salvation to our god when asked\
7:26\
what are these which are raid and white\
7:28\
robes and whence came they\
7:30\
john receives the answer these are they\
7:33\
which came out of great\
7:34\
tribulation and have washed their robes\
7:38\
and made them white in the blood of the\
7:40\
lamb\
7:42\
brothers and sisters suffering and\
7:45\
righteousness\
7:47\
helps qualify you for rather than\
7:50\
distinguishes you\
7:51\
from god's elect and it makes their\
7:54\
promises\
7:55\
your promises as john declares\
7:59\
you shall hunger no more neither thirst\
8:02\
anymore\
8:03\
neither shall the sun light on you nor\
8:06\
any heat\
8:07\
for the lamb which is in the midst of\
8:09\
the throne shall feed you\
8:11\
and shall lead you unto living fountains\
8:13\
of waters\
8:14\
and god shall wipe away all tears from\
8:18\
your eyes\
8:19\
and there shall be no more death neither\
8:22\
sorrow\
8:23\
nor crying neither shall there be any\
8:26\
more pain\
8:29\
i witness to you that through the\
8:32\
staggering goodness\
8:34\
of jesus christ and his infinite\
8:37\
atonement\
8:38\
we can escape the deserved agonies of\
8:41\
our moral failings\
8:43\
and overcome the undeserved agonies\
8:46\
of our mortal misfortunes under his\
8:50\
direction\
8:51\
your divine destiny will be one of\
8:54\
unparalleled magnificence\
8:56\
and indescribable joy a joy\
8:59\
so intense and so unique to you\
9:02\
your particular ashes will become\
9:05\
beauties\
9:06\
beyond anything earthly that you might\
9:09\
taste this happiness now\
9:12\
and be filled with it forever i invite\
9:14\
you to do what alma did\
9:16\
let your mind catch hold on the\
9:19\
exquisite gift\
9:21\
of the son of god as revealed through\
9:23\
his gospel\
9:25\
in this is true and living church in the\
9:28\
name of jesus christ\
9:34\
amen\
9:46\
you\
