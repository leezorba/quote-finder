my beloved brothers and sisters\
0:04\
we are all eager no one more than i\
0:08\
to hear concluding remarks from our\
0:09\
beloved prophet\
0:11\
president russell m nelson\
0:14\
this has been a a marvelous conference\
0:17\
but it's the second time\
0:19\
that covet 19 has altered our\
0:22\
traditional proceedings\
0:25\
we are so tired of this contagion that\
0:27\
we\
0:29\
feel like tearing our hair out\
0:32\
and apparently some of my brethren have\
0:34\
already begun that course of action\
0:37\
please know that we do pray constantly\
0:40\
for those who've been affected in any\
0:42\
way especially for any\
0:45\
who have lost loved ones everyone agrees\
0:49\
that this has gone on much much\
0:52\
too long how long\
0:57\
do we wait for relief from hardships\
1:01\
that come upon us\
1:04\
what about enduring personal trials\
1:08\
while we wait and wait and help\
1:12\
seem so slow in coming\
1:15\
why the delay when burdens seem\
1:19\
more than we can bear\
1:23\
while asking such questions we can if we\
1:26\
try\
1:28\
hear another's cry echoing from a dank\
1:32\
dark prison cell during one of the\
1:35\
coldest winters\
1:36\
then on record in that locale\
1:40\
oh god where art thou\
1:43\
we hear from the depths of liberty jail\
1:47\
and where is the pavilion that covert\
1:50\
thy hiding place\
1:52\
how long shall thy hand be stayed\
1:57\
how long o lord how long\
2:02\
so we're not the first\
2:05\
nor will we be the last to ask such\
2:08\
questions\
2:09\
when sorrows bear down on us or\
2:13\
an ache in our heart goes on and on\
2:17\
i'm not now speaking of pandemics or\
2:19\
prisons\
2:21\
but of you your family and your\
2:24\
neighbors\
2:26\
who face any number of such challenges\
2:30\
i speak of the yearning of many who\
2:32\
would like to be married\
2:33\
and aren't or who are married and wish\
2:36\
the relationship were a little more\
2:38\
celestial\
2:40\
i speak of those who have to deal with\
2:42\
the unwanted appearance\
2:44\
of a serious medical condition perhaps\
2:48\
an incurable one\
2:50\
or who face a lifelong battle with a\
2:52\
genetic defect\
2:54\
that has no remedy\
2:57\
i speak of the continuing struggle with\
2:59\
emotional\
3:01\
and mental health challenges that weigh\
3:04\
heavily on the souls of so many\
3:07\
who suffer with them and on the hearts\
3:09\
of those\
3:10\
who love and suffer with them\
3:13\
i speak of the poor whom the savior told\
3:16\
us\
3:17\
never to forget and i speak of you\
3:21\
waiting for the return of a child no\
3:24\
matter what the age\
3:26\
who has chosen a path different from the\
3:30\
one you prayed he or she would\
3:32\
take furthermore\
3:35\
i acknowledge that even this long list\
3:38\
of things for which we might wait\
3:39\
personally\
3:41\
does not attempt to address the large\
3:44\
economic\
3:45\
political and social concerns that\
3:48\
confront us collectively our father in\
3:51\
heaven clearly\
3:52\
expects us to address these wrenching\
3:55\
public issues as well as the personal\
3:58\
ones\
4:00\
but there will be times in our lives\
4:02\
when even\
4:03\
our best spiritual effort and earnest\
4:06\
pleading prayers\
4:08\
do not yield the victories for which we\
4:10\
have yearned\
4:12\
whether that be regarding the large\
4:14\
global matters\
4:15\
or the small personal ones\
4:19\
so while we work and wait together for\
4:21\
the answers to some of our prayers\
4:24\
i offer you my apostolic promise\
4:28\
that they are heard and they are\
4:30\
answered\
4:32\
though perhaps not at the time or\
4:35\
in the way that we wanted\
4:38\
but they are always answered at the\
4:42\
time and in the way that an\
4:45\
omniscient and eternally compassionate\
4:47\
parent compassionate parent\
4:50\
should answer them my beloved brothers\
4:54\
and sisters\
4:55\
please understand that he who never\
4:59\
sleeps nor slumbers\
5:01\
cares for the happiness and ultimate\
5:04\
exaltation of his children\
5:06\
above all else that a divine being has\
5:10\
to do\
5:12\
he is pure love gloriously personified\
5:17\
and merciful father is his name\
5:23\
well if this is the case you might say\
5:26\
shouldn't his love and mercy simply part\
5:29\
our personal red seas\
5:31\
and allow us to walk through our\
5:33\
troubles on dry ground\
5:36\
shouldn't he send 21st century seagulls\
5:39\
winging in from somewhere to gobble up\
5:42\
all of our pesky 21st century crickets\
5:46\
well the answer to such questions is yes\
5:49\
god can provide miracles instantaneously\
5:54\
but sooner or later we learn\
5:58\
that the times and seasons of our mortal\
6:00\
journey\
6:01\
are his and they are his\
6:04\
alone to direct\
6:08\
he administers that calendar to every\
6:11\
one of us\
6:12\
individually for every infirm man\
6:17\
healed instantly as he waits to enter\
6:20\
the pool of bethesda\
6:22\
someone else will spend 40 years in the\
6:25\
desert\
6:26\
waiting to enter the promised land\
6:30\
for every nephi and lehi divinely\
6:32\
protected by an encircling flame of fire\
6:36\
for their faith we have an abinadi\
6:40\
burned at a stake of flaming fire for\
6:42\
his\
6:45\
and we remember that the same elijah who\
6:48\
in an instant\
6:49\
called down fire from heaven to bear\
6:52\
witness against the priests of baal\
6:55\
is the same elijah who endured a period\
6:58\
when there was no rain\
7:00\
for years and who for a time\
7:04\
was fed only by the skimpy sustenance\
7:08\
that could be carried in a raven's claw\
7:11\
by my estimation that can't have been\
7:14\
anything we would call\
7:16\
a happy meal the point\
7:20\
the point is that faith means trusting\
7:24\
god\
7:24\
in good times and bad\
7:30\
even if that includes\
7:35\
some suffering until we see his arm\
7:39\
revealed in our behalf\
7:43\
that can be difficult in our modern\
7:46\
world\
7:47\
when many have come to believe that the\
7:49\
highest good in life\
7:51\
is to avoid all suffering that no one\
7:54\
should ever anguish\
7:55\
over anything but that belief\
7:59\
will never lead us to the measure of the\
8:02\
stature\
8:03\
of the fullness of christ\
8:06\
with apologies to elder neal a maxwell\
8:09\
for daring\
8:11\
to modify and enlarge something he once\
8:14\
said\
8:16\
i too suggest that one's life cannot be\
8:20\
both\
8:20\
faith-filled and stress-free\
8:25\
it simply will not work\
8:28\
to glide naively through life\
8:31\
saying as we sip another glass of\
8:33\
lemonade lord\
8:35\
give me all thy choicest virtues\
8:38\
but be certain not to give me grief nor\
8:41\
sorrow\
8:42\
nor pain or opposition please do not let\
8:46\
anyone dislike me\
8:47\
or betray me and above all\
8:51\
do not ever let me feel forsaken\
8:54\
by thee or those i love in fact lord\
8:59\
be careful to keep me from all the\
9:01\
experiences\
9:03\
that made thee divine and then when the\
9:07\
rough sledding by everyone else is over\
9:10\
please let me come and dwell with thee\
9:13\
where i can boast about how similar our\
9:16\
strengths and our\
9:17\
characters are as i float along on my\
9:21\
cloud of\
9:22\
comfortable christianity\
9:26\
my beloved brothers and sisters\
9:28\
christianity\
9:30\
is comforting but it is often\
9:34\
not comfortable the path to holiness\
9:38\
and happiness here and hereafter\
9:41\
is a long and sometimes rocky one\
9:45\
it takes time and tenacity\
9:48\
to walk it but of course the reward\
9:52\
for doing so is monumental\
9:57\
this truth is taught clearly and\
9:59\
persuasively\
10:01\
in the 32nd chapter of alma in the book\
10:03\
of mormon\
10:05\
there this great high priest teaches\
10:09\
that if the word of god is planted in\
10:11\
our hearts\
10:12\
as a mere seed and if we\
10:15\
care enough to water\
10:18\
weed nourish and encourage it\
10:22\
it will in the future bear fruit\
10:27\
which is most precious sweet above all\
10:31\
it is sweet\
10:32\
the consuming of which leads to a\
10:34\
condition of no more thirst\
10:37\
and no more hunger\
10:40\
many lessons are taught in this\
10:42\
remarkable chapter\
10:45\
but central to them all is the axiom\
10:49\
that the seed has to be nourished\
10:53\
and we must wait for it to mature\
10:57\
we look forward with an eye of faith\
11:02\
to the fruit thereof the record says\
11:06\
our harvest alma quotes comes\
11:09\
by and by\
11:12\
little wonder that he concludes his\
11:14\
remarkable instruction\
11:16\
by repeating three times\
11:20\
a call for diligence and patience\
11:24\
in nurturing the word of god in our\
11:26\
hearts\
11:28\
waiting as he says with longsuffering\
11:33\
for the tree to bring forth fruit unto\
11:36\
you\
11:41\
covered in cancer\
11:44\
doubt and dismay\
11:48\
financial trouble and family trials\
11:53\
when will these burdens be lifted\
11:57\
well the answer is by and by\
12:03\
and whether that be a short period or a\
12:05\
long one\
12:07\
it is not always hours to say\
12:12\
but by the grace of god\
12:15\
the blessings will come to those who\
12:17\
hold fast\
12:19\
to the gospel of jesus christ\
12:22\
that issue was settled in a very private\
12:26\
garden\
12:28\
on a very public hill\
12:31\
in jerusalem long ago\
12:35\
as we now hear our beloved prophet close\
12:38\
this conference\
12:41\
may we remember as russell nelson has\
12:43\
demonstrated\
12:44\
all of his life that\
12:48\
those who wait upon the lord shall renew\
12:52\
their strength\
12:55\
and shall mount up with wings as eagles\
13:02\
they shall run\
13:06\
and not be weary\
13:09\
they shall walk and not\
13:13\
faint i pray\
13:17\
that by and by sooner or later\
13:21\
these blessings will come\
13:24\
to every one of you who seeks relief\
13:28\
from your sorrow and freedom\
13:33\
from your grief i bear witness\
13:37\
of god's love and of the restoration of\
13:41\
his glorious gospel\
13:44\
which is in one way or another\
13:48\
the answer to every issue\
13:51\
we face in life\
13:55\
in the redeeming name of the lord jesus\
13:58\
christ\
14:00\
amen\
14:18\
you\
