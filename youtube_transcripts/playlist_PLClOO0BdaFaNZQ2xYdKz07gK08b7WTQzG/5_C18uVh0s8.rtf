my dear brothers and sisters\
0:03\
i am grateful to speak with you today\
0:08\
my hope is to give encouragement when\
0:11\
life seems\
0:12\
especially difficult and uncertain for\
0:16\
some of you\
0:17\
that time is now if not\
0:21\
such a time will come that is not a\
0:24\
gloomy view\
0:26\
it is realistic yet optimistic\
0:30\
because of god's purpose in the creation\
0:33\
of this world\
0:35\
that purpose was to give his children\
0:38\
the opportunity to prove themselves\
0:42\
able and willing to choose the right\
0:45\
when it is hard in so\
0:48\
doing their natures would be changed\
0:52\
and they could become more like him\
0:56\
he knew that would require unshakeable\
0:59\
faith in him\
1:02\
much of what i know came from my family\
1:06\
when i was about eight years old my wise\
1:09\
mother\
1:09\
asked my brother and me to full we\
1:12\
pull weeds with her in our family's\
1:15\
backyard garden\
1:18\
now that seems a simple task but we\
1:21\
lived\
1:21\
in new jersey it rained often\
1:26\
the soil was heavy clay\
1:29\
the weeds grew faster than the\
1:31\
vegetables\
1:33\
i remember my frustration when the\
1:36\
weeds broke off in my hands their\
1:39\
roots stuck firmly in the heavy mud\
1:43\
my mother and my brother were soon\
1:46\
far ahead in their rows the harder i\
1:50\
tried\
1:51\
the more i fell behind\
1:54\
this is too hard i cried out\
1:58\
instead of giving sympathy my mother\
2:01\
smiled\
2:02\
and said oh hal of course it's hard\
2:07\
it's supposed to be life is a test\
2:11\
in that moment i knew her words were\
2:14\
true\
2:14\
and would continue to be true in my\
2:17\
future\
2:18\
the reason for mother's loving smile\
2:20\
became clear\
2:22\
years later when i read of heavenly\
2:24\
father and his beloved son\
2:27\
speaking of their purpose in creating\
2:29\
the world\
2:30\
and giving spirit children the\
2:33\
opportunity\
2:34\
of mortal life and we will prove them\
2:37\
herewith\
2:39\
to see if they will do all things\
2:41\
whatsoever the lord their god shall\
2:43\
command them\
2:45\
and they who keep their first estate\
2:48\
shall be added upon and they who keep\
2:51\
not their first estate\
2:52\
shall not have glory in the same kingdom\
2:56\
with those who keep their first estate\
2:59\
and they would keep their say\
3:00\
and they who keep their second estate\
3:02\
shall have glory\
3:04\
added upon their heads forever and ever\
3:09\
you and i accepted that invitation to be\
3:12\
tested\
3:13\
and to prove that we would choose to\
3:16\
keep the commandments of god\
3:18\
when we would no longer be in the\
3:20\
presence\
3:21\
of our heavenly father\
3:25\
even with such a loving invitation\
3:28\
from our heavenly father lucifer\
3:31\
persuaded a third of the spirit children\
3:35\
to follow him and reject the father's\
3:38\
plan\
3:38\
for our growth and eternal happiness\
3:42\
for satan's rebellion he was cast out\
3:46\
with his followers now\
3:50\
he tries to cause as many as he can\
3:53\
to turn away from god during this\
3:57\
mortal life those of us who accepted the\
4:00\
plan did so because of our faith in\
4:03\
jesus christ who offered to become our\
4:06\
savior\
4:07\
and redeemer we must believe then\
4:11\
that whatever mortal weaknesses we would\
4:13\
have\
4:14\
and whatever evil forces would be\
4:16\
against us\
4:18\
the forces of good could be\
4:20\
overwhelmingly greater\
4:23\
heavenly father and jesus christ know\
4:27\
and love you they want you to return to\
4:30\
them\
4:31\
and become like them your success\
4:36\
is their success you have felt that love\
4:40\
confirmed by the holy ghost will you\
4:42\
have read or heard\
4:43\
these words open quote for behold\
4:47\
this is my work and my glory to bring to\
4:50\
pass the\
4:51\
immortality and eternal life of man\
4:56\
god has the power to make our way easier\
5:01\
he fed manna to the children of israel\
5:04\
in their wandering to the promised land\
5:08\
the lord and his mortal ministry healed\
5:11\
the sick\
5:12\
raised the dead and calmed the sea\
5:17\
after his resurrection he opened the\
5:19\
prison to them that were bound\
5:22\
yet the prophet joseph smith one of the\
5:25\
greatest of his prophets\
5:27\
suffered in prison and was taught the\
5:30\
lesson we all\
5:31\
profit from and need in our recurring\
5:35\
tests of faith open quote\
5:39\
and if thou shouldst be cast into the\
5:41\
pit\
5:42\
or into the hands of murderers and the\
5:45\
sentence of death passed upon thee\
5:47\
if thou be cast into the deep if the\
5:50\
billowing surge compile\
5:53\
conspire against the fierce winds become\
5:56\
thine enemy if the heavens gather\
5:58\
blackness\
6:00\
and all the elements combined to hedge\
6:02\
up the way\
6:03\
and above all if the very jaws of hell\
6:07\
shall gave open the mouth wide after\
6:09\
thee\
6:10\
know thou my son that all these things\
6:14\
shall give the experience and shall be\
6:17\
for thy good close quote\
6:21\
you might reasonably wonder why a loving\
6:24\
and all-powerful god\
6:25\
allows our mortal test to be so hard\
6:30\
it is because he knows that we must grow\
6:34\
in spiritual cleanliness and stature\
6:37\
to be able to live in his presence in\
6:40\
families forever\
6:42\
to make that possible heavenly father\
6:45\
gave us a savior\
6:47\
and the power to choose for ourselves by\
6:50\
faith\
6:51\
to keep his commandments and to repent\
6:54\
and so come unto him the father's plan\
6:58\
of happiness\
7:00\
has at its center our becoming ever\
7:03\
more like his beloved son\
7:06\
jesus christ in all things\
7:09\
the savior's example is our best guide\
7:14\
he was not exempt from the need to prove\
7:17\
himself\
7:18\
he endured for all of heavenly father's\
7:21\
children\
7:22\
paying the price for all our sins\
7:26\
he felt the suffering of all who have\
7:29\
and will come into mortality when you\
7:32\
wonder how much\
7:33\
pain you can endure well remember him\
7:37\
he suffered what you suffer so that he\
7:40\
would know\
7:41\
how to lift you up he may not remove the\
7:45\
burden\
7:45\
but he will give you strength comfort\
7:48\
and hope he knows the way\
7:52\
he drank the bitter cup he endured\
7:56\
the suffering of all you are being\
7:59\
nourished and comforted by a loving\
8:01\
savior\
8:03\
who knows how to sucker you in whatever\
8:06\
test you face\
8:07\
alma taught open quote and he shall go\
8:11\
forth suffering pains and afflictions\
8:13\
and temptations of every kind and this\
8:16\
that the word might be fulfilled\
8:18\
which saith he will take upon him the\
8:20\
pains and the sicknesses of his people\
8:24\
and he will take upon him death\
8:27\
that he may loose the bands of death\
8:29\
which blind his people\
8:31\
and he will take upon him their\
8:33\
infirmities\
8:34\
that his bowels may be filled with mercy\
8:38\
according to the flesh that he may know\
8:40\
according to the flesh\
8:42\
how to sucker his people according\
8:45\
to their infirmities close quote\
8:48\
one way he will sucker you will be to\
8:51\
invite you always to remember him\
8:55\
and to come unto him he has encouraged\
8:58\
us\
8:59\
this way open quote come unto me\
9:02\
all ye that labor and are heavy laden\
9:04\
and i will give you rest\
9:06\
take my yoke upon you and learn of me\
9:10\
for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye\
9:13\
shall find rest\
9:14\
unto your souls close quote\
9:18\
the way to come unto him is to feast\
9:21\
upon his words\
9:23\
to exercise faith under repentance\
9:26\
to choose to be baptized and confirmed\
9:29\
by his\
9:30\
authorized servant and then to keep your\
9:33\
covenants with god\
9:36\
he sends the holy ghost to be your\
9:37\
companion\
9:39\
comforter and god as you live worthy of\
9:43\
the gift of the holy ghost\
9:46\
the lord can direct you to safety even\
9:49\
when you cannot see the way\
9:51\
for me he has most often shown the next\
9:54\
step\
9:55\
or two to take rarely has he given me a\
9:58\
glimpse\
9:59\
of the distant future but even those\
10:02\
infrequent glimpses guide what i choose\
10:05\
to do\
10:06\
in daily life the lord explained\
10:10\
open quote you cannot behold with your\
10:13\
natural\
10:14\
eyes for the present time the design\
10:18\
of your god concerning those things\
10:20\
which will come hereafter\
10:23\
and the glory which will follow much\
10:25\
tribulation\
10:27\
for after much tribulation\
10:30\
come the blessings the greatest\
10:34\
blessing that will come when we prove\
10:37\
ourselves faithful to our covenant\
10:38\
during our trials\
10:40\
will be a change in our natures\
10:44\
by choosing to keep our covenants the\
10:47\
power\
10:47\
of jesus christ and the blessings of his\
10:49\
atonement can work in us\
10:52\
our hearts can be softened to love\
10:56\
to forgive and to invite others to come\
10:59\
unto\
11:00\
the savior our confidence in the lord\
11:03\
increases\
11:05\
our fears decrease now\
11:09\
even with such blessings promised\
11:11\
through tribulation\
11:13\
we do not seek tribulation in the mortal\
11:16\
experience we will have ample\
11:18\
opportunity to prove ourselves\
11:21\
to pass tests hard enough to become\
11:25\
ever more like the savior and our\
11:27\
heavenly father\
11:30\
in addition we must notice the\
11:33\
tribulation of others\
11:35\
and try to help that will be especially\
11:39\
hard\
11:40\
when we are being sorely tested\
11:42\
ourselves\
11:44\
but we will discover as we lift\
11:47\
another's burden\
11:49\
even a little that our backs are\
11:52\
strengthened\
11:53\
and we sense a light in the darkness\
11:57\
in this the lord is our exemplar\
12:00\
on the cross of gologartha having\
12:03\
already suffered pain so great\
12:06\
that he would have died were he not the\
12:08\
begotten son of god\
12:10\
he looked on his executioners and said\
12:13\
to his father\
12:15\
forgive them for they know not what they\
12:17\
do\
12:20\
while suffering for all who had ever\
12:22\
lived\
12:23\
he looked from the cross on john\
12:26\
and on his own sorry mother and\
12:29\
ministered to her\
12:31\
in her trial when jesus therefore saw\
12:35\
his mother\
12:36\
and the disciples standing by whom he\
12:38\
loves\
12:39\
he saith unto his mother woman\
12:42\
behold thy son then saith he to the\
12:46\
disciple\
12:47\
behold thy mother and from that hour\
12:50\
that disciple took her unto\
12:53\
his own home by his actions\
12:57\
on that most sacred of days he\
13:00\
voluntarily gave his life\
13:02\
for each of us offering not only sucker\
13:05\
in this life\
13:07\
but eternal life in the time to come\
13:11\
i have seen people rise to great heights\
13:13\
through proving\
13:14\
faithful in terrible trials\
13:17\
across the day the church today are\
13:20\
examples\
13:21\
people are driven to their knees by\
13:23\
adversity\
13:25\
by their faithful endurance and effort\
13:28\
they become\
13:29\
ever more like the savior and our\
13:32\
heavenly father\
13:35\
i learned another lesson from my mother\
13:38\
as a girl she had diphtheria and nearly\
13:41\
died\
13:43\
later she had spinal meningitis\
13:46\
her father died young and so my mother\
13:49\
and her brothers\
13:51\
helped support their mother all her life\
13:55\
she felt the effects of the trials of\
13:57\
illness\
13:59\
in her last 10 years of life she\
14:01\
required multiple operations\
14:04\
but through it all she proved faithful\
14:07\
to the lord\
14:09\
the only picture on her bedroom wall was\
14:12\
of the savior\
14:15\
her last words to me and her deathbed\
14:19\
were these hal you sound as if you are\
14:23\
getting a cold\
14:24\
why don't you take care of yourself\
14:28\
at her funeral the last speaker was\
14:30\
elder spencer w\
14:32\
kimball after saying something of her\
14:34\
trials and her faithfulness\
14:36\
he said essentially this some of you may\
14:39\
wonder why mildred\
14:41\
had to suffer so much and so long i will\
14:44\
tell you why\
14:46\
it was because the lord wanted to polish\
14:48\
her\
14:49\
a little more close quote\
14:52\
i express my gratitude for the many\
14:55\
faithful members of the church of jesus\
14:57\
christ\
14:58\
who bear burdens with steady faith and\
15:01\
who help\
15:02\
others to bear theirs as the lord\
15:06\
seeks to polish them a little more\
15:09\
i have also expressed love and\
15:11\
admiration for caregivers\
15:13\
and leaders across the world who serve\
15:15\
others while they\
15:17\
and their families endure such\
15:20\
polishing i testify\
15:24\
that we are children of a heavenly\
15:27\
father who loves us\
15:29\
i feel president russell m nelson's love\
15:32\
for us all\
15:34\
he is the lord's prophet in the world\
15:36\
today\
15:37\
i so testify in the sacred name\
15:41\
of the lord jesus christ amen\
15:59\
you\
