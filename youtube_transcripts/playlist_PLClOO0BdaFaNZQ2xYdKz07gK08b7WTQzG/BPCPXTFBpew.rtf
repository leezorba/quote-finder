gordon's mother told him if he would\
0:03\
finish his chores she would make him a\
0:04\
pie\
0:05\
his favorite kind just for him so gordon\
0:08\
went to work on getting those chores\
0:09\
done\
0:10\
and his mother rolled out the pie his\
0:12\
older sister kathy came into the house\
0:14\
with a friend\
0:15\
she saw the pie and she asked if she and\
0:16\
her friend could have a slice\
0:18\
no gordon said it's my pie mom baked it\
0:21\
for me and i had to earn it\
0:23\
kathy snapped at her little brother he\
0:24\
was so self-centered and ungenerous\
0:27\
how could he keep this all to himself\
0:30\
hours later when kathy opened the car\
0:32\
door to take her friend home\
0:34\
there on the seat were two napkins\
0:35\
folded nicely\
0:37\
two forks set on top and two wide pieces\
0:39\
of pie on plates\
0:41\
kathy told this story at gordon's\
0:43\
funeral to show that he was willing to\
0:45\
change\
0:45\
and show kindness to those who didn't\
0:47\
always deserve it\
0:49\
in 1842 the saints were working hard to\
0:52\
build the nauvoo temple\
0:54\
after the founding of the relief society\
0:56\
in march the prophet joseph often came\
0:58\
to their meetings\
0:59\
to prepare them for the unifying\
1:01\
covenants that they would soon be making\
1:02\
in the temple\
1:04\
on june 9th the prophet said he was\
1:06\
going to preach mercy\
1:08\
supposing that jesus christ and the\
1:10\
angels should object to us on frivolous\
1:12\
things\
1:13\
what would become of us we must be\
1:16\
merciful and overlook small things\
1:19\
president smith continued it grieves me\
1:21\
that there is no fuller fellowship\
1:23\
if one member suffer all feel it\
1:26\
by union of feeling we obtain power with\
1:29\
god\
1:30\
that small sentence struck me like\
1:33\
lightning\
1:34\
by union of feeling we obtain power with\
1:37\
god\
1:39\
this world isn't what i want it to be\
1:42\
there are many things that i want to\
1:44\
influence and make better\
1:46\
and frankly there's a lot of opposition\
1:48\
to what i hope for\
1:49\
and sometimes i feel powerless lately\
1:52\
i've been asking myself searching\
1:54\
questions how can i\
1:56\
understand people around me better how\
1:58\
will i create that union of feeling when\
2:01\
everybody's so different\
2:02\
what power from god might i access if\
2:05\
i'm just a little bit more unified with\
2:07\
others\
2:08\
from my soul searching i have three\
2:10\
suggestions and maybe they'll help you\
2:11\
too\
2:12\
the first one is have mercy\
2:15\
jacob 2 17 reads think of your brothers\
2:18\
and sisters like unto yourselves\
2:20\
and be familiar with all and free with\
2:23\
your substance\
2:24\
that they may be rich like unto you\
2:27\
let's replace the word substance with\
2:29\
mercy\
2:30\
be free with your mercy that they may be\
2:32\
rich like unto you\
2:34\
we often think of substance in terms of\
2:37\
food or money\
2:38\
but perhaps what we all need more of in\
2:40\
our ministering is mercy\
2:42\
my own relief society president recently\
2:44\
said the thing i promise you\
2:46\
is that i will keep your name safe i\
2:49\
will see you for who you are at your\
2:50\
best\
2:51\
i will never say anything about you that\
2:53\
is unkind that's not going to lift you\
2:56\
i ask you to do the same for me because\
2:58\
i'm terrified frankly of letting you\
3:00\
down\
3:02\
joseph smith told the sisters on that\
3:04\
june day in 1842\
3:06\
when persons manifest the least kindness\
3:09\
and love to me\
3:10\
oh what power it has over my mind the\
3:13\
nearer we get to our heavenly father\
3:15\
the more we are disposed to look with\
3:17\
compassion on perishing souls\
3:20\
we feel that we want to take them upon\
3:21\
our shoulders and cast their sins behind\
3:23\
our back\
3:25\
my talk is intended for all this society\
3:27\
if you would have god have mercy on you\
3:31\
have mercy on one another now this was\
3:33\
counsel specifically to the relief\
3:35\
society\
3:36\
so let's not judge each other let's not\
3:39\
let our words bite\
3:41\
let's keep each other's names safe and\
3:43\
give the gift of mercy\
3:45\
the second thing make your boat swing\
3:49\
in 1936 an obscure rowing team from the\
3:52\
university of washington\
3:53\
traveled to germany to participate in\
3:55\
the olympic games\
3:57\
it was the depths of the great\
3:58\
depression and these were working-class\
4:00\
boys\
4:01\
whose small mining and lumber towns\
4:03\
donated little bits of money so they\
4:05\
could travel to berlin\
4:07\
every aspect of the competition seemed\
4:09\
stacked against them\
4:10\
but something happened in the race in\
4:13\
the rowing world\
4:14\
they call it swing listen to this\
4:17\
description that's based on the book the\
4:18\
boys in the boat\
4:20\
there's a thing that sometimes happens\
4:22\
that is hard to achieve\
4:24\
and hard to define it's called swing\
4:27\
it happens only when all are rowing in\
4:29\
such perfect unison\
4:31\
that not a single action is out of sync\
4:34\
rowers must reign in their fierce\
4:36\
independence and at the same time hold\
4:38\
true to their individual capabilities\
4:40\
races are not won by clones good crews\
4:44\
are good blends\
4:45\
someone to lead the charge someone to\
4:48\
hold something in reserve\
4:49\
someone to fight the fight someone to\
4:51\
make peace\
4:53\
no rower is more valuable than another\
4:55\
all are assets to the boat\
4:57\
but if they are to row well together\
4:59\
each must adjust to the needs and\
5:01\
capabilities of the others\
5:03\
the shorter armed person reaching a\
5:05\
little farther\
5:06\
the longer armed person pulling in just\
5:08\
a bit\
5:09\
differences can be turned to advantage\
5:11\
instead of disadvantage\
5:13\
only then will it feel as if the boat is\
5:15\
moving on its own\
5:17\
only then does pain entirely give way to\
5:20\
exaltation\
5:22\
good swing feels like poetry\
5:25\
against towering obstacles this team\
5:27\
found perfect swing\
5:29\
and won the olympic gold was\
5:31\
exhilarating\
5:32\
but the unity that each rower\
5:34\
experienced that day was a holy moment\
5:36\
that stayed with them their whole lives\
5:39\
the third thing clear away the bad as\
5:42\
fast as the good can grow\
5:44\
in the beautiful allegory in jacob five\
5:46\
the lord of the vineyard planted a good\
5:48\
tree in good ground\
5:50\
but it became corrupted over time and\
5:52\
brought forth wild fruit\
5:53\
the lord of the vineyards says eight\
5:55\
times it grieveth me to lose this tree\
5:59\
the servant says to the lord of the\
6:00\
vineyard spare the tree a little longer\
6:03\
and the lord said yea i will spare it a\
6:05\
little longer\
6:06\
and then comes instruction that can be\
6:08\
applied to all of us\
6:09\
trying to dig about and find good fruit\
6:11\
in our own little vineyards\
6:13\
ye shall clear away the bad according as\
6:16\
the good shall grow\
6:18\
unity doesn't magically happen it takes\
6:20\
work\
6:21\
it's messy sometimes it's uncomfortable\
6:24\
and it happens gradually when we clear\
6:26\
away the bad as fast as the good can\
6:28\
grow\
6:30\
we're never alone in our efforts to\
6:31\
create unity\
6:33\
jacob five continues the servants did go\
6:36\
and labor with their mites and the lord\
6:38\
of the vineyard labored also with them\
6:41\
each of us is going to have deeply\
6:43\
wounding experiences\
6:45\
things that should never happen each of\
6:47\
us will also at various times allow\
6:50\
pride and loftiness to corrupt the fruit\
6:52\
we bear\
6:53\
jesus christ is our savior in all things\
6:56\
his power reaches to the very bottom\
6:59\
and is reliably there for us when we\
7:01\
call on him\
7:03\
we all beg for mercy for our sins and\
7:05\
failures\
7:06\
he freely gives it he asks us\
7:09\
if we can give that same mercy and\
7:11\
understanding to each other\
7:13\
jesus put it bluntly be one and if you\
7:16\
are not one you are not mine\
7:18\
but if we are one if we can spare a\
7:21\
piece of our pie\
7:22\
or fit our individual talent so that the\
7:25\
boat can swing in perfect unison\
7:27\
then we are his and he will help clear\
7:30\
away the bad as fast as the good does\
7:32\
grow\
7:33\
we may not yet be where we want to be\
7:36\
and we are not now where we will be\
7:38\
i believe the change we seek in\
7:40\
ourselves and in the groups we belong to\
7:42\
will come less by activism and more by\
7:46\
actively trying every day to understand\
7:48\
one another\
7:49\
why we're building zion a people of one\
7:53\
heart and one mind\
7:55\
as covenant women we have broad\
7:58\
influence\
7:59\
that influence is applied in everyday\
8:01\
moments when we're studying with a\
8:02\
friend or putting little kids to bed\
8:05\
or talking to a seat mate on the bus or\
8:07\
preparing a presentation with a\
8:08\
colleague\
8:09\
we have power to remove prejudice\
8:12\
and build unity relief society and young\
8:16\
women aren't just classes\
8:18\
they can also be unforgettable\
8:20\
experiences where very different women\
8:23\
all get in the same boat and row until\
8:25\
we find our swing\
8:27\
i offer this invitation be part of a\
8:30\
collective force that changes the world\
8:32\
for good\
8:34\
our covenantal assignment is to minister\
8:37\
to lift up the hands that hang down\
8:39\
to put struggling people on our backs or\
8:41\
in our arms and carry them\
8:43\
it isn't complicated to know what to do\
8:45\
but it often goes against our selfish\
8:47\
interests and we have to try\
8:50\
the women of this church have unlimited\
8:52\
potential to change society\
8:54\
i have full spiritual confidence that as\
8:57\
we seek union of feeling\
8:59\
we will call down the power of god to\
9:01\
make our efforts\
9:02\
whole when the church commemorated the\
9:05\
1978 revelation on priesthood\
9:07\
president russell m nelson extended a\
9:09\
powerful prophetic blessing\
9:11\
it is my prayer he said and blessing\
9:15\
that i leave upon all who are listening\
9:17\
that we may overcome\
9:19\
any burdens of prejudice and walk\
9:21\
uprightly with god\
9:22\
and with one another in perfect peace\
9:25\
and harmony\
9:27\
may we draw on this prophetic blessing\
9:29\
and use\
9:30\
our individual and collective efforts to\
9:32\
increase\
9:33\
unity in the world i leave my testimony\
9:37\
in the words of the lord jesus christ\
9:39\
humble timeless prayer that they all\
9:42\
may be one as thou father art in me\
9:45\
and i in thee that they also may be one\
9:48\
in us\
9:49\
in the name of jesus christ amen\
10:06\
you\
