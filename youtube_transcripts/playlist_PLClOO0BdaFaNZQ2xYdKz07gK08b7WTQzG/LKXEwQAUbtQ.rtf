prior to travel restrictions\
0:03\
caused by the current pandemic i was\
0:06\
returning home from an international\
0:08\
assignment\
0:08\
which due to scheduling issues created a\
0:11\
sunday layover\
0:13\
i had time between flights to attend a\
0:15\
local sacrament meeting\
0:16\
where i was able also able to share a\
0:18\
brief message\
0:20\
following the meeting an enthusiastic\
0:22\
deacon approached me and\
0:23\
asked if i knew president nelson and if\
0:26\
i had ever had a chance to shake his\
0:28\
hand\
0:30\
i answered that i did know him that i\
0:32\
had shaken his hand\
0:34\
and that as a member of the presiding\
0:35\
bishopric i had the opportunity to meet\
0:38\
with president nelson and his counselors\
0:40\
a couple of times each week well the\
0:43\
young deacon then sat down on a chair\
0:45\
threw his hands in the air and shouted\
0:47\
this is the greatest day of my life\
0:51\
well brothers and sisters i may not\
0:53\
throw my hands in the air and shout\
0:55\
but i am eternally grateful for a living\
0:57\
prophet and for the direction we receive\
1:00\
from prophets seers and revelators\
1:02\
especially\
1:03\
during these times of challenge from the\
1:06\
beginning of time\
1:07\
the lord has provided direction to help\
1:09\
his people\
1:10\
prepare spiritually and temporally\
1:13\
against the calamities and trials that\
1:14\
he knows will come\
1:16\
as part of this mortal experience these\
1:19\
calamities may be personal\
1:21\
or general in nature but the lord's\
1:23\
guidance will provide protection and\
1:25\
support\
1:26\
to the extent that we heed and act upon\
1:29\
his counsel\
1:30\
a wonderful example is provided in an\
1:33\
account from the book of genesis\
1:35\
where we learn of joseph in egypt and\
1:37\
his inspired interpretation\
1:39\
of pharaoh's dream we read\
1:42\
and joseph said unto pharaoh god hath\
1:45\
showed pharaoh what he is about to do\
1:48\
behold there comes seven years of great\
1:50\
plenty\
1:51\
throughout all the land of egypt and\
1:53\
there shall arise after them\
1:54\
seven years of famine and all the plenty\
1:57\
shall be forgotten\
1:58\
in the land of egypt pharaoh listened to\
2:02\
jesus to joseph\
2:03\
responded to what god had showed him in\
2:05\
a dream and immediately set about\
2:07\
preparing\
2:08\
for what was to come the scriptures then\
2:11\
record\
2:12\
and in the seven plenteous years the\
2:14\
earth brought forth by handfuls\
2:17\
and he gathered up all the food of the\
2:19\
seven years\
2:20\
and joseph gathered corn as the sand of\
2:22\
the sea\
2:24\
until he left numbering for it was\
2:26\
without\
2:27\
number once the seven years of plenty\
2:30\
had passed\
2:31\
we are told that seven years of dearth\
2:33\
began to come\
2:34\
according as joseph had said and the\
2:37\
dearth was in\
2:37\
all lands but in all the lands of egypt\
2:41\
there was bread today we are blessed to\
2:44\
be led by prophets who\
2:46\
understand the need for us to prepare\
2:48\
against the calamities\
2:50\
which should come and who also recognize\
2:53\
the limitations or restrictions that we\
2:56\
may encounter\
2:56\
in striving to follow their counsel\
2:59\
there is a clear understanding\
3:01\
that the effects of covet 19 as well as\
3:04\
devastating natural disasters\
3:06\
are no respecter of persons and cross\
3:09\
ethnic\
3:10\
social and religious boundaries on every\
3:12\
continent\
3:14\
jobs have been lost and incomes reduced\
3:17\
as the opportunity to work has been\
3:19\
affected by layoffs\
3:20\
and the ability to work has been\
3:22\
impacted by health and legal challenges\
3:26\
to all who have been affected we express\
3:29\
understanding\
3:30\
and concern for your situation as well\
3:32\
as a firm conviction\
3:34\
that better days are ahead you have been\
3:37\
blessed with bishops and branch\
3:38\
presidents\
3:39\
who seek out members of their\
3:41\
congregations who have temporal needs\
3:43\
and these leaders have access to tools\
3:45\
and resources\
3:46\
that can help you re-establish your\
3:48\
lives and place you on the path of\
3:51\
self-reliance\
3:52\
as you apply principles of preparedness\
3:56\
in today's environment with a pandemic\
3:58\
that has devastated whole economies\
4:01\
as well as individual lives it would be\
4:03\
inconsistent\
4:04\
with a compassionate savior to ignore\
4:07\
the reality\
4:08\
that many are struggling and ask them\
4:11\
to begin building a reserve of food and\
4:13\
money for the future\
4:15\
however that does not mean that we\
4:17\
should permanently ignore principles of\
4:19\
preparation\
4:21\
only that these principles should be\
4:23\
applied in wisdom\
4:24\
and order so that in the future\
4:27\
we might say as did joseph in egypt\
4:30\
there was bread the lord does not expect\
4:34\
us\
4:34\
to do more than we can do but he does\
4:37\
expect us\
4:38\
to do what we can do when we can do it\
4:42\
as president nelson reminded us in our\
4:44\
last general conference\
4:45\
the lord loves effort\
4:48\
church leaders have often encouraged\
4:50\
latter-day saints\
4:51\
to prepare for adversity in life by\
4:54\
having a basic supply of food\
4:56\
and water and some money in savings at\
4:59\
the same time\
5:00\
we are encouraged to be wise and not to\
5:02\
go to extremes\
5:04\
in our efforts to establish a home\
5:06\
storage supply\
5:07\
and a financial reserve a resource\
5:10\
entitled personal finances for\
5:12\
self-reliance\
5:14\
published in 2017 and currently\
5:17\
available on the church website in 36\
5:19\
languages\
5:20\
begins with a message from the first\
5:22\
presidency which states\
5:25\
the lord has declared it is my purpose\
5:27\
to provide for my saints\
5:29\
this revelation is a promise from the\
5:31\
lord that he will provide\
5:33\
temporal blessings and open the door of\
5:35\
self-reliance\
5:37\
accepting and living these principles\
5:39\
will better enable you to receive the\
5:41\
temporal blessings promised by the lord\
5:44\
we invite you to diligently study and\
5:47\
apply these principles\
5:49\
and teach them to your family members as\
5:51\
you do so\
5:52\
your life will be blessed because you\
5:55\
are a child of our father in heaven\
5:57\
he loves you and will never forsake you\
6:00\
he knows you\
6:01\
and is ready to extend to you the\
6:04\
spiritual and temporal blessings\
6:06\
of self-reliance\
6:09\
this resource includes chapters devoted\
6:12\
to creating and living within a budget\
6:15\
protecting your family against hardship\
6:17\
managing a financial crisis\
6:19\
investing for the future and many more\
6:22\
and is available for\
6:23\
everyone on the church website or\
6:25\
through your local leaders\
6:28\
when considering the principle of\
6:30\
preparedness we can look back to joseph\
6:32\
in egypt for inspiration\
6:34\
knowing what would happen would not have\
6:36\
been sufficient to carry them through\
6:38\
the lean years\
6:39\
without a degree of sacrifice during the\
6:42\
years of abundance\
6:44\
rather than consume all that pharaoh's\
6:46\
subjects could produce\
6:48\
limits were established and followed\
6:51\
providing sufficient for their immediate\
6:53\
as well as their future needs it was not\
6:56\
enough to know that challenging times\
6:58\
would come\
6:59\
they had to act and because of their\
7:02\
effort\
7:03\
there was bread so this leads to an\
7:06\
important question\
7:07\
therefore what well a good place to\
7:10\
begin is to understand\
7:12\
that all things are spiritual to the\
7:13\
lord and not at any time has he given us\
7:16\
a law\
7:17\
which was temporal everything then\
7:19\
points to jesus christ\
7:21\
is the foundation upon which we must\
7:23\
build even our temporal preparedness\
7:27\
being temporarily prepared and\
7:29\
self-reliant means believing that\
7:31\
through the grace or enabling power of\
7:33\
jesus christ\
7:34\
and our own effort we are able to obtain\
7:38\
all the spiritual and temporal\
7:39\
necessities of life\
7:41\
we require for ourselves and our\
7:43\
families\
7:44\
additional aspects of a spiritual\
7:46\
foundation for\
7:47\
temporal preparedness includes acting in\
7:50\
wisdom and order\
7:52\
which implies a gradual buildup of food\
7:54\
storage and savings\
7:55\
over time as well as embracing\
7:58\
small and simple means which is a\
8:01\
demonstration of faith\
8:03\
that the lord will magnify our small but\
8:05\
consistent efforts\
8:08\
with a spiritual foundation in place we\
8:10\
can then successfully apply\
8:12\
two important elements of temporal\
8:14\
preparedness\
8:15\
managing finances and home storage\
8:18\
key principles to manage your finances\
8:21\
includes the payment of tithes and\
8:22\
offerings\
8:23\
eliminating and avoiding debt preparing\
8:26\
and living within a budget\
8:28\
and saving for the future key home\
8:30\
storage principles\
8:32\
includes the storage of food the storage\
8:34\
of water\
8:35\
as well as other necessities based on\
8:37\
individual and family needs\
8:40\
all because the best storehouse is the\
8:42\
home\
8:43\
which becomes the most accessible\
8:45\
reserve in times of need\
8:48\
as we embrace the spiritual principles\
8:51\
and seek inspiration from the lord\
8:53\
we will be guided to know the lord's\
8:55\
will for us\
8:56\
individually and as families and how\
8:59\
best to apply the important principles\
9:01\
of temporal preparedness the most\
9:04\
important step of all\
9:06\
is to begin elder bednar taught this\
9:09\
principle when he said\
9:10\
taking action is the exercise of faith\
9:13\
true faith\
9:14\
is focused in and on the lord jesus\
9:16\
christ\
9:17\
and always leads to action\
9:20\
brothers and sisters in an ever-changing\
9:23\
world\
9:24\
we must prepare for uncertainties even\
9:26\
with better days ahead\
9:28\
we know that the temporal peaks and\
9:30\
valleys of mortality\
9:31\
will continue as we seek to become\
9:34\
temporally prepared we can face the\
9:37\
trials of life\
9:38\
with increased confidence peace in our\
9:40\
hearts\
9:41\
and like joseph in egypt we will be able\
9:44\
to say\
9:45\
even in stressful circumstances there\
9:47\
was bread\
9:49\
in the name of jesus christ amen\
10:07\
you\
