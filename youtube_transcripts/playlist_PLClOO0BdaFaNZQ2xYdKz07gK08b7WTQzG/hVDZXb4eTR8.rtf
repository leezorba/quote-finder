the prophet joseph smith was taught that\
1:33\
the works\
1:34\
and the designs and the purposes of god\
1:37\
cannot be frustrated neither can they\
1:40\
come to naught\
1:43\

1:45\
these great assurances\
1:48\
behold this is the promise of the lord\
1:51\
unto you\
1:52\

1:56\

2:08\
of the living god\
2:11\

2:19\

2:27\
for after much tribulation come the\
2:29\
blessings\
2:32\

2:35\
given in the midst of persecutions\
2:38\
and personal tragedies apply to\
2:41\
each of you in your troubling\
2:43\
circumstances today\
2:46\
they are precious to remind each of us\
2:48\
to be of good cheer\
2:50\
and to have joy in the fullness of the\
2:53\
gospel\
2:54\
as we press forward through the\
2:56\
challenges of mortality\
3:00\
tribulation and challenges are the\
3:02\
common experiences of mortality\
3:05\
opposition is an essential plan\
3:08\
is an essential part of the divine plan\
3:11\
for helping us\
3:12\
grow and in the midst of that process\
3:15\
we have god's assurance that in the long\
3:18\
view\
3:21\
of eternity opposition will not be\
3:24\
allowed\
3:25\
to overcome us with his help\
3:29\
and our faithfulness and endurance we\
3:31\
will\
3:32\
prevail\
3:35\
like the mortal life of which they are\
3:36\
apart all tribulations\
3:39\
are temporary in the controversies\
3:42\
that preceded a disastrous war\
3:46\
united states president abraham lincoln\
3:48\
wisely remanded his audience\
3:51\
of the ancient wisdom that this\
3:54\
too shall pass away\
3:58\
as you know the mortal adversities of\
4:00\
which i speak\
4:02\
which make it difficult to be of good\
4:04\
cheer\
4:06\
sometimes come to us in common with many\
4:08\
others\
4:10\
like the millions now struggling through\
4:12\
some of the many devastating effects of\
4:14\
the covet 19 pandemic\
4:17\
similarly in the united states\
4:20\
millions are suffering through a season\
4:22\
of enmity and contention\
4:25\
that always seems to accompany\
4:27\
presidential elections\
4:29\
but this time is the most severe many of\
4:31\
the oldest of us can ever remember\
4:35\
on a personal basis each of us struggles\
4:38\
individually with some of the many\
4:40\
adversities of mortality\
4:43\
such as poverty racism ill health\
4:47\
job losses or disappointments wayward\
4:50\
children\
4:50\
bad marriages or no marriages and the\
4:53\
effects of sin\
4:54\
our own or others yet in the midst of\
4:58\
all of this\
4:59\
we have that heavenly council to be of\
5:02\
good cheer\
5:03\
and to find joy in the principles and\
5:06\
promises\
5:06\
of the gospel and the fruits of our\
5:09\
labors\
5:11\
that council has always been so for\
5:14\
prophets\
5:15\
and for all of us we know this from the\
5:18\
experiences of our predecessors\
5:20\
and what the lord said to them remember\
5:24\
the circumstances of the prophet joseph\
5:26\
smith\
5:28\
looked at through the lens of\
5:30\
adversities\
5:31\
his life was one of poverty persecution\
5:36\
frustration family sorrows and\
5:39\
ultimate martyrdom as he suffered\
5:42\
imprisonment his wife and children and\
5:44\
the other saints\
5:46\
suffered incredible hardships as they\
5:48\
were driven out of missouri\
5:50\
when joseph pleaded for relief the lord\
5:53\
answered\
5:54\
my son peace be unto thy soul\
5:58\
thine adversity and thine affliction\
6:00\
shall be but a small moment\
6:03\
and then if thou endure it well god\
6:06\
shall exalt thee on high\
6:09\
thou shalt triumph over all thy foes\
6:15\
this was the personal eternal counsel\
6:17\
that helped the prophet joseph to\
6:20\
maintain his native cheery temperament\
6:23\
and the love and loyalty of his people\
6:26\
these same qualities strengthened the\
6:28\
leaders and pioneers who followed\
6:30\
and can strengthen you as well\
6:34\
think of those early members again and\
6:37\
again they were driven from place to\
6:39\
place\
6:40\
finally they faced the challenges of\
6:42\
establishing their homes\
6:45\
and the church in a wilderness\
6:48\
two years after the initial band of\
6:51\
pioneers arrived in the valley of the\
6:52\
great salt lake\
6:54\
the pioneer's grip on survival in that\
6:58\
hostile area was still precarious\
7:02\
most members were still on the trail\
7:04\
across the plains\
7:05\
or struggling to get resources to do so\
7:09\
yet leaders and members were still of\
7:13\
hope\
7:13\
and good cheer even though not settled\
7:16\
in their new homes\
7:18\
at october 1849\
7:22\
general conference a new wave of\
7:24\
missionaries was sent out\
7:26\
to scandinavia france germany\
7:30\
italy and the south pacific at what\
7:33\
could have been\
7:34\
thought their lowest level the pioneers\
7:38\
rose\
7:38\
to new heights and just three years\
7:42\
later\
7:43\
another 98 were also called to begin to\
7:46\
gather\
7:46\
scattered israel one of the church\
7:49\
leaders explained then\
7:51\
that these missions quote are generally\
7:53\
not to be very long ones\
7:56\
probably from three to seven years will\
7:58\
be as long as any man will be absent\
8:00\
from his family\
8:01\
end of quote sisters\
8:05\
the first presidency is concerned about\
8:08\
your challenges\
8:09\
we love you and pray for you\
8:12\
at the same time we often give thanks\
8:14\
that our physical challenges\
8:17\
apart from earthquakes fires floods and\
8:19\
hurricanes\
8:20\
are usually less than our predecessors\
8:23\
faced\
8:25\
in the midst of hardships the divine\
8:28\
assurance is\
8:29\
always be of good cheer for\
8:32\

8:35\
yours\
8:35\
and the blessings thereof are yours and\
8:38\
the riches of\
8:39\
eternity are yours\
8:42\
how does this happen how did it happen\
8:45\
for the pioneers\
8:47\
how will it happen to women of today\
8:52\
by following prophetic guidance\
8:56\
the lord has said to the women of today\
9:00\
the gates of hell shall not prevail\
9:02\
against us\
9:04\
the lord said by revelation in april\
9:06\
1830\
9:08\
yea he said the lord god will disperse\
9:12\
the powers of darkness from before you\
9:15\
and cause the heavens to shake for your\
9:17\
good\
9:18\
and his name's glory\
9:21\
fear not little flock do good\
9:24\
let earth and hell combine against you\
9:27\
for you\
9:28\
for if you are built upon my rock they\
9:31\
cannot prevail\
9:34\
with the lord's promises we lift up our\
9:37\
hearts and rejoice\
9:39\
and with a glad heart and a cheerful\
9:42\
countenance we go forward\
9:43\
on the covenant path most of us do not\
9:47\
face\
9:47\
decisions of giant proportions like\
9:50\
leaving our homes to pioneer an unknown\
9:53\
land\
9:54\
our decisions are mostly in the daily\
9:56\
routines of life\
9:58\
but as the lord has told us be not weary\
10:01\
in well-doing\
10:02\
for ye are found laying the foundation\
10:04\
of a great work\
10:06\
and out of small things proceedeth that\
10:10\
which is great\
10:12\
there's boundless power in the doctrine\
10:14\
of the restored gospel of jesus christ\
10:18\
our unshakeable faith in that doctrine\
10:20\
guides our steps\
10:22\
and gives us joy it enlightens our minds\
10:26\
and gives strength and confidence to our\
10:28\
actions\
10:30\
this guidance and enlightenment and\
10:32\
power are promised gifts we have\
10:34\
received from our heavenly father\
10:37\
by understanding and conforming our\
10:39\
lives to that doctrine\
10:41\
including the divine gift of repentance\
10:45\
we can be of good cheer\
10:48\
as we keep ourselves on the path toward\
10:51\
our eternal destiny\
10:52\
reunion and exaltation with our\
10:56\
loving heavenly parents\
