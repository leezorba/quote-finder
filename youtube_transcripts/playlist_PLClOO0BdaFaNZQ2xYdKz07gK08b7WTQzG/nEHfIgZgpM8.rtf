i love the old testament story of a\
0:03\
young man who served the prophet elisha\
0:06\
early one morning the young men woke up\
0:09\
went outside\
0:10\
and found the city surrounded by a great\
0:13\
army intent on destroying them he ran to\
0:16\
elisha\
0:18\
alas my master how shall we do\
0:21\
elisha answered fear not\
0:24\
for they that be with us are more than\
0:27\
they that be with them\
0:29\
knew the young man needed more than\
0:31\
calming reassurance\
0:33\
he needed vision and so elisha prayed\
0:37\
lord open his eyes that he may see\
0:40\
and the lord opened the eyes of the\
0:43\
young man\
0:44\
and he saw and behold the mountain was\
0:47\
full of horses and chariots of fire\
0:49\
round about elisha there may be times\
0:53\
when you\
0:54\
like the servant find yourself\
0:56\
struggling to see how god is working in\
0:58\
your life\
1:00\
times when you feel under siege when the\
1:03\
trials of mortality bring you to your\
1:05\
knees\
1:07\
wait and trust in god and in his timing\
1:11\
because you can trust his heart with all\
1:14\
of yours\
1:16\
but there is a second lesson here my\
1:18\
dear sisters and brothers\
1:20\
you too can pray for the lord to open\
1:23\
your eyes\
1:24\
to see things you would not normally see\
1:28\
perhaps the most important things for us\
1:30\
to see clearly\
1:32\
are who god is and who we really are\
1:36\
sons and daughters of heavenly parents\
1:38\
with the divine nature and eternal\
1:40\
destiny\
1:42\
ask god to reveal these truths to you\
1:45\
along with how he feels about you\
1:47\
the more you understand your true\
1:50\
identity and purpose\
1:51\
so deep the more it will influence\
1:54\
everything in your life\
1:57\
understanding how god sees us prepares\
2:00\
the way\
2:01\
to help us see others as he does\
2:04\
columnist david brooks said quote\
2:08\
many of our society's great problems\
2:11\
flow from people not feeling seen\
2:14\
and known there is a core trait that we\
2:18\
all have to get better at\
2:20\
and that is the trait of seeing each\
2:23\
other deeply\
2:24\
and being deeply seen end quote\
2:29\
jesus christ sees people deeply\
2:32\
he sees individuals their needs and who\
2:35\
they can become\
2:37\
where others saw fishermen sinners or\
2:39\
publicans\
2:40\
jesus saw disciples where others saw a\
2:44\
man possessed by devils\
2:46\
jesus looked past the outward distress\
2:49\
acknowledged him\
2:50\
and healed him even in our busy lives\
2:54\
we can follow the example of jesus and\
2:57\
see\
2:58\
individuals their needs their\
3:01\
faith their struggle and who they can\
3:04\
become\
3:06\
as i pray for the lord to open my eyes\
3:08\
to see things i might not normally see\
3:11\
i often ask myself two questions and pay\
3:14\
attention to the impressions that come\
3:17\
what am i doing that i should stop doing\
3:21\
and what am i not doing that i should\
3:24\
start doing\
3:26\
months ago during the sacrament i asked\
3:28\
myself these questions\
3:30\
and was surprised by the answer that\
3:31\
came stop\
3:33\
looking at your phone when you are\
3:35\
waiting in lines\
3:37\
looking at my phone in lines had become\
3:39\
almost automatic\
3:41\
i found it a good time to multitask to\
3:44\
catch up on email\
3:45\
look at headlines or scroll through a\
3:47\
social media feed\
3:49\
the next morning i found myself waiting\
3:51\
in a long line at the store\
3:53\
i pulled out my phone and then\
3:55\
remembered the impression i had received\
3:58\
i put my phone away and looked around\
4:01\
i saw an elderly gentleman in line ahead\
4:03\
of me\
4:04\
his cart was empty except for a few cans\
4:06\
of cat food\
4:08\
i felt a little awkward but i said\
4:10\
something really clever like\
4:12\
i can see you have a cat he said that a\
4:16\
storm was coming and he did not want to\
4:18\
be caught without cat food\
4:20\
we visited briefly and then he turned to\
4:22\
me and said\
4:24\
you know i haven't told anyone this but\
4:26\
today is my birthday\
4:29\
my heart melted i wished him a happy\
4:31\
birthday\
4:32\
and offered a silent prayer of thanks\
4:34\
that i had not been on my phone\
4:37\
and missed an opportunity to truly see\
4:39\
and connect\
4:40\
with another person who needed it with\
4:43\
all of my heart i do not want to be like\
4:45\
the priest or the levite\
4:47\
on the road to jericho one who looks and\
4:51\
passes by\
4:52\
but too often i think i am i recently\
4:56\
learned a valuable lesson about\
4:58\
seeing deeply from a young woman named\
5:00\
roslyn\
5:02\
the story was shared with me by my\
5:04\
friend who was devastated when her\
5:06\
husband of 20 years moved out\
5:09\
with her children splitting time between\
5:11\
parents the prospect of attending church\
5:14\
alone seemed daunting\
5:16\
she recounts in a church where the\
5:19\
family is of paramount importance\
5:21\
sitting solo can be painful that first\
5:24\
sunday i walked in\
5:26\
praying no one would speak to me i was\
5:28\
barely holding it together and tears\
5:30\
were on the brink\
5:32\
i sat in my typical spot hoping no one\
5:35\
would notice\
5:36\
how empty the bench seemed a young woman\
5:39\
in our ward turned and looked at me\
5:42\
i pretended to smile she smiled back\
5:45\
i could see the concern in her face i\
5:48\
silently pleaded that she wouldn't come\
5:50\
talk to me\
5:52\
i had nothing positive to say and knew i\
5:54\
would cry\
5:56\
i looked back down at my lap and avoided\
5:58\
eye contact\
6:01\
during the next hour i noticed her\
6:02\
looking back at me occasionally\
6:05\
as soon as the meeting ended she made a\
6:07\
beeline for me\
6:09\
hi roslyn i whispered she wrapped me in\
6:12\
her arms and said\
6:13\
sister smith i can tell today is a bad\
6:16\
day for you\
6:17\
i'm so sorry i love you\
6:21\
as predicted the tears came and she\
6:23\
hugged me again\
6:24\
but as i walked away i thought to myself\
6:28\
maybe i can do this after all that sweet\
6:31\
16 year old young woman less than half\
6:34\
my age\
6:35\
found me every sunday for the rest of\
6:37\
that year to give me a hug\
6:39\
and ask how are you it made such a\
6:42\
difference in how i felt about coming to\
6:44\
church\
6:45\
the truth is i started to rely on those\
6:47\
hugs\
6:48\
someone noticed me someone knew i was\
6:51\
there\
6:52\
someone cared end of quote\
6:56\
as with all gifts the father so\
6:58\
willingly offers\
6:59\
seeing deeply requires us to ask him\
7:02\
and then act ask to see others as he\
7:06\
does\
7:07\
his true sons and daughters with\
7:09\
infinite and divine potential\
7:11\
then act by loving serving and\
7:15\
affirming their worth and potential as\
7:17\
prompted\
7:18\
as this becomes the pattern of our lives\
7:21\
we will find\
7:22\
ourselves becoming true followers of\
7:24\
jesus christ\
7:26\
and others will be able to trust our\
7:29\
hearts\
7:30\
with theirs and in this pattern we will\
7:33\
also discover\
7:34\
our own true identity and purpose\
7:38\
my friend recalled another experience\
7:40\
while sitting in that same empty pew\
7:42\
alone wondering if 20 years of effort to\
7:46\
live the gospel in her home was all for\
7:48\
naught\
7:49\
she needed more than calming reassurance\
7:52\
she needed vision\
7:54\
she felt a question pierce her heart why\
7:57\
did you do those things\
7:59\
did you do them for the reward the\
8:01\
praise of others or the desired outcome\
8:05\
she hesitated for a moment searched her\
8:08\
heart\
8:08\
and was then able to answer confidently\
8:12\
i did them because i love the savior\
8:15\
and i love his gospel\
8:18\
the lord opened her eyes to help her see\
8:21\
this simple but powerful change of\
8:23\
vision helped her continue to press on\
8:26\
with faith in christ\
8:28\
despite her circumstances\
8:31\
i witness that jesus christ loves us\
8:35\
and can give us eyes to see even when\
8:38\
it's hard\
8:39\
even when we're tired even when we're\
8:42\
lonely\
8:43\
and even when the outcomes are not as we\
8:46\
hoped\
8:48\
through his grace he will bless us and\
8:51\
increase our\
8:53\
through the power of the holy ghost\
8:55\
christ will enable us\
8:57\
to see ourselves and see others as he\
9:00\
does\
9:01\
and with his help we can discern what is\
9:04\
most needful\
9:06\
we can begin to see the hand of the lord\
9:09\
working\
9:09\
in and through the ordinary details of\
9:12\
our lives\
9:14\
we will see deeply and then in that\
9:17\
great day\
9:18\
when he shall appear we shall be like\
9:20\
him for we shall see\
9:22\
him as he is that we may have this hope\
9:25\
is my prayer\
9:26\
in the name of jesus christ amen\
9:44\
you\
