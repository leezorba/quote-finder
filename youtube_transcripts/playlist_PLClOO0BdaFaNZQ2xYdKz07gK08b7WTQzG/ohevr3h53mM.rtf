0:28\
and broken-hearted wondering if their\
0:31\
lives\
0:32\
will ever be the same let me tell you\
0:35\
some personal story about brokenness\
0:38\
when our children were young they\
0:40\
decided they wanted to take piano\
0:41\
lessons\
0:42\
my husband rudy and i wanted to provide\
0:45\
our children\
0:46\
this opportunity but we had no piano\
0:49\
we could not afford a new piano so i\
0:51\
already started looking for\
0:53\
a used piano that year for christmas\
0:56\
he surprised us all with a piano\
1:00\
and through the years our children\
1:03\
learned to play\
1:05\
when our sons grew up and left the house\
1:07\
the old piano just\
1:09\
collected dust so we sold it\
1:12\
a few years went by and we had saved\
1:15\
some money\
1:16\
one day rudy said i think it's time to\
1:18\
get a new piano\
1:20\
i asked why would we get a new piano\
1:22\
when neither of us play he said\
1:26\
oh but he can we can get a piano that\
1:30\
plays itself\
1:32\
by using an ipad you can program the\
1:35\
piano to play over 4 000\
1:37\
songs including kim's tabernacle choir\
1:40\
songs\
1:41\
all the primary songs and so many more\
1:44\
well rudy is a great salesperson to say\
1:47\
the least\
1:49\
we purchased a beautiful new player\
1:51\
piano\
1:52\
and a few days later two big strong men\
1:55\
deliver it to our house i showed them\
1:58\
away\
1:59\
where i wanted it and move out of the\
2:01\
way it was a heavy baby grand\
2:04\
and to fit it through the door they\
2:06\
removed the legs and\
2:07\
managed to put the pianos sideways on\
2:10\
top of a moving dolly\
2:11\
that they had brought with them our\
2:14\
house sat on a little bit of a slope\
2:16\
and unfortunately earlier that day it\
2:19\
has snowed\
2:20\
leaving things wet and slushy can you\
2:23\
see where this\
2:24\
is going while moving the piano\
2:27\
up the little slope it slipped and i\
2:31\
heard a big loud crash the piano had\
2:34\
fallen off\
2:35\
the moving dolly and hit the ground so\
2:38\
hard\
2:38\
that he left a big dent in our lawn\
2:42\
i said oh my goodness are you okay\
2:45\
thankfully both men were okay their eyes\
2:49\
were wide as they look at each other and\
2:51\
then they looked at me\
2:53\
and said we are so sorry we'll take it\
2:56\
back\
2:56\
to the store and our manager will call\
2:58\
you\
3:00\
soon the manager was talking with rudy\
3:03\
to arrange delivery of a new piano\
3:06\
rudy is kind and forgiving and told the\
3:09\
manager\
3:10\
it was okay if they just repaired the\
3:13\
damage\
3:14\
and brought back the same piano but the\
3:16\
manager and sister\
3:18\
insisted that we would get a new one\
3:21\
rudy responded saying it couldn't be\
3:23\
that bad\
3:24\
just fix it up and bring it over\
3:27\
the manager said the wood is broken\
3:31\
and once the wood is broken it can never\
3:34\
sound the same you will get a new piano\
3:39\
sisters and brothers are and we all like\
3:42\
this piano\
3:43\
a little broken cracked and damaged\
3:47\
feeling like we will never be the same\
3:50\

3:51\

3:54\
by exercising faith in him repenting\
3:58\
and making and keeping covenants our\
4:01\

4:05\
this process which invites the savior's\
4:08\
healing power into our lives\
4:10\
does not just restore us to what we were\
4:13\

4:21\
