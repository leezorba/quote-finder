when our children were young our family\
0:03\
spent a few days at a beautiful lake\
0:06\
one afternoon some of the children put\
0:08\
on life jackets before jumping off a\
0:10\
deck\
0:10\
and into the water our youngest daughter\
0:13\
watched with hesitation\
0:15\
carefully observing her siblings then\
0:18\
with all the courage she could muster\
0:20\
she plugged her nose with one hand and\
0:22\
jumped\
0:24\
she immediately popped up and with a bit\
0:26\
of panic\
0:27\
in her voice yelled help me help me\
0:31\
now she was not in any mortal danger her\
0:34\
life jacket was doing its job and she\
0:36\
was floating safely\
0:38\
we could have reached out and pulled her\
0:40\
back on the deck with little effort\
0:42\
yet from her perspective she needed help\
0:46\
perhaps it was the chill of the water or\
0:48\
the newness of the experience\
0:51\
in any case she climbed back onto the\
0:53\
deck\
0:54\
where we wrapped her in a dry towel and\
0:56\
complimented her\
0:58\
on her bravery whether we are\
1:01\
old or young many of us have in moments\
1:04\
of distress uttered with urgency words\
1:07\
such as\
1:08\
help me save me or\
1:12\
please answer my prayer\
1:15\
such an event happened with jesus's\
1:17\
disciples during his mortal ministry\
1:20\
in mark we read that jesus began again\
1:23\
to teach by the seaside\
1:25\
and there was gathered unto him a great\
1:27\
multitude\
1:29\
the crowd became so numerous that jesus\
1:31\
entered into a ship\
1:32\
and spoke from its deck all day long he\
1:36\
taught the people in parables as they\
1:38\
sat on the shore\
1:40\
and when the evening was come he said\
1:42\
unto his disciples\
1:44\
let us pass over unto the other side and\
1:47\
when they had sent away the multitude\
1:49\
they departed from the shore and were on\
1:51\
their way across the sea of galilee\
1:55\
finding a spot in the back of the ship\
1:58\
jesus laid down and quickly fell asleep\
2:02\
soon there arose a great storm of wind\
2:06\
and the waves beat into the ship so that\
2:09\
it was\
2:09\
nearly full of water\
2:13\
many of jesus's disciples were\
2:15\
experienced fishermen\
2:16\
and knew how to handle a boat in a storm\
2:20\
they were his trusted indeed his beloved\
2:23\
disciples\
2:24\
they had left jobs personal interests\
2:26\
and family to follow jesus\
2:29\
their faith in him was evident by their\
2:32\
presence in the boat\
2:34\
and now their boat was in the middle of\
2:37\
a tempest\
2:38\
and on the very verge of sinking\
2:42\
we don't know how long they battled to\
2:44\
keep the boat afloat in the storm\
2:46\
but they woke jesus with a bit of panic\
2:49\
in their voices saying master\
2:53\
carest thou not that we perish lord\
2:56\
save us we perish they called him master\
3:00\
and that he is he is also jesus\
3:04\
christ the son of god the father of\
3:06\
heaven\
3:07\
and earth the creator of all things from\
3:10\
the beginning\
3:12\
from his position in the boat jesus\
3:16\
arose and rebuked the wind and said unto\
3:18\
the raging sea\
3:20\
peace be still and the wind did cease\
3:24\
and there was a great calm ever the\
3:27\
master teacher\
3:29\
jesus then taught his disciples through\
3:31\
two simple\
3:32\
yet loving questions he asked\
3:35\
why are ye so fearful where is your\
3:38\
faith\
3:40\
there is a mortal tendency even at\
3:43\
temptation when we find ourselves in the\
3:45\
middle of trials troubles or afflictions\
3:48\
to cry out master carest thou not that i\
3:51\
perish save me\
3:54\
even joseph smith pleaded from an awful\
3:56\
prison\
3:57\
oh god where art thou and where is the\
4:00\
pavilion that covert thy hiding place\
4:04\
certainly the savior of the world\
4:06\
understands our mortal limitations\
4:09\
for he teaches us how to feel peace\
4:12\
and calm even when the winds blow\
4:14\
fiercely around us\
4:16\
and billowing waves threaten to sink our\
4:19\
hopes\
4:21\
to those with proven faith child-like\
4:24\
faith\
4:24\
or even the smallest particle of faith\
4:27\
jesus invites saying come unto me\
4:32\
believe on my name learn of me\
4:35\
and listen to my words he tenderly\
4:38\
commands\
4:40\
repent and be baptized in my name\
4:43\
love one another as i have loved you and\
4:47\
always remember me\
4:50\
jesus reassures explaining these things\
4:53\
i have spoken unto you\
4:55\
that in me ye might have peace in the\
4:58\
world ye shall have tribulation\
5:00\
but be of good cheer i have overcome the\
5:04\
world\
5:05\
i can imagine that jesus's disciples in\
5:08\
the storm tossed boat were\
5:10\
of necessity busy watching the waves\
5:13\
crash onto their deck and bailing out\
5:15\
the water\
5:16\
i can picture them handling the sails\
5:19\
and trying to maintain\
5:20\
some semblance of control over their\
5:22\
little craft their focus\
5:24\
was on surviving the moment and their\
5:27\
plea for help was\
5:28\
urgently sincere many of us are no\
5:32\
different in our day\
5:33\
recent events around the globe and in\
5:35\
our nation's communities and families\
5:37\
have buffeted us with\
5:39\
unforeseen trials in times of turmoil\
5:42\
our faith can feel stretched to the\
5:44\
limits of our endurance and\
5:46\
understanding waves of fear can distract\
5:50\
us\
5:51\
causing us to forget god's goodness thus\
5:54\
leaving our perspective\
5:55\
short-sighted and out of focus yet it is\
5:59\
in these rough stretches of our journey\
6:02\
that our faith can be not only tried\
6:05\
but fortified regardless of our\
6:08\
circumstances\
6:09\
we can intentionally make efforts to\
6:11\
build and increase our faith in jesus\
6:14\
christ\
6:15\
it is strengthened when we remember that\
6:18\
we are children of god and that he\
6:20\
loves us our faith grows\
6:23\
as we experiment on the word of god with\
6:26\
hope and diligence\
6:28\
trying our very best to follow christ's\
6:30\
teachings\
6:32\
our faith increases as we choose to\
6:35\
believe\
6:36\
rather than doubt forgive rather than\
6:39\
judge\
6:40\
repent rather than rebel\
6:44\
our faith is refined as we patiently\
6:47\
rely\
6:48\
on the merits and mercy and grace of the\
6:51\
holy messiah\
6:53\
while faith is not a perfect knowledge\
6:55\
elder neil a maxwell said\
6:58\
it brings a deep trust in god whose\
7:00\
knowledge\
7:01\
is perfect even in turbulent times\
7:05\
faith in the lord jesus christ is gritty\
7:07\
and resilient\
7:09\
it helps us sift through unimportant\
7:11\
distractions\
7:12\
it encourages us to keep moving along\
7:15\
the covenant path\
7:17\
faith pushes through discouragement and\
7:20\
allows us to\
7:21\
face the future with resolve and squared\
7:24\
shoulders\
7:25\
it prompts us to ask for rescue and\
7:28\
relief as we pray to the\
7:30\
father in the name of his son\
7:33\
and when prayerful pleas seem to go\
7:36\
unanswered our persistent faith in jesus\
7:40\
christ\
7:41\
produces patience humility\
7:44\
and the ability to reverently utter the\
7:46\
words\
7:47\
thy will be done president russell m\
7:50\
nelson has taught\
7:52\
quote we do not need to let our fears\
7:55\
displace our faith we can combat those\
7:58\
fears by\
7:59\
strengthening our faith start with your\
8:02\
children\
8:03\
let them feel your faith even when sore\
8:06\
trials come upon you\
8:08\
let your faith be focused on your loving\
8:10\
heavenly father and his beloved\
8:12\
son the lord jesus christ teach\
8:15\
each precious boy or girl that he or she\
8:18\
is a child of god created in his image\
8:22\
with a sacred purpose and potential\
8:25\
each is born with challenges to overcome\
8:28\
and faith to be developed end quote\
8:33\
i recently heard two four-year-old\
8:35\
children\
8:36\
share their faith in jesus christ when\
8:38\
they responded to the question\
8:40\
how does jesus christ help you\
8:43\
the first child said i know jesus loves\
8:47\
me because he died for me\
8:49\
and he also loves grown-ups\
8:52\
the second child said he helps me when\
8:55\
i'm\
8:56\
sad or grumpy he also helps me\
9:00\
when i'm sinking\
9:03\
jesus declared therefore whoso repenteth\
9:06\
and cometh unto me\
9:08\
as a little child him will i receive for\
9:12\
of such\
9:12\
is the kingdom of god for god\
9:15\
so loved the world that he gave his only\
9:18\
begotten son\
9:20\
that whosoever believeth in him should\
9:22\
not perish\
9:24\
but have everlasting life\
9:27\
recently president nelson promised that\
9:30\
decreased fear\
9:31\
and increased faith will follow\
9:34\
as we begin anew truly to hear hearken\
9:37\
to\
9:38\
and heed the words of the savior\
9:41\
sisters and brothers our current\
9:44\
challenging circumstances are\
9:46\
not our final eternal destination\
9:49\
as members of the church of jesus christ\
9:51\
of latter-day saints\
9:53\
we have taken upon us the name of jesus\
9:55\
christ by covenant\
9:57\
we have faith in his redeeming power and\
10:00\
hope in his great and precious promises\
10:04\
we have every reason to rejoice for our\
10:08\
lord\
10:09\
and savior is keenly aware of our\
10:11\
troubles\
10:12\
cares and sorrows and\
10:16\
as jesus was with his disciples of old\
10:20\
he is in our boat i testify he has given\
10:24\
his life\
10:25\
so that you and i will not perish\
10:29\
may we trust him obey his commandments\
10:33\
and with faith hear him say\
10:36\
peace be still\
10:40\
in the sacred and holy name of jesus\
10:42\
christ\
10:44\
amen\
11:00\
you\
