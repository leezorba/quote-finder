i express my love for you\
0:03\
our beloved friends and fellow believers\
0:06\
i have admired your faith and courage\
0:08\
during these past months as this\
0:11\
worldwide pandemic\
0:13\
has disrupted our lives and taken\
0:15\
precious family members\
0:16\
and dear friends during this period of\
0:19\
uncertainty\
0:21\
i have felt an unusual gratitude\
0:24\
for my sure and certain knowledge that\
0:26\
jesus\
0:27\
is the christ have you felt that way\
0:31\
there are difficulties that weigh upon\
0:33\
each of us\
0:35\
but always before us is he\
0:38\
who humbly declared i am the way\
0:41\
the truth and the life while we endure a\
0:45\
season of physically distancing\
0:46\
ourselves from\
0:47\
others we need never endure\
0:50\
a season of spiritually distancing\
0:54\
ourselves from him who lovingly calls to\
0:58\
us come unto me\
1:01\
like a guiding star in a clear dark sky\
1:05\
jesus christ lights our way he came to\
1:08\
earth in a humble stable\
1:10\
he lived a perfect life he healed the\
1:13\
sick and raised the dead\
1:15\
he was a friend to the forgotten he\
1:17\
taught us to do good\
1:19\
to obey and to love one another\
1:22\
he was crucified on a cross rising\
1:25\
majestically three days later\
1:28\
allowing us and those we love to live\
1:30\
beyond the grave\
1:33\
with his incomparable mercy and grace he\
1:36\
took upon himself\
1:37\
our sins and our suffering bringing\
1:40\
forgiveness as we repent\
1:42\
and peace in the storms of life\
1:46\
we love him we worship him\
1:49\
we follow him he is the anchor\
1:52\
of our souls interestingly\
1:57\
while this spiritual conviction is\
1:59\
increasing within us\
2:01\
there are many on the earth who know\
2:03\
very little of jesus christ\
2:06\
and in some parts of the world where his\
2:08\
name has been proclaimed for centuries\
2:11\
faith in jesus christ is diminishing\
2:14\
the valiant saints in europe have seen\
2:16\
belief decline in their countries\
2:18\
through the decades\
2:20\
sadly here in the united states faith is\
2:23\
also receding\
2:25\
a recent study revealed that in the last\
2:28\
10 years\
2:29\
30 million people in the united states\
2:32\
have stepped away from believing in the\
2:34\
divinity of jesus christ\
2:37\
looking worldwide another study predicts\
2:40\
that in the decades ahead more than\
2:42\
twice as many will leave christianity\
2:45\
than those who will embrace it\
2:48\
we of course revere the ride of each to\
2:50\
choose\
2:52\
yet our heavenly father declared this\
2:56\
is my beloved son hear him\
3:00\
i witness that the day will come that\
3:03\
every knee will bow\
3:04\
and every tongue confess that jesus\
3:08\
is the christ how are we to respond to\
3:12\
our changing world\
3:14\
while some are neglecting their faith\
3:17\
others are searching for the truth\
3:20\
we have taken upon ourselves the name of\
3:22\
the savior\
3:24\
what more are we to do\
3:28\
part of our answer may come as we\
3:30\
remember\
3:31\
how the lord tutored president russell m\
3:34\
nelson\
3:35\
in the months prior to his call as\
3:37\
president of the church\
3:39\
speaking one year before his call\
3:42\
president nelson invited us\
3:44\
to more deeply study the 2200 references\
3:49\
of the name jesus christ listed in the\
3:52\
topical guide\
3:54\
three months later in april general\
3:56\
conference\
3:58\
he spoke of how even his in his decades\
4:01\
of devoted discipleship\
4:03\
this deeper study of jesus christ had\
4:07\
greatly affected him\
4:09\
sister wendy nelson asked him about its\
4:11\
impact\
4:12\
he replied i am a different man\
4:17\
he was a different man at age 92\
4:21\
a different man president nelson\
4:24\
explained\
4:26\
as we invest time in learning about the\
4:28\
savior\
4:29\
and his atoning sacrifice we are drawn\
4:32\
to him\
4:34\
our focus becomes riveted on the savior\
4:37\
and his gospel\
4:40\
the savior said look unto me in every\
4:43\
thought\
4:45\
in a world of work worries and worthy\
4:47\
endeavors\
4:49\
we keep our heart our mind and our\
4:51\
thoughts\
4:53\
on him who is our hope and salvation\
4:57\
if a renewed study of the savior helped\
5:00\
prepare\
5:00\
president nelson could it not help\
5:03\
prepare\
5:04\
us as well in\
5:07\
emphasizing the name of the church\
5:09\
president nelson taught\
5:12\
if we are to have access to the power of\
5:14\
the atonement of jesus christ\
5:17\
to cleanse and heal us to strengthen and\
5:20\
magnify us\
5:21\
and ultimately to exalt us we must\
5:25\
clearly acknowledge him\
5:27\
as the source of that power\
5:31\
president nelson taught us that\
5:32\
consistently using the correct name of\
5:35\
the church\
5:36\
something that might seem like a small\
5:38\
thing is not small at all\
5:40\
and will shape the world's future\
5:44\
i promise you that as you prepare\
5:47\
yourselves\
5:48\
as president nils president nelson did\
5:52\
you too will be different thinking more\
5:55\
about the savior\
5:57\
speaking of him more frequently and with\
5:59\
less hesitation\
6:00\
as you come to know and love him even\
6:03\
more deeply\
6:05\
your words will flow more comfortably as\
6:08\
they do when you speak of one of your\
6:10\
children\
6:11\
or of a dear friend those listening to\
6:14\
you\
6:15\
will feel less like debating or\
6:17\
dismissing you\
6:18\
and more like learning from you\
6:22\
you and i speak of jesus christ but\
6:26\
maybe we can do\
6:27\
a little better if the world is going to\
6:30\
speak less of him\
6:32\
who is going to speak more of him we are\
6:36\
along with other devoted christians\
6:40\
are there images of the savior in your\
6:42\
home in our homes\
6:44\
do we talk often to our children about\
6:46\
the parables of jesus\
6:48\
the stories of jesus are like a rushing\
6:52\
wind\
6:52\
across the embers of faith in the hearts\
6:55\
of our children\
6:57\
when your children ask you questions\
6:59\
consciously think about teaching what\
7:01\
the savior taught\
7:03\
for example if your child asks daddy why\
7:07\
do we pray\
7:08\
you might respond that's a great\
7:11\
question\
7:12\
do you remember when jesus prayed let's\
7:15\
talk about why he prayed\
7:17\
and how he prayed we talk of christ\
7:22\
we rejoice in christ that our children\
7:26\
may know\
7:27\
to what source they may look for a\
7:29\
remission\
7:30\
of their sins this same scripture adds\
7:34\
that we preach of christ\
7:37\
in our worship services let us focus on\
7:40\
the savior jesus christ\
7:42\
and the gift of his atoning sacrifice\
7:45\
this does not mean we cannot tell an\
7:47\
experience from our own life\
7:49\
or share thoughts from others while our\
7:53\
subject might be about families or\
7:55\
service or temples\
7:56\
or a recent mission everything in our\
8:00\
worship\
8:01\
should point to the lord jesus christ\
8:05\
thirty years ago president down h oaks\
8:09\
spoke of a letter he had received from a\
8:11\
man who said he had attended a sacrament\
8:14\
meeting\
8:15\
and listened to 17 testimonies\
8:18\
without hearing the savior mentioned\
8:21\
president oaks then noted\
8:24\
perhaps that description is exaggerated\
8:28\
but i quote it because it provides a\
8:30\
vivid reminder\
8:31\
for all of us he then invited us to\
8:34\
speak more of jesus christ in our talks\
8:37\
and class discussions i have observed\
8:41\
that we are focusing more and more on\
8:44\
christ\
8:45\
in our church meetings let's consciously\
8:48\
continue\
8:49\
with these very positive efforts\
8:53\
with those around us let us be more open\
8:57\
more willing to talk of christ president\
9:00\
nelson said\
9:01\
true disciples of jesus christ are\
9:04\
willing to\
9:05\
stand out speak up and be different from\
9:09\
the people of the world\
9:11\
sometimes we think that a conversation\
9:14\
with someone needs to result\
9:16\
in them coming to church or seeing the\
9:18\
missionaries\
9:21\
let the lord guide them as they are\
9:23\
willing\
9:24\
while we think more about our\
9:26\
responsibility\
9:28\
to be a voice for him thoughtful and\
9:30\
open\
9:31\
about our faith elder dieter f\
9:34\
updorf has taught us that when someone\
9:37\
asks us about our weekend\
9:40\
we should be willing to happily respond\
9:43\
that we loved hearing the primary\
9:45\
children sing\
9:46\
i'm trying to be like jesus\
9:50\
let us kindly witness our faith in\
9:52\
christ\
9:53\
if someone shares a problem he or she\
9:56\
has\
9:56\
in their personal life we might say\
10:00\
john mary you know that i believe in\
10:04\
jesus christ i have been thinking about\
10:07\
something he said\
10:08\
that might help you be more open on\
10:12\
social media\
10:13\
in talking about your trust in christ\
10:17\
will respect your faith but if someone\
10:20\
is dismissive when you speak of the\
10:22\
savior\
10:24\
take courage in his promise\
10:27\
blessed are ye when men shall revile you\
10:30\
for my sake for\
10:32\
great is your reward in heaven\
10:36\
we care more about being his followers\
10:40\
than being liked by our own followers\
10:44\
peter counseled be ready always\
10:48\
to give an answer for the hope that is\
10:51\
in you\
10:52\
let us talk of christ\
10:56\
the book of mormon is a powerful witness\
10:58\
of jesus christ\
11:00\
virtually every page testifies of the\
11:02\
savior\
11:03\
and his divine mission an understanding\
11:07\
of his atonement and grace saturates\
11:10\
its pages as a companion\
11:14\
to the new testament the book of mormon\
11:17\
helps us better understand why the\
11:20\
savior came to rescue us\
11:22\
and how we can more profoundly come unto\
11:26\
him\
11:28\
some of our fellow christians are at\
11:30\
times uncertain about our beliefs and\
11:33\
motives\
11:35\
let us genuinely rejoice with them\
11:38\
in our shared faith in jesus christ and\
11:41\
in the new testament scriptures we all\
11:43\
love\
11:45\
in the days ahead those who believe in\
11:48\
jesus christ\
11:50\
will need the friendship and support of\
11:52\
one another\
11:55\
as the world speaks less of jesus christ\
11:58\
let us speak more of him as our true\
12:01\
colors\
12:02\
as his disciples are revealed\
12:05\
many around us will be prepared to\
12:07\
listen\
12:09\
as we share the light we have received\
12:11\
from him\
12:13\
his light and his transcendent saving\
12:16\
power\
12:17\
will shine on those willing to open\
12:19\
their hearts\
12:21\
jesus said i come as a light into the\
12:25\
world\
12:29\
nothing lifts my desire to speak of\
12:31\
christ\
12:32\
more than visualizing his return\
12:36\
while we do not know when he will come\
12:39\
the events of his return\
12:41\
will be breathtaking\
12:44\
he will come in the clouds of heaven in\
12:47\
majesty and glory\
12:48\
with all his holy angels\
12:52\
not just a few angels but all his holy\
12:55\
angels\
12:57\
these are not the cherry cheeked\
12:59\
cherubim painted by raphael found on our\
13:02\
valentine cards\
13:05\
these are the angels of the centuries\
13:09\
the angels sent to shut the mouths of\
13:11\
lions\
13:12\
to open prison doors to announce his\
13:16\
long-awaited birth to comfort him\
13:19\
in gethsemane\
13:22\
to assure his disciples at his ascension\
13:26\
and to open the glorious restoration of\
13:29\
the gospel\
13:31\
can you imagine being caught up to meet\
13:33\
him\
13:34\
whether on this side or the other side\
13:37\
of the veil\
13:39\
that is his promise to the righteous\
13:43\
this amazing experience will mark\
13:46\
our souls forever\
13:51\
how grateful we are for our beloved\
13:53\
prophet\
13:55\
president russell m nelson\
13:58\
who has lifted our desire to love the\
14:00\
savior\
14:02\
and proclaim his divinity\
14:05\
i am an eyewitness to the lord's hand\
14:08\
upon him\
14:09\
and the gift of revelation that guides\
14:11\
him\
14:13\
president nelson we eagerly await your\
14:16\
counsel\
14:18\
my dear friends across the world\
14:22\
let us talk of christ anticipating\
14:26\
his glorious promise whosoever\
14:30\
shall confess me before men him\
14:34\
will i confess before my father\
14:37\
i testify he is\
14:40\
the son of god in the name of jesus\
14:43\
christ\
14:56\
amen\
15:01\
you\
