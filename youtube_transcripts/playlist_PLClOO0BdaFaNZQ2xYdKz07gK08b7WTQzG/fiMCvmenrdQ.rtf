the lord's teachings are\
0:03\
for eternity and for all of god's\
0:06\
children\
0:08\
in this message i will give some\
0:10\
examples from the united states\
0:13\
but the principles i teach are\
0:15\
applicable everywhere\
0:19\
we live in a time of anger and hatred\
0:22\
in political relationships and policies\
0:26\
we felt it this summer where some went\
0:30\
beyond\
0:30\
peaceful protests and engaged in\
0:33\
destructive behavior\
0:36\
we feel it in some current campaigns for\
0:38\
public offices\
0:41\
unfortunately some of this has even\
0:44\
spilled over\
0:45\
into political statements and unkind\
0:48\
references\
0:49\
in our church meetings\
0:53\
in a democratic government we will\
0:55\
always have differences\
0:56\
over proposed candidates and policies\
1:01\
however as followers of christ we must\
1:04\
forego the anger and hatred\
1:06\
with which political choices are debated\
1:09\
or denounced in many settings\
1:13\
here's one of our savior's teachings\
1:16\
probably well known but\
1:18\
rarely practiced ye have heard that it\
1:22\
hath been said\
1:24\
thou shalt love thy neighbor and\
1:27\
hate thine enemy but i say unto you\
1:31\
love your enemies bless them that curse\
1:34\
you\
1:35\
do good to them that hate you and\
1:38\
pray for them which despitefully use you\
1:41\
and persecute you\
1:45\
for generations jews had been taught to\
1:48\
hate their enemies\
1:49\
and they were then suffering under the\
1:51\
domination and cruelties of\
1:54\
roman occupation yet jesus taught them\
1:58\
love your enemies and do good to them\
2:01\
that despitefully use you\
2:04\
what revolutionary teachings for\
2:06\
personal\
2:08\
and political relationships but that\
2:11\
is still what our savior commands\
2:14\
in the book of mormon we read for verily\
2:18\
verily i say unto you\
2:20\
he that hath the spirit of contention is\
2:23\
not of me\
2:24\
but is of the devil who is the father of\
2:27\
contention\
2:28\
and he stirth up the hearts of men to\
2:31\
contend with anger\
2:32\
one with another\
2:36\
loving our enemies and our adversaries\
2:39\
is not easy most of us have not reached\
2:43\
that stage of love and forgiveness\
2:45\
president hinckley observed adding\
2:48\
it requires a self-discipline almost\
2:51\
greater than we are capable of\
2:54\
but it must be essential for it is part\
2:57\
of the savior's two\
2:58\
great commandments to love the lord thy\
3:00\
god\
3:01\
and to love thy neighbor as thyself\
3:05\
and it must be possible for he also\
3:08\
taught\
3:09\
ask and it shall be given you seek\
3:12\
and ye shall find\
3:16\
how do we keep these divine commandments\
3:18\
in a world where we are also\
3:20\
subject to the laws of man\
3:23\
fortunately we have the savior's own\
3:26\
example of how to balance his\
3:28\
eternal laws with the practicalities of\
3:31\
man-made\
3:32\
laws when adversaries sought to trap him\
3:36\
with a question about whether jews\
3:38\
should pay taxes to rome\
3:40\
he pointed to the image of caesar on\
3:43\
their coins\
3:45\
and declared render therefore unto\
3:48\
caesar\
3:49\
the things which be caesar's and\
3:52\
unto god the things which be gods\
3:56\
so we are to follow the laws of men\
3:59\
render unto caesar to live peacefully\
4:02\
under civil authority\
4:04\
and we follow the laws of god toward our\
4:07\
eternal destination\
4:10\
but how do we do this especially how do\
4:13\
we learn\
4:14\
to love our adversaries and our enemies\
4:18\
the savior's teaching not to contend\
4:21\
with anger\
4:23\
is a good first step the devil is the\
4:26\
father of contention\
4:28\
and it is he who tempts man to contend\
4:31\
with anger\
4:32\
he promotes enmity and hateful\
4:35\
relationships among\
4:36\
individuals and within groups\
4:40\
president thomas s monson taught that\
4:42\
anger is\
4:44\
satan's tool for to be angry is to yield\
4:48\
to the influence of satan\
4:50\
no one can make us angry it is\
4:54\
our choice end of quote\
4:58\
anger is the way to division and enmity\
5:02\
we move toward loving our adversaries\
5:04\
when we avoid anger and hostility\
5:07\
toward those with whom we disagree\
5:10\
it also helps if we are even willing to\
5:13\
learn\
5:13\
from them among other ways to develop\
5:17\
the power to love others\
5:19\
is the simple method described in the\
5:22\
long ago\
5:22\
musical when we are trying to understand\
5:26\
and relate to people of a different\
5:29\
culture\
5:30\
we should try getting to know them\
5:33\
in countless circumstances strangers\
5:36\
suspicion or even hostility give way to\
5:40\
friendship or even\
5:41\
love when personal contacts produce\
5:44\
understanding\
5:45\
and mutual respect\
5:49\
an even greater help in learning to love\
5:52\
our adversaries\
5:53\
and our enemies is to seek to understand\
5:56\
the power\
5:57\
of love here are three of many\
6:00\
prophetic teachings about this\
6:04\
the prophet joseph smith taught that it\
6:07\
is\
6:07\
a time-honored adage that love\
6:10\
begets love let us pour forth love\
6:14\
show forth our kindness unto all mankind\
6:18\
end of quote president howard w\
6:22\
hunter taught quote the world in which\
6:25\
we live would benefit\
6:26\
greatly if men and women everywhere\
6:30\
would exercise the pure love of christ\
6:33\
which is kind meek and lowly\
6:37\
it is without envy or pride it seeks\
6:41\
nothing in return\
6:42\
it has no place for bigotry hatred or\
6:45\
violence\
6:47\
it encourages diverse people to live\
6:50\
together in christian love\
6:52\
regardless of religious belief race\
6:55\
nationality financial standing\
6:58\
education or culture end of quote\
7:03\
and president russell m nelson has urged\
7:06\
us to\
7:06\
quote expand our circle of love\
7:11\
to embrace the whole human family\
7:14\
end of quote\
7:18\
an essential part of loving our enemies\
7:20\
is to render unto caesar\
7:23\
by keeping the laws of our various\
7:25\
countries\
7:28\
though jesus teachings were\
7:30\
revolutionary\
7:32\
he did not teach revolution or law\
7:35\
breaking\
7:36\
he taught a better way modern revelation\
7:40\
teaches the same\
7:41\
quote let no man break the laws of the\
7:43\
land\
7:45\
for he that keepeth the laws of god hath\
7:47\
no need to break the laws of the land\
7:50\
wherefore be subject to the powers that\
7:53\
be\
7:54\
and who quote and our article of faith\
7:58\
written by the prophet joseph smith\
8:00\
after the early\
8:02\
saints had suffered severe persecution\
8:04\
from missouri officials\
8:06\
declares quote we believe in being\
8:10\
subject to kings presidents rulers and\
8:13\
magistrates\
8:14\
in obeying honor honoring and\
8:17\
sustaining the law end of quote\
8:21\
this does not mean that we agree with\
8:23\
all that is done with the force of\
8:26\
law it means that we obey\
8:30\
the current law and use peaceful means\
8:33\
to change it\
8:35\
it also means that we peacefully accept\
8:38\
the results of elections\
8:40\
we will not participate in the violence\
8:43\
threatened by those\
8:44\
disappointed with the outcome in a\
8:48\
democratic society we\
8:50\
always have the opportunity and the duty\
8:53\
to persist peacefully until the next\
8:56\
election\
8:59\
the savior's teaching to love our\
9:01\
enemies is based on the reality\
9:03\
that all mortals are beloved children of\
9:06\
god\
9:08\
that eternal principle and some basic\
9:11\
principles of law\
9:13\
were tested in the recent protests in\
9:15\
many american cities\
9:18\
at one extreme some seem to have\
9:21\
forgotten\
9:22\
that the first amendment to the united\
9:24\
states constitution\
9:26\
guarantees the right of the people\
9:29\
peaceably to assemble\
9:31\
and to petition the government for the\
9:34\
redress of grievances\
9:37\
that is the authorized way to raise\
9:39\
public\
9:40\
awareness and to focus on injustices in\
9:44\
the content or administration of the\
9:46\
laws\
9:47\
and there have been injustices in public\
9:50\
actions\
9:51\
and in our personal attitudes we have\
9:55\
had racism\
9:56\
and related grievances in a persuasive\
10:00\
personal\
10:01\
essay the reverend theresa a dear\
10:04\
of the national association for the\
10:06\
advancement of colored people\
10:08\
has reminded us that quote racism\
10:11\
thrives on hatred oppression\
10:14\
passivity indifference and silence\
10:18\
end of quote as citizens\
10:21\
and as members of the church of jesus\
10:23\
christ of latter-day saints\
10:26\
we must do better to help root out\
10:28\
racism\
10:31\
at the other extreme a minority of\
10:34\
participants and\
10:35\
supporters of these protests and the\
10:38\
illegal acts that followed them\
10:40\
seem to have forgotten that the protests\
10:43\
protected by the constitution are\
10:46\
peaceful protests\
10:48\
protesters have no right to destroy\
10:50\
deface\
10:51\
or steal property or to undermine\
10:55\
the government's legitimate police\
10:57\
powers\
10:59\
the constitution and laws contain no\
11:02\
invitation to\
11:03\
revolution or anarchy\
11:06\
all of us police protesters\
11:10\
supporters and spectators should\
11:12\
understand the limits\
11:14\
of our rights and the importance of our\
11:17\
duties\
11:18\
to stay within the boundaries of\
11:20\
existing law\
11:23\
abraham lincoln was right when he said\
11:26\
there is no grievance\
11:28\
that is a fit object of redress by mob\
11:31\
law redress of grievances by mobs\
11:37\
is redressed by illegal means\
11:40\
that is anarchy a condition that has\
11:43\
no effective governance and no formal\
11:47\
police\
11:48\
which undermines rather than protects\
11:51\
individual rights\
11:55\
one reason the recent protests in the\
11:57\
united states were shocking to so many\
12:00\
was that the hostilities and\
12:02\
illegalities felt among\
12:04\
different ethnicities in other nations\
12:08\
should not be felt in the united states\
12:11\
this country should be better in\
12:13\
eliminating racism not only against\
12:15\
black americans\
12:17\
who were most visible in the recent\
12:18\
protests but also against\
12:21\
latinos asians and other groups\
12:25\
this nation's history of racism is not a\
12:28\
happy one\
12:29\
and we must do better\
12:32\
the united states was founded by\
12:34\
immigrants of\
12:35\
different nationalities and different\
12:38\
ethnicities its unifying purpose was not\
12:42\
to establish a particular religion\
12:45\
or to perpetuate any of the diverse\
12:47\
cultures or\
12:48\
tribal loyalties of the old countries\
12:51\
our founding generation sought to be\
12:54\
unified\
12:55\
by a new constitution and laws\
12:59\
that is not to say that our unifying\
13:01\
documents\
13:03\
or the then current understanding of\
13:05\
their meanings were perfect\
13:07\
the history of the first two centuries\
13:09\
of the united states\
13:11\
showed the need for many refinements\
13:14\
such as voting rights for women\
13:16\
and particularly the abolition of\
13:19\
slavery\
13:20\
including laws to assure that those who\
13:23\
had been enslaved\
13:24\
would have all the conditions of freedom\
13:29\
two yale university scholars recently\
13:31\
reminded\
13:32\
us quote for all its flaws the united\
13:36\
states\
13:36\
is uniquely equipped to unite a diverse\
13:40\
and divided society its citizens don't\
13:43\
have to choose between a national\
13:45\
identity and multiculturalism\
13:49\
americans can have both but the key\
13:52\
is constitutional patriotism\
13:56\
we have to remind you remain united by\
14:00\
and through the constitution regardless\
14:03\
of our\
14:04\
ideological disagreements end of quote\
14:09\
many years ago a british foreign\
14:11\
secretary gave this\
14:12\
great council in a debate in the house\
14:15\
of commons\
14:16\
quote we have no eternal\
14:20\
allies and we have no perpetual\
14:23\
enemies our interests are\
14:27\
eternal and perpetual and these\
14:30\
interests it is our duty to follow end\
14:33\
of quote\
14:36\
that is a good secular reason for\
14:38\
following\
14:39\
eternal and perpetual interests in\
14:41\
political matters in addition the\
14:44\
doctrine of the lord's church\
14:46\
teaches us another eternal interest to\
14:50\
guide us\
14:51\
the teachings of our savior who inspired\
14:54\
the constitution of the united states\
14:57\
and the basic laws of many of our\
14:59\
countries\
15:00\
loyalty to established law instead of\
15:03\
temporary\
15:04\
allies is the best way to love our\
15:07\
adversaries\
15:08\
and our enemies as we seek unity\
15:11\
in diversity knowing that we are all\
15:15\
children of god\
15:16\
gives us a divine vision of the worth of\
15:19\
all others\
15:20\
and the will and ability to rise above\
15:23\
prejudice\
15:24\
and racism as i've lived for many years\
15:27\
in different places in this nation\
15:30\
the lord has taught me that it is\
15:32\
possible to obey\
15:33\
and seek to improve our nation's laws\
15:36\
and also to love our adversaries and our\
15:39\
enemies\
15:41\
while not easy it is possible with the\
15:44\
help of our lord jesus christ\
15:47\
he gave this command to love and he\
15:50\
promises\
15:51\
his help as we seek to obey it\
15:54\
i testify that we are loved and will be\
15:57\
helped\
15:58\
by our heavenly father and his son jesus\
16:01\
christ\
16:03\
in the name of jesus christ amen\
