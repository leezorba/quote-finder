to even the careful student\
0:03\
of the life and ministry of jesus christ\
0:06\
the savior's admonition to be\
0:08\
even as i am is daunting and seemingly\
0:11\
unattainable\
0:12\
perhaps you were like me all too aware\
0:15\
of your faults and failings\
0:16\
so you may find it mentally more\
0:18\
comfortable to walk a path with no\
0:20\
upward incline and little growth\
0:22\
surely this teaching is unrealistic and\
0:25\
hyperbole we rationalize\
0:27\
as we comfortably choose the course of\
0:29\
least resistance\
0:30\
thereby burning fewer calories of needed\
0:33\
change\
0:34\
but what if becoming even as he is is\
0:37\
not figurative\
0:38\
even in our moral condition what if it\
0:41\
is to some degree\
0:42\
attainable in this life and indeed a\
0:44\
prerequisite\
0:45\
to being with him again what if even as\
0:48\
i am\
0:49\
is exactly and precisely what is meant\
0:52\
by the savior\
0:54\
then what what level of effort would we\
0:57\
be willing to give\
0:58\
to invite his miraculous power into our\
1:00\
lives\
1:01\
so that we can change our very nature\
1:04\
elder neil a maxwell taught quote as we\
1:08\
ponder having been commanded by jesus to\
1:10\
become like him\
1:11\
we see that our present circumstance is\
1:14\
one in which we are not necessarily\
1:16\
wicked\
1:17\
but rather is one in which we are so\
1:19\
half-hearted\
1:20\
and so lacking in enthusiasm for his\
1:22\
cause\
1:23\
which is our cause too we extol\
1:26\
but seldom emulate him end quote\
1:30\
a young minister charles m sheldon\
1:33\
expressed similar sentiments this way\
1:35\
quote our christianity loves its ease\
1:38\
and comfort too well\
1:40\
to take up anything so rough and heavy\
1:43\
as a cross end quote in fact\
1:47\
all are under the directive to become\
1:49\
like him just as jesus christ became\
1:51\
like the father\
1:53\
as we progress we become more complete\
1:55\
finished and fully developed\
1:58\
such teaching is not based on anyone's\
2:00\
sex doctrines\
2:01\
but come directly from the master\
2:03\
himself\
2:05\
it is through this lens that lives\
2:06\
should be lived communications\
2:08\
considered\
2:09\
and relationships fostered truly there\
2:13\
is no other way\
2:14\
to heal the wounds of broken\
2:16\
relationships or of a fractured society\
2:19\
than for each of us to more fully\
2:22\
emulate\
2:22\
the prince of peace let's consider how\
2:26\
to begin a thoughtful\
2:27\
deliberate and intentional pursuit of\
2:29\
becoming as he\
2:31\
is by gaining the very attributes of\
2:33\
jesus christ\
2:35\
a few years ago my wife and i stood at\
2:37\
the trail head of japan's highest\
2:39\
mountain\
2:40\
mount fuji as we began our ascent\
2:43\
we looked up to this far distant summit\
2:45\
and wondered if we could get there\
2:48\
as we progressed fatigue sore muscles\
2:50\
and the effects of altitude set in\
2:53\
mentally it became important for us to\
2:55\
focus on just the next step\
2:57\
we would say i may not soon make it to\
3:00\
the top\
3:00\
but i can do this next step right now\
3:04\
over time the daunting task ultimately\
3:06\
became achievable\
3:07\
step by step the first step\
3:11\
on this path to becoming like jesus\
3:13\
christ\
3:14\
is to have the desire to do so\
3:16\
understanding the admonition to be like\
3:19\
him is good\
3:20\
but that understanding needs to be\
3:22\
coupled with a yearning to transform\
3:24\
ourselves\
3:25\
one step at a time beyond the natural\
3:28\
man\
3:29\
to develop the desire we must know who\
3:31\
he is\
3:32\
we must know something of his character\
3:34\
and we must look for his attributes in\
3:36\
scripture\
3:37\
worship services and other holy places\
3:40\
as we begin to know more of him we will\
3:43\
see his attributes reflected in others\
3:45\
this will encourage us\
3:47\
on our own quest forth others can attain\
3:50\
in some measure his attributes so can we\
3:54\
if we are honest with ourselves the\
3:56\
light of christ within us whispers that\
3:58\
there is distance\
3:59\
between where we are in comparison with\
4:02\
the desired character of the savior\
4:04\
such honesty is vital if we are to\
4:06\
progress in becoming like him\
4:08\
indeed honesty is one of his attributes\
4:12\
now those of us who are brave might\
4:14\
consider\
4:15\
asking a trusted family member spouse\
4:18\
friend or spiritual leader\
4:20\
what attribute of jesus christ we are in\
4:22\
need of\
4:23\
and we may need to brace ourselves for\
4:25\
the response\
4:27\
sometimes we see ourselves with\
4:29\
distorted funhouse mirrors\
4:31\
that show us either much more round or\
4:33\
much more lean than we really\
4:35\
are trusted friends and family can help\
4:38\
us see ourselves more accurately\
4:40\
but even they as loving and helpful as\
4:43\
they would like to be\
4:44\
can see things imperfectly as a result\
4:48\
it is vital that we ask our loving\
4:50\
heavenly father\
4:52\
what we are need of and where we should\
4:54\
focus our efforts\
4:55\
he has a perfect view of us and will\
4:58\
lovingly show us our weakness\
5:01\
perhaps you will learn that you need\
5:02\
greater patience humility\
5:04\
charity love hope diligence or obedience\
5:08\
to name a few\
5:10\
not long ago i had a soul-stretching\
5:12\
experience when a loving church leader\
5:15\
made a very direct suggestion that i\
5:17\
could use a greater measure\
5:19\
of a certain attribute he lovingly cut\
5:22\
through\
5:22\
any distortion that night i shared this\
5:26\
experience with my wife\
5:27\
she was mercifully charitable even as\
5:30\
she agreed with his suggestion\
5:33\
the holy ghost confirmed to me that\
5:35\
their counsel was from a loving heavenly\
5:37\
father\
5:38\
it may also be helpful to honestly\
5:40\
complete the christ-like attribute\
5:42\
activity\
5:43\
in chapter 6 to preach my gospel\
5:46\
once you have made an assessment an\
5:48\
honest assessment\
5:49\
and resolved to start the hike up the\
5:52\
mountain you will need to repent\
5:54\
president russell m nelson lovingly\
5:56\
taught quote\
5:58\
when we choose to repent we choose to\
6:00\
change\
6:01\
we allow the savior to transform us into\
6:04\
the best version of ourselves\
6:06\
we choose to grow spiritually and\
6:08\
receive joy\
6:10\
the joy of redemption in him when we\
6:13\
choose to repent\
6:14\
we choose to become more like jesus\
6:17\
christ\
6:18\
end quote becoming as jesus christ is\
6:21\
will require changing our hearts and\
6:23\
minds indeed our very character\
6:25\
and doing so is possible only through\
6:28\
the saving grace\
6:29\
of jesus christ now that you have\
6:32\
resolved to change and repent and have\
6:34\
sought guidance through prayer\
6:35\
pondering honestly and possibly\
6:38\
counseling with others\
6:39\
you will need to select an attribute\
6:41\
that will keenly become your focus\
6:44\
you will need to commit to exerting\
6:45\
meaningful effort\
6:47\
these attributes won't come cheaply and\
6:49\
suddenly\
6:50\
but through his grace they will come\
6:52\
incrementally\
6:53\
while endeavoring christ-like attributes\
6:56\
are gifts from a loving heavenly father\
6:58\
to bless us and those around us\
7:01\
accordingly\
7:02\
all efforts to obtain these attributes\
7:04\
will require heartfelt pleas for his\
7:06\
divine assistance\
7:08\
if we seek these gifts to better serve\
7:10\
others he will bless us in our efforts\
7:13\
selfishly pursuing a gift from god will\
7:16\
end in disappointment\
7:17\
and frustration by focusing deeply on\
7:20\
one needed attribute\
7:22\
as you progress in obtaining that\
7:24\
attribute other attributes begin to\
7:27\
accrue to you\
7:28\
cannot someone who is focusing deeply on\
7:31\
charity\
7:32\
not increase in love and humility cannot\
7:35\
someone who is focusing on obedience\
7:37\
not gain greater diligence and hope\
7:41\
your significant efforts to gain one\
7:43\
attribute\
7:44\
become the tide that raises all boats\
7:47\
in the harbor it is important for me as\
7:50\
i strive to become like him to record my\
7:52\
experiences\
7:53\
and what i'm learning as i study with\
7:56\
one of his attributes deep in my mind\
7:57\
the scriptures become new\
7:59\
as i see examples of the this attribute\
8:01\
in his teachings his ministry and his\
8:03\
disciples\
8:05\
my eye becomes more focused on\
8:07\
recognizing the attribute in others\
8:09\
i have observed wonderful individuals\
8:11\
both within\
8:12\
and without the church who have\
8:14\
attributes that emulate him\
8:17\
they are powerful examples of how those\
8:19\
attributes can be manifest in mere\
8:21\
mortals\
8:22\
through his loving grace in order to see\
8:25\
real progress you will need to put in\
8:27\
sustained effort\
8:28\
much like climbing a mountain requires\
8:30\
preparation before\
8:32\
and endurance and perseverance during\
8:34\
ascend\
8:35\
so too will this journey require real\
8:37\
effort and sacrifice\
8:39\
true christianity in which we strive to\
8:41\
become like our master\
8:43\
has always required our best efforts\
8:46\
now a brief word of caution the\
8:49\
commandment to be like him is not\
8:51\
intended to make you feel guilty\
8:53\
unworthy or\
8:54\
unloved our entire mortal experience is\
8:57\
about progression\
8:58\
trying failing and succeeding as much as\
9:02\
my wife and i may have wished\
9:04\
that we could close our eyes and\
9:05\
magically transport ourselves to the\
9:07\
summit\
9:08\
that is not what life is about you are\
9:11\
good enough\
9:13\
you are loved but that does not mean\
9:16\
that you are yet complete there is work\
9:19\
to be done in this life\
9:20\
and the next only with his divine help\
9:23\
can we progress toward becoming like him\
9:26\
in these times when all things appear to\
9:29\
be in commotion\
9:30\
and fear is seemingly upon all people\
9:34\
the only antidote the only remedy is to\
9:37\
strive to be like the savior\
9:39\
the redeemer of all mankind the light of\
9:41\
the world\
9:42\
and to seek after he who declared i\
9:45\
am the way i know that becoming like him\
9:49\
through his divine help and strength is\
9:50\
achievable\
9:51\
step by step if not so he would not have\
9:54\
given us this commandment\
9:56\
i know this in part because i see\
9:58\
attributes of him\
9:59\
in so many of you of these things i\
10:02\
testify\
10:03\
in the name of jesus christ amen\
10:20\
you\
