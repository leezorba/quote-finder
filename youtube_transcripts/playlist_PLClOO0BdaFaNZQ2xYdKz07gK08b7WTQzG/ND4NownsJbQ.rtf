years ago as a young missionary laboring\
0:03\
in a tiny branch on the small island of\
0:06\
amami oshima\
0:07\
japan one day my companion and i were\
0:11\
ecstatic to learn that president spencer\
0:13\
w kimball\
0:15\
would be visiting asia and that all\
0:17\
members and missionaries in japan were\
0:19\
invited to tokyo\
0:21\
to hear the prophet and at an area\
0:24\
conference\
0:26\
with branch members my companion and i\
0:28\
excitedly began\
0:30\
making plans for the conference which\
0:33\
would require a 12-hour boat ride\
0:36\
across the east china sea to mainland\
0:38\
japan\
0:39\
followed by a 15-hour train ride to\
0:42\
tokyo\
0:44\
sadly however it was not to be\
0:48\
we received word from our mission\
0:49\
president because of distance and time\
0:51\
my companion and i\
0:53\
would not be able to attend the\
0:54\
conference in tokyo\
0:56\
while members of our little branch\
0:58\
embarked for tokyo\
1:00\
we stayed behind the following days\
1:03\
seemed\
1:04\
quiet and empty we held sacrament\
1:07\
meeting alone in the small chapel while\
1:09\
latter-day saints and missionaries of\
1:11\
japan attended the conference\
1:14\
my sense of personal disappointment\
1:16\
intensified even as i\
1:18\
joyfully listened to branch members\
1:20\
returned from the conference\
1:22\
days later to report that president\
1:25\
kimball had announced\
1:27\
a temple in tokyo they gushed with\
1:30\
excitement as they shared the\
1:31\
fulfillment of their dream\
1:34\
they described how upon hearing the\
1:36\
temple announcement\
1:37\
members and missionaries were unable to\
1:40\
contain their joy\
1:41\
and spontaneously erupted into clapping\
1:44\
their hands\
1:47\
years have passed but i can still\
1:48\
remember the disappointment i felt from\
1:50\
missing that historic meeting\
1:53\
in recent months i have reflected upon\
1:55\
this\
1:57\
as i have observed others face deep\
2:00\
disappointment and sorrow far greater\
2:03\
and deeper than mine ever was as a young\
2:05\
missionary\
2:07\
brought on by the worldwide coven 19\
2:09\
pandemic\
2:11\
earlier this year as the pandemic\
2:13\
accelerated the first presidency pledged\
2:15\
that\
2:16\
the church and its members will\
2:18\
faithfully exhibit our commitment to\
2:19\
being good\
2:20\
citizens and good neighbors and will use\
2:23\
an abundance of caution\
2:26\
thus we experience the suspension of\
2:29\
church\
2:30\
gatherings worldwide the return of more\
2:32\
than half the\
2:33\
church's missionary force to their home\
2:36\
nations\
2:37\
and the closure of temples throughout\
2:39\
the church\
2:41\
thousands of you were were preparing to\
2:44\
enter the temple for living ordinances\
2:46\
including temple ceilings others of you\
2:50\
have completed your services\
2:51\
missionaries early or have been\
2:53\
temporarily released and reassigned\
2:57\
during this time government and\
2:59\
educational leaders closed schools which\
3:01\
consequently\
3:03\
altered graduations and forced the\
3:05\
cancellation of\
3:07\
sporting social cultural and educational\
3:09\
events\
3:10\
and activities many of you prepared for\
3:13\
events that were not attended\
3:16\
performances that were not heard and\
3:18\
athletic seasons that were not played\
3:22\
even more poignant are the thoughts of\
3:24\
families who have lost loved ones during\
3:26\
this time\
3:27\
most could not hold funerals or other\
3:30\
tender gatherings\
3:31\
as they hoped in short many many of you\
3:35\
have dealt with heartbreaking\
3:36\
disappointment sorrow and discouragement\
3:39\
so how do we heal endure and move\
3:43\
forward when things\
3:44\
seemed so broken the prophet nephi began\
3:48\
engraving the small plates when he was a\
3:50\
grown man\
3:52\
as he looked back on his life and\
3:54\
ministry he offered an\
3:55\
important reflection in the very first\
3:58\
verse of the book of mormon\
4:00\
this verse frames an important principle\
4:02\
for us to consider in our time\
4:05\
following his familiar words i nephi\
4:07\
having been born of goodly parents he\
4:09\
writes\
4:10\
and having seen many afflictions in the\
4:12\
course of my days\
4:14\
nevertheless having been highly favored\
4:16\
of the lord\
4:17\
in all my days\
4:20\
as students of the book of mormon were\
4:22\
familiar with the many afflictions to\
4:24\
which nephi refers\
4:27\
yet following acknowledgement of his\
4:29\
afflictions in the course of his days\
4:31\
nephi gives his gospel perspective\
4:36\
of being highly favored of the lord in\
4:38\
all of his days\
4:40\
times of affliction and disappointment\
4:43\
do not\
4:43\
change the watchful eye of the lord as\
4:46\
he\
4:47\
favorably looks upon us blessing us\
4:51\
lisa and i recently met virtually with\
4:53\
about 600 missionaries in australia\
4:56\
most of whom were under some measure of\
4:59\
confinement or restriction\
5:01\
related to covet 19\
5:04\
many working from their apartments\
5:06\
together we considered individuals in\
5:08\
the new testament book of mormon and\
5:10\
doctrine and covenants\
5:12\
who like them the lord blessed to\
5:15\
accomplish greatness in adversity\
5:18\
define more by what they were able to do\
5:20\
with the lord's\
5:21\
help in spite of their confinement and\
5:24\
and restriction we read of paul and\
5:28\
silas\
5:29\
while imprisoned in stocks praying\
5:32\
singing teaching testifying even\
5:35\
baptizing the jailer\
5:38\
and again of paul in rome under house\
5:40\
arrest for two years\
5:42\
during which time he continually\
5:45\
expounded and testified the kingdom of\
5:47\
god\
5:48\
teaching those things which concerned\
5:49\
the lord jesus christ\
5:52\
of nephi and lehi the sons of helaman\
5:55\
who after\
5:55\
abuse and imprisonment were encircled by\
5:59\
a fire of protection as the lord's still\
6:01\
small voice of\
6:03\
perfect mildness did pierce their\
6:06\
captors\
6:07\
even to the very soul\
6:10\
of alma and amulek in ammoniah who found\
6:13\
that\
6:14\
many did believe and began to repent and\
6:16\
to search the scriptures\
6:18\
even though they were then mocked and\
6:21\
without food water or clothes\
6:24\
bound and confined in prison\
6:27\
and finally of joseph smith\
6:30\
languishing in the liberty jail\
6:33\
feeling abandoned and forsaken\
6:37\
then hearing the words of the lord these\
6:40\
things\
6:41\
shall be for thy good and god shall be\
6:45\
with you forever\
6:47\
each of these understood what nephi knew\
6:50\
that although they had seen many\
6:51\
afflictions in the course of their days\
6:54\
yet they were highly favored of the lord\
6:57\
we too can draw parallels as individual\
6:59\
members\
7:00\
and as a church in the way in which we\
7:02\
have been highly favored of the lord\
7:04\
during the challenging times we have\
7:06\
encountered during the past several\
7:08\
months\
7:10\
as i cite these examples let them also\
7:14\
strengthen your testimony of the\
7:15\
seership of our living prophet\
7:17\
who prepared us with adjustments before\
7:20\
any hint of a pandemic\
7:22\
enabling us to endure the challenges\
7:24\
that have come\
7:26\
first becoming more home centered and\
7:28\
church supported\
7:29\
two years ago president nelson said we\
7:32\
have become accustomed to\
7:34\
thinking of church as something that\
7:35\
happens in our meetinghouses\
7:38\
supported by what happens at home we\
7:40\
need an adjustment to this pattern\
7:42\
a home-centered church supported by what\
7:44\
takes place\
7:46\
inside our buildings\
7:49\
what a prophetic adjustment home center\
7:52\
gospel learning has been put into\
7:53\
practice with the temporary closure of\
7:55\
meeting houses even as the world begins\
7:59\
to normalize and we return to chapels\
8:02\
we'll want to retain our home center\
8:04\
patterns of gospel study and learning\
8:06\
developed during the pandemic\
8:09\
a second example is of being highly\
8:13\
favored of the lord\
8:14\
is the revelation regarding ministering\
8:17\
in a higher and holier way in 2018\
8:21\
president nelson introduced ministering\
8:23\
as an adjustment in the way we care for\
8:26\
each other\
8:27\
the pandemic has introduced numerous\
8:30\
opportunities to hone\
8:31\
our ministering skills ministering\
8:34\
brothers and sisters\
8:36\
young women and young men and others\
8:38\
have reached out to provide contact\
8:41\
conversation yard care meals messages\
8:44\
via technology\
8:46\
and the sacrament ordinance to bless\
8:48\
those in need\
8:50\
the church itself has also been\
8:52\
ministering to others during the\
8:53\
pandemic with an\
8:55\
unprecedented distribution of\
8:57\
commodities to food banks\
8:59\
homeless shelters and immigrant support\
9:01\
centers\
9:02\
and with projects directed to the\
9:04\
world's most serious\
9:05\
hunger situations relief society sisters\
9:09\
and their families responded to the\
9:11\
challenge of making millions of masks\
9:13\
for health care workers a final example\
9:17\
of being blessed during adversity\
9:20\
is finding heightened joy in the return\
9:23\
of temple ordinances\
9:25\
this is best described with a story\
9:28\
when sister caitlin palmer received her\
9:30\
mission call last april\
9:32\
she was excited to be called as a\
9:34\
missionary but felt it equally important\
9:36\
and special to go to the temple\
9:39\
to receive her endowment and make sacred\
9:40\
covenants\
9:42\
shortly after she scheduled her\
9:44\
endowment the announcement came that\
9:46\
all temples would temporarily close due\
9:48\
to the worldwide pandemic\
9:51\
after receiving this heartbreaking\
9:52\
information she then\
9:54\
learned she would attend the mtc\
9:56\
virtually from her home\
9:59\
despite these disappointments caitlyn\
10:01\
focused on keeping her spirits high\
10:03\
in the intervening months sister palmer\
10:05\
never lost hope of attending the temple\
10:08\
her family fasted and prayed that\
10:10\
temples would open\
10:11\
prior to her departure caitlyn would\
10:14\
often start her\
10:15\
morning mtc study by saying\
10:19\
is today going to be the day we receive\
10:21\
a miracle and the temples open back\
10:23\
up on august 10th the first presidency\
10:26\
announced that caitlyn's temple would\
10:28\
reopen for living ordinances\
10:30\
on the exact day her early morning\
10:33\
flight her mission was scheduled\
10:35\
she would not be able to attend the\
10:37\
temple and make her flight\
10:39\
with little hope for success her family\
10:41\
contacted temple president michael\
10:43\
valenga\
10:44\
to see if there was any way the miracle\
10:46\
they had been praying for could be\
10:48\
realized\
10:49\
their fasting and prayers were answered\
10:52\
at 2\
10:52\
a.m hours before her flight departure\
10:55\
sister palmer and her family\
10:57\
in tears were greeted at the temple\
10:59\
doors by the smiling temple president\
11:01\
with the words\
11:02\
good morning palmer family welcome to\
11:05\
the temple\
11:07\
as she completed her endowment they were\
11:09\
encouraged to move quickly\
11:11\
as the next family was waiting at the\
11:12\
temple doors\
11:14\
they drove directly to the airport just\
11:16\
in time\
11:17\
to make her fly to her mission\
11:20\
the temple ordinances we have missed\
11:22\
over several months\
11:24\
seem sweeter than previously imagined as\
11:27\
temples around the world\
11:29\
reopen in phases\
11:32\
as i close please listen to the\
11:35\
encouraging\
11:36\
enthusiastic uplifting words of the\
11:39\
prophet joseph smith\
11:41\
one would never guess he penned them in\
11:44\
affliction and isolation\
11:46\
constrained and restricted at a home in\
11:48\
nauvoo\
11:50\
hiding from those who were seeking to\
11:52\
illegally\
11:53\
apprehend him quote\
11:56\
now what do we hear in the gospel which\
11:58\
we have received\
12:00\
a voice of gladness a voice of mercy\
12:02\
from heaven and a voice of truth out of\
12:04\
the earth\
12:05\
glad tidings for the dead a voice of\
12:08\
gladness for the living and the dead\
12:10\
glad tidings of great joy shall we not\
12:14\
go\
12:14\
on in so great a cause go forward\
12:18\
and not backward courage and on\
12:22\
onto the victory let your hearts rejoice\
12:25\
and be exceedingly glad let the earth\
12:29\
break forth into singing close quote\
12:34\
brothers and sisters i believe that one\
12:36\
day each of you will look back at the\
12:39\
cancelled events\
12:41\
the sadness disappointments and\
12:43\
loneliness attendant to the challenging\
12:46\
times we are passing through\
12:48\
to see if to see it overshadowed by\
12:51\
choice blessings\
12:53\
and increased faith and testimonies\
12:56\
i believe that in this life and in the\
12:58\
life to come your afflictions\
13:01\
your emmani ha your liberty jail\
13:05\
will be considered for your gain\
13:08\
i pray that along with nephi we can\
13:11\
acknowledge\
13:12\
the afflictions in the course of our\
13:14\
days\
13:15\
while at the same time recognizing that\
13:17\
we are highly favored of the lord\
13:21\
i close with my testimony of jesus\
13:23\
christ who\
13:24\
himself was no stranger to affliction\
13:28\
and as part of his infinite atonement\
13:31\
descended below\
13:32\
all things he understands our grief\
13:35\
pain and desperation he is our savior\
13:39\
our redeemer our hope our consolation\
13:43\
and our deliverer\
13:45\
of this i testify in his holy name\
13:49\
jesus christ amen\
14:07\
you\
