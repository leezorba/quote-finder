as followers of jesus christ and his\
0:04\
latter-day saints\
0:05\
we strive and are encouraged to strive\
0:07\
to do better\
0:09\
and be better perhaps you've wondered as\
0:12\
i have\
0:13\
am i doing enough what else should i be\
0:16\
doing\
0:17\
or how can i as a flawed person\
0:21\
qualify to dwell with god in a state of\
0:24\
never-ending happiness\
0:27\
the old testament prophet micah asked\
0:29\
the question this way\
0:31\
where will shall i come before the lord\
0:33\
and bow myself before the high god\
0:36\
micah satirically wondered whether even\
0:38\
exorbitant offerings\
0:40\
might be enough to compensate for sin\
0:42\
saying\
0:43\
will the lord be pleased with thousands\
0:45\
of rams or with ten thousand rivers of\
0:48\
oil\
0:49\
shall i give my firstborn for the sin of\
0:52\
my soul\
0:54\
the answer is no\
0:57\
good deeds are not sufficient salvation\
1:01\
is not earned not even the vast\
1:03\
sacrifices micah knew were impossible\
1:06\
can redeem the smallest sin left to our\
1:09\
own devices the prospect of returning to\
1:12\
live\
1:12\
in god's presence is hopeless\
1:17\
without the blessings that come from\
1:18\
heavenly father and jesus christ\
1:21\
we can never do enough or be enough by\
1:23\
ourselves\
1:25\
the good news though is that because of\
1:28\
and through jesus christ we can become\
1:31\
enough all people will be saved from\
1:34\
physical death by the grace of god\
1:36\
through the death and resurrection of\
1:38\
jesus christ and if we turn our hearts\
1:41\
to god\
1:42\
salvation from spiritual death is\
1:44\
available to all through the atonement\
1:46\
of jesus christ\
1:48\
by obedience to the laws and ordinances\
1:50\
of the gospel\
1:52\
we can be redeemed\
1:55\
and stand pure and clean before god\
1:59\
as micah explained god hath showed the o\
2:03\
man\
2:03\
what is good and what doth the lord\
2:06\
require thee\
2:08\
but to do justly and to love mercy\
2:12\
and to walk humbly with thy god\
2:16\
micah's direction on turning our hearts\
2:19\
to god and qualifying for salvation\
2:21\
contains three\
2:23\
interconnected elements doing justly\
2:26\
means acting honorably with god and with\
2:29\
other people\
2:31\
we act honorably with god by walking\
2:34\
humbly with him\
2:35\
we act honorably with others by loving\
2:38\
mercy\
2:40\
to do justly is therefore a practical\
2:42\
application\
2:44\
of the first and second great\
2:45\
commandments to love the lord thy god\
2:47\
with all thy heart and with all thy soul\
2:49\
and with all thy mind\
2:51\
and to love thy neighbor as thyself\
2:55\
to do justly and walk humbly with god\
2:58\
is to intentionally withdraw our hand\
3:01\
from iniquity\
3:03\
walk in his statutes and remain\
3:05\
authentically\
3:06\
faithful a just person turns away from\
3:10\
sin and toward god\
3:11\
makes covenants with him and keeps those\
3:14\
covenants\
3:15\
a just person chooses to obey the\
3:18\
commandments of god\
3:20\
repents when falling short and keeps on\
3:23\
trying\
3:24\
when the resurrected christ visited the\
3:27\
nephites he explained that the law of\
3:29\
moses had been replaced by a higher law\
3:32\
he instructed them not to offer up\
3:34\
sacrifices and burnt offerings any\
3:36\
longer\
3:37\
but to offer a broken heart and a\
3:39\
contrite spirit\
3:41\
he also promised and who so cometh unto\
3:44\
me\
3:45\
with a broken heart and a contrite\
3:47\
spirit\
3:48\
him will i baptize with fire and with\
3:51\
the holy ghost\
3:53\
when we receive and use the gift of the\
3:56\
holy ghost after baptism\
3:58\
we can enjoy the constant companionship\
4:00\
of the holy ghost\
4:02\
and be taught all things that we should\
4:03\
do including\
4:05\
how to walk humbly with god\
4:09\
jesus christ sacrificed for sin and\
4:12\
salvation from spiritual death\
4:14\
are available to all who have such a\
4:16\
broken heart\
4:17\
and contrite spirit a broken heart and\
4:21\
contrite spirit prompt us to joyfully\
4:23\
repent\
4:24\
and try to become more like our heavenly\
4:26\
father and jesus christ\
4:29\
as we do so we receive the savior's\
4:32\
cleansing\
4:33\
healing and strengthening power\
4:36\
we not only do justly and walk humbly\
4:38\
with god\
4:39\
we also learn to love mercy the way that\
4:43\
heavenly father and jesus christ do\
4:46\
god delights in mercy\
4:50\
and does not begrudge its use\
4:53\
in micah's words to jehovah who\
4:56\
is a god like unto thee that pardon with\
4:59\
iniquity will have compassion upon us\
5:02\
and will cast all sins into the depths\
5:04\
of the sea\
5:06\
to love mercy as god does is inseparably\
5:09\
connected\
5:10\
to dealing justly with others and not\
5:12\
mistreating them\
5:15\
the importance of not mistreating others\
5:17\
is highlighted in an\
5:18\
anecdote about hillel the elder a jewish\
5:22\
scholar who lived in the first century\
5:24\
before christ one of hillel's students\
5:27\
was exasperated by the complexity of the\
5:30\
torah\
5:30\
the five books of moses with their 613\
5:33\
commandments and associated rabbinic\
5:35\
writings\
5:37\
the student challenged hillel to explain\
5:40\
the torah\
5:41\
using only the time that hillel could\
5:43\
stand on one foot\
5:46\
hillel may not have had great balance\
5:49\
but accepted the challenge he quoted\
5:52\
from leviticus saying\
5:55\
thou shalt not avenge nor bear any\
5:57\
grudge against the children of thy\
5:59\
people\
6:00\
but thou shalt love thy neighbor as\
6:02\
thyself\
6:04\
hillel then concluded that which is\
6:07\
hateful unto you\
6:09\
do not do to your neighbor this\
6:12\
is the whole of the torah the rest is\
6:16\
commentary\
6:17\
go forth and study always dealing\
6:21\
honorably with others is part of loving\
6:23\
mercy\
6:25\
consider a conversation i overheard\
6:27\
decades ago in the emergency department\
6:30\
of johns hopkins hospital in baltimore\
6:32\
maryland in the united states\
6:34\
a patient mr jackson was a courteous\
6:38\
pleasant man who was well known to the\
6:40\
hospital staff\
6:41\
he'd previously been hospitalized\
6:43\
multiple of times\
6:45\
for the treatment of alcohol-related\
6:47\
diseases\
6:48\
on this occasion mr jackson returned to\
6:51\
the hospital for symptoms that would be\
6:53\
diagnosed\
6:54\
as inflammation of the pancreas caused\
6:56\
by alcohol consumption\
6:59\
toward the end of his shift dr cohen\
7:02\
a hard-working and admired physician\
7:05\
evaluated mr jackson\
7:07\
and determined that hospitalization was\
7:09\
warranted\
7:11\
dr cohen assigned dr jones the physician\
7:14\
next up in rotation\
7:15\
to admit mr jackson and oversee his\
7:17\
treatment\
7:19\
dr jones had attended a prestigious\
7:22\
medical school\
7:23\
and was just beginning her postgraduate\
7:25\
studies\
7:26\
this grueling training was often\
7:29\
associated with sleep deprivation\
7:31\
which likely contributed to dr jones\
7:34\
negative response\
7:36\
confronted with her fifth admission of\
7:38\
the night she complained loudly to dr\
7:41\
cohen she felt it was unfair that she\
7:44\
would have to spend many hours caring\
7:45\
for mr jackson\
7:47\
because his predicament was after all\
7:50\
self-inflicted\
7:53\
dr cohen's emphatic response was spoken\
7:56\
in\
7:56\
almost a whisper he said\
7:59\
dr jones you became a physician\
8:03\
to care for people and work to heal them\
8:07\
you didn't become a physician to judge\
8:09\
them\
8:10\
if you don't understand the difference\
8:13\
you have no right\
8:14\
to train at this institution\
8:18\
following this correction dr jones\
8:20\
diligently cared for mr jackson\
8:22\
during the hospitalization\
8:25\
jackson has since died both dr jones and\
8:29\
dr cohen have had stellar careers\
8:32\
but at a critical moment in her training\
8:35\
dr jones needed to be reminded to do\
8:38\
justly\
8:39\
to love mercy and to care for mr jackson\
8:43\
without\
8:43\
being judgmental over the years\
8:47\
i've benefited from that reminder\
8:50\
loving mercy means that we do not just\
8:53\
love the mercy god extends to us\
8:56\
we delight that god extends the same\
8:59\
mercy\
9:00\
to others and we follow his example\
9:03\
all are alike unto god and we all need\
9:05\
spiritual treatment to be helped and\
9:08\
healed\
9:10\
the lord has said ye shall not esteem\
9:12\
one flesh above another\
9:14\
or one man shall not think himself above\
9:16\
another\
9:18\
jesus christ exemplified what it means\
9:20\
to do justly\
9:22\
and to love mercy he freely associated\
9:25\
with sinners\
9:26\
treating them honorably and with respect\
9:29\
he taught the joy of keeping god's\
9:31\
commandments and sought to lift\
9:34\
rather than condemn those who struggled\
9:36\
he did denounce those who faulted him\
9:39\
for ministering to people they deemed\
9:41\
unworthy\
9:43\
such self-righteousness offended him\
9:47\
and still does to be christ-like\
9:51\
a person does justly behaving honorably\
9:54\
with both god and other people\
9:57\
a just person is civil in words and\
9:59\
action\
10:00\
and recognizes that differences in\
10:02\
outlook or belief do not preclude\
10:04\
genuine kindness and friendship\
10:08\
individuals who do justly will not have\
10:10\
a mind to injure one another but to live\
10:12\
peaceably one with another\
10:14\
to be christ-like a person loves mercy\
10:18\
people who love mercy are not judgmental\
10:22\
they manifest compassion for others\
10:24\
especially for those who are less\
10:26\
fortunate\
10:27\
they're gracious kind and honorable\
10:30\
these individuals treat everyone with\
10:33\
love and understanding regardless of\
10:35\
characteristics\
10:36\
such as race gender\
10:39\
religious affiliation sexual orientation\
10:42\
socioeconomic status and tribal clan or\
10:45\
national differences\
10:47\
these are superseded by christ-like love\
10:53\
to be christ like a person chooses god\
10:56\
walks humbly with him seeks to please\
10:58\
him and keeps covenants with him\
11:00\
individuals who walk humbly with god\
11:02\
remember what heavenly father and jesus\
11:05\
christ have done\
11:05\
for them am i doing enough\
11:10\
what else should i be doing the action\
11:13\
we\
11:14\
take in response to these questions is\
11:17\
central to our happiness in this life\
11:19\
and in the eternities the savior does\
11:22\
not want us to take salvation for\
11:24\
granted\
11:26\
even after we've made sacred covenants\
11:28\
there is a possibility\
11:29\
that we may fall from grace and depart\
11:31\
from the living god\
11:32\
so we should take heed and pray always\
11:34\
to avoid falling into temptation\
11:38\
but at the same time our heavenly father\
11:41\
and jesus\
11:42\
christ do not want us to be paralyzed by\
11:45\
continual uncertainty during our mortal\
11:47\
journey\
11:48\
wondering whether we've done enough to\
11:50\
be saved and exalted\
11:52\
they surely do not want us to be\
11:54\
tormented by mistakes from which we've\
11:56\
repented\
11:57\
thinking of them as wounds that never\
11:59\
heal or be excessively apprehensive that\
12:02\
we might\
12:02\
stumble again we can assess our own\
12:07\
progress\
12:08\
we can know that the course of life that\
12:10\
we're pursuing\
12:12\
is according to god's will when we\
12:15\
do justly love mercy\
12:18\
and walk humbly with our god we\
12:21\
assimilate attributes\
12:24\
of heavenly father and jesus christ into\
12:26\
our character\
12:28\
and we love one another\
12:32\
when you do these things you will follow\
12:35\
the covenant path\
12:37\
and qualify to dwell with god in a state\
12:39\
of never-ending happiness\
12:42\
your souls will be infused with the\
12:44\
glory of god and with the light of\
12:46\
everlasting life\
12:48\
you will be filled with incomprehensible\
12:50\
joy\
12:52\
i testify that god lives and that jesus\
12:56\
is the christ our savior and redeemer\
13:00\
and lovingly and joyfully extends his\
13:04\
mercy to all\
13:06\
don't you love it in the name of jesus\
13:10\
christ\
13:18\
amen\
13:27\
you\
