two years ago\
0:03\
my youngest brother chad stepped through\
0:05\
the veil\
0:06\
his transition to the other side left a\
0:08\
hole in the heart of my sister-in-law\
0:10\
stephanie\
0:12\
their two small children braden and\
0:13\
bella as well as the rest of the family\
0:17\
we found comfort in the words of elder\
0:19\
neil anderson in general conference the\
0:21\
week before\
0:22\
chad died in the crucible of earthly\
0:25\
trials\
0:26\
patiently move forward and the savior's\
0:29\
healing\
0:30\
power will bring you light understanding\
0:33\
peace and hope we have faith in jesus\
0:37\
christ\
0:37\
we know we will join chad again but\
0:40\
losing his physical presence\
0:42\
hurts many have lost loved ones\
0:45\
it's hard to be patient and wait for the\
0:48\
time we will rejoin them\
0:50\
the year after he died we felt like a\
0:52\
dark cloud overshadowed us\
0:55\
we sought refuge in studying our\
0:56\
scriptures praying with more fervency\
0:59\
and attending the temple more frequently\
1:01\
the lines from this hymn capture our\
1:03\
feelings at the time\
1:05\
the date on is breaking the world is\
1:08\
awakening\
1:09\
the clouds of night's darkness are\
1:11\
fleeing away\
1:13\
our family determined that 2020 would be\
1:16\
a\
1:17\
refreshing year we were studying our\
1:19\
come follow me lesson in the new\
1:21\
testament book of james\
1:22\
in late november 2019 when a theme\
1:25\
revealed itself to us\
1:27\
james chapter 1 verse 2 reads my\
1:30\
brethren\
1:31\
counted all joy when you fall into many\
1:34\
afflictions\
1:35\
in our desire to open a new year a new\
1:38\
decade with joy\
1:40\
we decided that in 2020 we would\
1:43\
count it all joy we felt so strongly\
1:45\
about it\
1:46\
that last christmas we gifted our\
1:48\
siblings t-shirts\
1:50\
that said in bold letters counted all\
1:52\
joy\
1:53\
the year 2020 would surely be a year of\
1:56\
joy\
1:57\
and rejoicing well\
2:00\
here we are 2020 instead brought the\
2:03\
global covet 19 pandemic\
2:06\
civil unrest more natural disasters and\
2:09\
economic challenges\
2:11\
our heavenly father may be allowing us\
2:13\
time to reflect and consider our\
2:15\
understanding of patience and our\
2:18\
conscious decision\
2:19\
to choose joy the book of james has\
2:22\
since\
2:23\
taken on new meaning for us james\
2:26\
chapter 1 verses 3 and 4 continue\
2:29\
knowing this that the trying of your\
2:32\
faith worketh patience\
2:34\
but let patience have her perfect work\
2:37\
that ye may be perfect and entire\
2:40\
wanting nothing\
2:42\
in our efforts to find joy in the midst\
2:44\
of our trials we had forgotten\
2:46\
that having patience is the key to\
2:48\
letting those trials\
2:49\
work for our good king benjamin taught\
2:52\
to put off the natural man\
2:54\
and becometh a saint through the\
2:56\
atonement of christ the lord\
2:57\
and becometh as a child submissive meek\
3:01\
humble patient full of love\
3:04\
and willing to submit to all things\
3:07\
chapter six of preach my gospel teaches\
3:09\
key attributes of christ\
3:11\
that we can emulate patience is the\
3:14\
capacity to endure delay\
3:16\
trouble opposition or suffering without\
3:19\
becoming\
3:20\
angry frustrated or anxious it is the\
3:23\
ability to do god's will and accept his\
3:25\
timing\
3:26\
when you are patient you hold up under\
3:28\
pressure\
3:29\
and are able to face adversity calmly\
3:32\
and hopefully\
3:34\
patience perfect work may also be\
3:36\
illustrated in the life of one of\
3:38\
christ's early disciples\
3:39\
simon the canaanite the zealots were a\
3:42\
group of jewish nationalists who\
3:44\
strongly opposed roman\
3:46\
rule the zealot movement advocated\
3:48\
violence against their romans\
3:50\
the jewish collaborators and the\
3:52\
sadducees by raiding for provisions and\
3:54\
pursuing\
3:55\
other activities to aid their cause\
3:58\
simon the canaanite\
3:59\
was a zealot imagine simon trying to\
4:03\
coax the savior\
4:04\
into taking up arms lead a militant\
4:07\
group or create\
4:08\
chaos in jerusalem jesus taught\
4:12\
blessed are the meek for they shall\
4:14\
inherit the earth\
4:16\
blessed are the merciful for they shall\
4:19\
obtain mercy\
4:21\
blessed are the peacemakers for they\
4:24\
shall be called the children of god\
4:27\
simon may have embraced and advocated\
4:29\
his philosophy with zeal and passion\
4:32\
but the scriptures suggest that through\
4:34\
the influence and example of the savior\
4:37\
his focus changed his discipleship of\
4:40\
christ\
4:41\
became the central focus of his life's\
4:44\
efforts\
4:45\
as we make and keep covenants with god\
4:47\
the savior can help us\
4:49\
to be born again yea born of god\
4:52\
changed from a carnal and fallen state\
4:55\
to a state of righteousness\
4:57\
being redeemed of god becoming his sons\
5:00\
and daughters\
5:02\
of all the zealous social religious and\
5:04\
political endeavors of our day\
5:07\
let disciple of jesus christ be our most\
5:10\
pronounced\
5:11\
and affirming affiliation for where your\
5:14\
treasure is\
5:15\
there will your heart be also let us\
5:18\
also not forget\
5:20\
even after faithful disciples had done\
5:22\
the will of god they had need\
5:24\
of patience just as the trying of our\
5:28\
faith works patience within us\
5:30\
when we exercise patience our faith\
5:33\
increases\
5:34\
as our faith increases so does our joy\

9:41\
in the name of jesus he will answer us\
9:45\
