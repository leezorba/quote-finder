in his poetic hymn of praise\
0:04\
the psalmist declared o lord\
0:08\
thou has searched me and know me\
0:11\
thou knowest my down seeding and my\
0:13\
uprising\
0:15\
thou understand this my thoughts are far\
0:17\
off\
0:19\
thou composed my path and my lying down\
0:23\
and are acquainted with all my ways\
0:27\
in this poem semantic parallelism\
0:30\
the psalmist praises the lord's divine\
0:32\
attribute\
0:33\
of omniscience because he truly knows\
0:37\
every aspect of ourselves being aware\
0:40\
of all that is necessary for us in this\
0:43\
life\
0:44\
the savior invites us to seek him in\
0:46\
every thought\
0:48\
and follow him with all our heart\
0:51\
this gives us the promise that we can\
0:53\
walk in his light\
0:55\
and that his guidance prevents the\
0:57\
influence of darkness in our life\
1:00\
seeking christ in every thought and\
1:02\
following him with\
1:03\
our heart requires that we align\
1:07\
our mind and desires with his the\
1:10\
scriptures refer\
1:11\
to this alignment as standing fast in\
1:14\
the lord\
1:16\
this course of action implies that we\
1:18\
continually conduct our lives in harmony\
1:21\
with the gospel of christ and focus\
1:24\
daily\
1:24\
on everything that is good only them we\
1:28\
may achieve the peace of god\
1:30\
which passeth all understanding and\
1:32\
which\
1:33\
will keep our hearts and minds through\
1:35\
christ jesus\
1:37\
the savior himself instructed the elders\
1:39\
of the church\
1:40\
in february 1831 treasure these things\
1:44\
up in our hearts in your hearts and let\
1:48\
the solemnities of eternity rest upon\
1:51\
your minds\
1:53\
despite our continuous efforts to seek\
1:55\
out the lord\
1:57\
inappropriate thoughts may penetrate our\
1:59\
mind\
2:00\
when such thoughts are permitted and\
2:02\
even invited to stay\
2:04\
they can shape the desires of our heart\
2:06\
and lead us to what\
2:08\
we will become in this life and\
2:10\
eventually\
2:11\
to what will we will inherit for\
2:14\
eternity\
2:15\
elder neil a max will once emphasized\
2:18\
this principle by saying\
2:20\
desires determine the degradations in\
2:23\
outcomes\
2:24\
including why many are called but few\
2:26\
are chosen\
2:28\
our ancient and modern prophets have\
2:31\
constantly reminded us\
2:33\
to resist temptation in order to avoid\
2:36\
losing our\
2:36\
spiritual traction and becoming confused\
2:40\
disoriented and disillusioned in life\
2:44\
metaphorically speaking yielding to\
2:46\
temptation\
2:47\
is like approaching a magnet with a\
2:50\
metal object\
2:51\
the magnet invisible's force attracts\
2:54\
the metal\
2:55\
object and holds it tightly the magnet\
2:58\
loses its power\
3:00\
over it only when the metal object is\
3:03\
placed\
3:04\
far from it therefore\
3:07\
just as the magnet is unable to exercise\
3:10\
power over a faraway metal\
3:11\
object as we resist temptation\
3:15\
it fades away and loses its power over\
3:18\
our mind and heart\
3:19\
and consequently over our actions\
3:23\
this analogy reminds me of an experience\
3:26\
that a very faithful member of the\
3:28\
church\
3:29\
shared with me some time ago this member\
3:32\
told me that when\
3:34\
she awakened on a particular morning an\
3:37\
improper thought that she never had\
3:39\
experience before\
3:41\
unexpectedly enter her mind although it\
3:44\
caught her completely by\
3:46\
surprise she reacted against the\
3:48\
situation in a split second\
3:51\
saying to herself and to that thought\
3:54\
no and replaced it with\
3:57\
something good to divert her mind from\
4:00\
the unwelcome thought\
4:02\
she told me that as she exercised her\
4:04\
moral agency in righteousness\
4:07\
that negative involuntary thought\
4:09\
immediately disappeared\
4:11\
when moroni called upon the people to\
4:14\
believe in christ\
4:16\
and to repent he urged them to come unto\
4:19\
the savior with\
4:20\
all their hearts stripping themselves\
4:23\
from all uncleanness\
4:24\
furthermore moroni invited them to ask\
4:28\
god\
4:28\
with unbreakable determination that they\
4:31\
would not fall\
4:32\
into temptation applying these\
4:36\
principles in our lives requires more\
4:38\
than a mere belief\
4:40\
it also requires adjusting our minds and\
4:43\
hearts to these divine principles\
4:46\
such adjustment requires a daily and\
4:48\
constant\
4:49\
personal effort in addition to reliance\
4:52\
on the savior because our mortal\
4:54\
inclinations\
4:55\
will not disappear on their own fighting\
4:59\
against temptation takes a lifetime of\
5:01\
diligence and\
5:02\
faithfulness but please know\
5:05\
that the lord is ready to assist us in\
5:08\
our personal efforts\
5:10\
and promises remarkable blessings if we\
5:13\
endure\
5:14\
to the end during a particularly\
5:17\
difficult time when joseph smith and his\
5:19\
fellow prisoners\
5:21\
in liberty jail did not have freedom in\
5:23\
anything\
5:24\
except for their thoughts the lord\
5:27\
provided helpful counsel\
5:29\
and a promise to them that are extended\
5:32\
to all of us\
5:35\
let thy bowels house be full of charity\
5:38\
towards\
5:38\
all men and women and to the household\
5:42\
of faith\
5:43\
and let virtue garnish thy thoughts\
5:46\
unceasingly then shall thy confidence\
5:50\
wax is strong in the presence of god the\
5:53\
holy ghost\
5:54\
shall be thy conscious constant\
5:56\
companion\
5:57\
and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of\
6:00\
righteousness and truth\
6:03\
in doing so holy thoughts\
6:06\
will continuously adorn our minds and\
6:09\
pure desires will lead us\
6:11\
to righteous actions moroni also\
6:14\
reminded his people not to be consumed\
6:17\
by their lusts\
6:18\
the word lust refers to an intense\
6:20\
longing and improper desire for\
6:23\
something\
6:24\
it encompasses any dark thoughts or evil\
6:27\
desires\
6:28\
that cause an individual to focus on\
6:30\
selfish practices\
6:32\
or worldly possessions rather than\
6:35\
doing good being kind keeping the\
6:37\
commandments of god and so forth\
6:41\
it is often manifested through the most\
6:44\
carnal feelings of the soul the apostle\
6:47\
paul\
6:48\
identified some of these feelings such\
6:50\
as\
6:51\
uncleanness lasciviousness hatred\
6:55\
wrath strife envian and such like\
6:59\
besides all the evil aspects of lust\
7:03\
we cannot forget that the enemy uses it\
7:07\
as a secret and deceptive weapon against\
7:10\
us\
7:11\
when he tempt us to do something wrong\
7:14\
my beloved brothers and sisters i\
7:17\
testify that\
7:18\
as we rely upon the rock of salvation\
7:22\
the savior of our souls\
7:26\
and follow moroni's council\
7:31\
our ability to control our thoughts will\
7:33\
increase significantly\
7:35\
i can assure you that our spiritual\
7:38\
maturity will grow\
7:40\
at an increasing pace changing our heart\
7:44\
making us more like jesus christ\
7:47\
additionally the influence of the holy\
7:49\
ghost will be more intense\
7:51\
and continuous in our life then\
7:54\
the enemy's temptations little by little\
7:57\
will lose their power over us\
7:59\
resulting in a happier and more pure\
8:02\
and consecrated life for those who\
8:06\
for whatever reason fall into temptation\
8:09\
and are dwelling\
8:10\
upon unrighteous actions i assure you\
8:13\
that there is a way back\
8:15\
that there is hope in christ\
8:19\
a few years ago i had the opportunity to\
8:22\
visit with a dear member of the church\
8:24\
of jesus christ of latter-day saints\
8:27\
who went through a very difficult time\
8:29\
in his life\
8:30\
after committing a major transgression\
8:33\
when i first saw him i could see a\
8:36\
sadness in his eyes\
8:38\
accompanied by a brightness of hope in\
8:40\
his countenance\
8:42\
his very expression reflected a humble\
8:45\
and changed heart\
8:46\
he had been a dedicated christian and\
8:49\
had been\
8:50\
richly blessed by the lord however he\
8:53\
had\
8:54\
let a single improper thought invade his\
8:57\
mind\
8:58\
with them led to others as he steadily\
9:02\
became more and more permissive to these\
9:04\
thoughts\
9:05\
soon they took root in his mind and\
9:08\
began to grow deep in his heart\
9:11\
he eventually acted upon these unworthy\
9:14\
desires\
9:15\
which led him to make decisions against\
9:18\
everything that was most precious in his\
9:21\
life\
9:22\
he told me that if he had not given\
9:25\
place to that foolish\
9:27\
thought to begin with he would not have\
9:30\
become\
9:30\
vulnerable and susceptible to the\
9:33\
temptations of the enemy\
9:35\
temptations that brought so much sadness\
9:39\
in his life at least for a period of\
9:41\
time\
9:42\
fortunately like the prodigal son in the\
9:45\
famous parable\
9:47\
found in the gospel of luke he came to\
9:50\
himself\
9:51\
and woke up from that nightmare\
9:54\
he renewed his trust in the lord and\
9:57\
felt\
9:58\
true contrition and had the desire\
10:01\
to eventually return to the lord's fold\
10:05\
that day we both felt the savior's\
10:07\
redeeming love for us\
10:09\
at the end of our brief visit we were\
10:12\
both overcome\
10:15\
with emotion and to this day\
10:19\
i remember the resplendent joy\
10:22\
in his countenance when he left my\
10:25\
office\
10:27\
my dear friends when we resist the\
10:30\
little temptations\
10:32\
which often come unexpectedly in our\
10:34\
life\
10:35\
you we are better equipped to avoid\
10:37\
serious transgressions\
10:39\
as president spencer w kimball said\
10:42\
selden does\
10:43\
one enter into a deeper transgression\
10:46\
without first yielding to lesser ones\
10:49\
which open the door to the greater\
10:52\
a clean field does not suddenly become\
10:55\
weedy\
10:57\
while preparing to accomplish his divine\
11:00\
mission on earth\
11:01\
the savior jesus christ exemplified the\
11:04\
importance of\
11:05\
constantly resisting everything that\
11:08\
might\
11:08\
dissuade us from realizing our eternal\
11:11\
purpose\
11:12\
after several unsuccessful attacks by\
11:15\
the enemy\
11:16\
who attempted to divert him from his\
11:19\
mission\
11:20\
the savior categorically dismissed the\
11:23\
devil by saying\
11:25\
get the hands satan\
11:28\
then the devil liveth him\
11:31\
and behold angels came and ministered\
11:35\
unto him can you imagine\
11:38\
my brothers and sisters what would\
11:41\
happen if we were to derive\
11:43\
strength and courage from the savior and\
11:46\
say\
11:47\
no and get the hands to unvirtuous\
11:51\
thoughts\
11:52\
that very first moment they come into\
11:55\
our minds\
11:56\
what would be the impact on the desires\
11:59\
of our hearts\
12:00\
how would our resulting actions keep us\
12:03\
close to the savior\
12:05\
and allow the continued influence of the\
12:07\
holy ghost in our lives\
12:10\
i know that by following jesus example\
12:14\
we will avoid many tragedies and\
12:17\
undesirable behaviors\
12:19\
that might cause family problems and\
12:21\
disagreements\
12:23\
negative emotions and inclinations\
12:26\
perpetrating\
12:27\
injustices and abuses enslavement by\
12:30\
evil addictions and anything else\
12:34\
that would be against the lord's\
12:35\
commandments\
12:37\
in his historic and touching message\
12:40\
from april this year\
12:42\
our dear prophet president russell m\
12:44\
nelson\
12:45\
made a promise that all those who are\
12:48\
willing to hear him hear jesus christ\
12:52\
and obey his commandments we'll be\
12:55\
blessed with additional power to deal\
12:57\
with temptations\
12:59\
his struggles and weakness and that our\
13:02\
capacity to feel joy will increase\
13:05\
even during the increasing turbulence\
13:08\
current turbulence i testify to you\
13:13\
that the promises given by our dear\
13:15\
prophet are the promises given by the\
13:18\
savior himself\
13:20\
i invite all of us to hear him in every\
13:23\
thought\
13:24\
and follow him with all our heart in\
13:27\
order to\
13:27\
obtain the strength and courage to say\
13:30\
no\
13:31\
and get the hence to all the things that\
13:34\
might bring unhappiness into our life\
13:38\
if we do so i promise that the lord will\
13:42\
send an\
13:42\
added measure of his holy spirit to\
13:45\
strength\
13:46\
and comfort us and we may become\
13:49\
individuals\
13:51\
after the lord's own heart i bear my\
13:54\
witness\
13:55\
that jesus christ lives and that through\
13:58\
him\
13:59\
we may triumph over the enemy's evil\
14:02\
influences and qualify to live for\
14:05\
eternity with him\
14:07\
and in the presence of our beloved\
14:10\
father in heaven\
14:12\
i testify of these truths with\
14:15\
all my love for you and for our\
14:18\
beautiful savior\
14:19\
to whose name i give glory honor\
14:23\
and praise evermore i say these things\
14:27\
in the sacred name of jesus christ\
14:42\
amen\
14:47\
you\
