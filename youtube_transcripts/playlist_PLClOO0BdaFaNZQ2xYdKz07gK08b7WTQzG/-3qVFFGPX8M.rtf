not long after\
0:04\
arriving in salt lake valley the\
0:07\
latter-day saints\
0:08\
began building their holy temple\
0:12\
they felt they had finally found a place\
0:14\
where they could worship god\
0:16\
in peace and free from persecution\
0:19\
however\
0:20\
just as the temple foundation was\
0:22\
nearing completion\
0:24\
an army of united states soldiers\
0:26\
approached to forcibly install\
0:28\
a new governor because church leaders\
0:31\
did not know\
0:32\
how hostile the army would be brigham\
0:35\
young ordered the saints to evaluate\
0:38\
and evacuate and bury the temple\
0:41\
foundation\
0:43\
i'm sure some members of the church\
0:45\
wondered why their efforts to build\
0:47\
god's kingdom were constantly being\
0:49\
frustrated\
0:51\
eventually the danger passed and the\
0:53\
temple foundations were\
0:55\
excavated and inspected it was then that\
0:58\
the pioneer builders\
1:00\
discovered that many of the original\
1:02\
sandstones\
1:03\
had cracked making them unsuitable\
1:07\
as a foundation consequently brickham\
1:10\
replaced them with massive blocks of\
1:13\
credits\
1:14\
strong enough to support the walls of\
1:17\
the majestic salt lake temple\
1:19\
finally the saints could sing the hymn\
1:23\
how firm a foundation and know\
1:26\
their holy temple was built on a solid\
1:29\
foundation that would last\
1:31\
for generations this story can teach us\
1:34\
how god\
1:35\
uses adversity to bring about his\
1:38\
purposes\
1:40\
if this sounds familiar given the\
1:41\
circumstances in which we find ourselves\
1:44\
today\
1:44\
it's because it is i doubt there is a\
1:49\
person who hears my voice or reads my\
1:51\
words\
1:51\
who has not been affected by the\
1:54\
worldwide\
1:55\
pandemic to those who\
1:59\
mourn the loss of family and friends we\
2:02\
mourn with you we plead with heavenly\
2:05\
father to comfort\
2:07\
and console you the long-term\
2:10\
consequences of this virus go beyond\
2:13\
physical health\
2:15\
many families have lost incomes and are\
2:18\
threatened with hunger\
2:19\
uncertainty and apprehension we admire\
2:22\
the selfless efforts of so many to\
2:25\
prevent\
2:26\
the spread of this disease we are\
2:29\
humbled\
2:30\
by the quiet sacrifice and noble efforts\
2:32\
of those\
2:33\
who have risked their own safety to\
2:36\
assist\
2:37\
heal and support people in need our\
2:40\
hearts\
2:41\
are full of gratitude for your goodness\
2:44\
and compassion\
2:45\
we pray mightily that god will open the\
2:48\
windows of heaven\
2:50\
and fill your lives with god's eternal\
2:53\
blessings\
2:55\
there's still a lot of unknowns about\
2:58\
this virus\
3:00\
but if there's one thing i do know\
3:03\
this virus did not catch heavenly father\
3:06\
by surprise\
3:07\
he did not have to muster additional\
3:09\
battalions of angels call emergency\
3:12\
meetings or\
3:13\
divert resources from the world creation\
3:15\
division to handle\
3:17\
an unexpected need my message today\
3:21\
is that even though this pandemic is\
3:25\
not what we wanted or expected\
3:28\
god has prepared his children and his\
3:31\
church\
3:32\
for this time we will endure this\
3:36\
yes but we will do more than\
3:39\
simply grit our teeth hold on and\
3:42\
wait for things to return to the old\
3:44\
normal\
3:45\
we will move forward and we will be\
3:48\
better\
3:49\
as a result in a way wear seeds\
3:53\
and for seeds to reach their potential\
3:56\
they must be buried before they can\
3:59\
sprout\
4:00\
it is my witness that though at times we\
4:04\
may\
4:04\
feel buried by the trials of life\
4:07\
or surround surrounded by emotional\
4:10\
darkness\
4:12\
the love of god and the blessings of the\
4:15\
restored gospel of jesus christ\
4:17\
will bring something unimaginable\
4:21\
to spring forth every dispensation has\
4:24\
faced its times of\
4:26\
trial and hardship enoch and his people\
4:29\
lived in a time of\
4:30\
wickedness wars and bloodshed\
4:33\
but the lord came and dwelt\
4:36\
with his people he had something\
4:40\
unimaginable in mind for them he helped\
4:43\
them\
4:43\
establish zion a people of\
4:46\
one heart and one mind who dwelt in\
4:50\
righteousness young joseph the son of\
4:53\
jacob\
4:54\
was thrown into a pit sold into slavery\
4:57\
betrayed and abandoned\
4:59\
joseph must have wondered if god had\
5:02\
forgotten him\
5:03\
god had something unimaginable in mind\
5:06\
for joseph\
5:07\
he used this period of trial to\
5:09\
strengthen joseph's character\
5:11\
and put him in a position to save his\
5:14\
family\
5:15\
think of joseph smith a prophet while in\
5:18\
prison in liberty jail\
5:20\
how he bled for relief\
5:23\
for the suffering saints he must have\
5:26\
wondered how\
5:27\
zion could be established in those\
5:29\
circumstances\
5:31\
but the lord spoke peace to him\
5:34\
and the glorious revelation that\
5:36\
followed brought peace to the saints\
5:39\
and it continues to bring peace to you\
5:42\
and me how many times in the early years\
5:46\
of the church of jesus christ of\
5:47\
latter-day saints\
5:48\
did the saints despair and wonder\
5:52\
if god had forgotten them but through\
5:57\
persecutions perils and threats of\
6:00\
extermination the lord god of israel\
6:03\
had something else in mind for this\
6:06\
little flock\
6:07\
something unimaginable\
6:10\
what do we learn from these examples and\
6:13\
the hundreds of others in the scriptures\
6:16\
first the righteous are not given a free\
6:20\
pass\
6:21\
that allows them to avoid the valleys of\
6:24\
shadow we all must walk through\
6:27\
difficult times\
6:29\
for it is in these times of adversity\
6:31\
that we learn\
6:32\
principles that fortify our characters\
6:36\
and cause us to draw closer to god\
6:40\
second our heavenly father knows that we\
6:43\
suffer\
6:44\
and because we are his children\
6:48\
he will not abandon us\
6:51\
think of the compassionate one the\
6:53\
savior\
6:54\
who spends so much of his life\
6:57\
ministering to the sick\
6:58\
the lonely the doubting the despairing\
7:02\
do you think he is any less concerned\
7:06\
about\
7:06\
you today my dear friends\
7:10\
my beloved brothers and sisters\
7:13\
god will watch over and shepherd you\
7:16\
during these times of\
7:18\
uncertainty and fear he knows you he\
7:21\
hears your pleas\
7:22\
he is faithful and dependable he will\
7:26\
fulfill his promises\
7:30\
god has something unimaginable in mind\
7:32\
for you personally\
7:34\
and the church collectively a\
7:37\
marvelous work and a wonder\
7:41\
our best days are ahead of us not behind\
7:43\
us\
7:44\
this is why god gives us modern\
7:46\
revelation\
7:47\
without it life might feel like flying\
7:50\
in a holding pattern\
7:51\
waiting for the fog to lift so we can\
7:54\
land safely\
7:55\
the lord's purpose purposes for us are\
7:58\
much higher than that\
8:00\
because is this is the church of the\
8:03\
living christ\
8:05\
and because he directs his prophets\
8:08\
we are moving forward and upward to\
8:11\
places\
8:13\
we have never been to heights we can\
8:16\
hardly\
8:16\
imagine now this does not mean we won't\
8:20\
experience\
8:20\
turbulence in our flight through\
8:22\
mortality\
8:25\
it doesn't mean there won't be\
8:26\
unexpected instrument failures\
8:28\
mechanical malfunctions or serious\
8:31\
weather challenges\
8:32\
in fact things might get worse\
8:37\
before they get better as a fighter\
8:40\
pilot and airline captain i learned that\
8:42\
while i could not\
8:44\
choose the adversity i would encounter\
8:47\
during a flight\
8:49\
i could choose how i prepared\
8:53\
and how i reacted what is needed during\
8:57\
times of crisis\
8:58\
is calm and clear-headed trust\
9:02\
how do we do this we face the facts and\
9:06\
return to the fundamentals\
9:08\
to the basic gospel principles to what\
9:10\
matters\
9:11\
most you strengthen your private\
9:15\
religious\
9:15\
behavior like prayer and scripture study\
9:19\
and keeping god's commandments you make\
9:22\
the decisions based on best proven\
9:24\
practices\
9:26\
focus on the things you can do and not\
9:29\
on the things you cannot do you muster\
9:32\
your faith\
9:33\
and you listen for the guiding word of\
9:36\
the lord\
9:37\
and his prophet to lead you to safety\
9:41\
remember this is\
9:44\
the church of jesus christ\
9:48\
he is at the helm think of the many\
9:50\
inspired advancements that happened in\
9:52\
the past\
9:53\
decade alone to mention just a few\
9:56\
the segment was re-emphasized as center\
9:59\
of our sabbath worship\
10:01\
come follow me was provided as a\
10:03\
home-centered church-supported tool\
10:06\
to strengthen individuals and families\
10:09\
we began a higher and holier way\
10:12\
of ministering to all the use of\
10:15\
technology in sharing the gospel and\
10:17\
doing the lord's work has spread\
10:19\
throughout the church\
10:21\
even these general conference sessions\
10:24\
would not be possible without the\
10:25\
wonderful tools of technology\
10:28\
brothers and sisters with christ at the\
10:31\
helm\
10:32\
things will not only be all right they\
10:35\
will be\
10:36\
unimaginable the work of gathering\
10:39\
israel goes forward\
10:41\
at first it may have seemed that a\
10:44\
worldwide pandemic would\
10:46\
be a roadblock to the lord's work for\
10:49\
example\
10:50\
traditional methods of sharing the\
10:51\
gospel had not been possible\
10:53\
however the pandemic\
10:57\
is revealing new and more creative ways\
11:01\
of reaching out to the honest in heart\
11:04\
the work of gathering israel is\
11:06\
increasing in power and enthusiasm\
11:09\
hundreds and thousands of stars attacked\
11:11\
attest to this a good friend\
11:14\
living in beautiful norway wrote to\
11:17\
harriet and me\
11:18\
about a recent increase in baptisms\
11:21\
in locations where the church is small\
11:23\
she wrote\
11:25\
twix will become branches and branches\
11:28\
will become\
11:29\
warts in latvia a woman who had\
11:32\
discovered the church by clicking on an\
11:35\
internet and ad and was so excited to\
11:38\
learn about the gospel of jesus christ\
11:40\
that he showed up to her appointment an\
11:44\
hour early and before the missionaries\
11:46\
ended the first lesson\
11:47\
she asked for a date to be baptized\
11:51\
in eastern europe one woman who received\
11:54\
a call from\
11:55\
the missionaries exclaimed sisters\
11:58\
why haven't you called earlier i've been\
12:01\
waiting\
12:03\
many of our missionaries are busier than\
12:06\
ever\
12:07\
many are teaching more people than ever\
12:09\
there's an\
12:10\
increased connection between members and\
12:13\
missionaries\
12:15\
in the past we might have been so tied\
12:17\
to the\
12:18\
traditional approaches that it took a\
12:21\
pandemic\
12:22\
to open our eyes perhaps we were still\
12:25\
building with sandstone\
12:27\
when granite was already available\
12:31\
of necessity we are now learning how to\
12:35\
use\
12:35\
a variety of methods including\
12:38\
technology\
12:40\
to invite people in normal and natural\
12:43\
ways to\
12:44\
come and see and come and help and come\
12:47\
and belong this is the lord's work\
12:51\
he invites us to find his ways of doing\
12:54\
it\
12:55\
and they may differ differ from our past\
12:58\
experiences\
13:00\
this happened to simon peter and other\
13:03\
disciples who\
13:04\
went fishing on the sea of tiberias\
13:08\
that night they caught nothing but when\
13:11\
the morning came\
13:13\
jesus stood on the shore and he said\
13:16\
unto them\
13:18\
cast the net on the other side\
13:21\
of the ship and you shall find\
13:25\
they did cast their nets on the other\
13:28\
side\
13:29\
and were not able to draw it for the\
13:32\
multitude of\
13:33\
fishes god has revealed\
13:37\
and will continue to reveal his almighty\
13:40\
hand\
13:42\
the day will come when we will look back\
13:45\
and know that during this time of\
13:47\
adversity\
13:49\
god was helping us to find\
13:53\
the other way the better ways his ways\
13:57\
to build his kingdom on a firm\
14:00\
foundation i bear witness that this\
14:04\
is god's work and he will continue\
14:08\
to do many unimaginable things among his\
14:11\
children\
14:12\
