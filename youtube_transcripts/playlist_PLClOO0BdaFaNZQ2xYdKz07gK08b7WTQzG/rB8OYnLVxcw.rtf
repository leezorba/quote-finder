0:14\
and all their siblings this was not easy\
0:18\
the bride is the ninth of ten children\
0:21\
her nine siblings sat in order oldest to\
0:24\
youngest\
0:25\
socially distant of course the family\
0:28\
had sought to be good neighbors wherever\
0:30\
they lived\
0:31\
however one community had been\
0:33\
unwelcoming\
0:34\
because the bride's mother said their\
0:37\
families were their family were members\
0:39\
of the church of jesus christ of\
0:41\
latter-day saints\
0:42\
the family did everything to make\
0:44\
friends at school\
0:45\
contribute and be accepted but to no\
0:48\
avail\
0:49\
the family prayed and prayed hearts\
0:51\
would soften\
0:53\
one night the family felt their prayers\
0:55\
were answered though in a very\
0:57\
unexpected way their house caught fire\
1:00\
and burned to the ground but something\
1:03\
else happened\
1:04\
the fire softened their neighbors hearts\
1:07\
their neighbors in local school gathered\
1:09\
clothes shoes\
1:10\
others necessities needed by the family\
1:13\
who had lost\
1:14\
everything kindness opened understanding\
1:18\
it was not the way the family hoped or\
1:20\
expected their prayers to be answered\
1:22\
however they expressed gratitude for\
1:25\
what they\
1:26\
learned through hard experiences and\
1:28\
unexpected answers to heartfelt prayers\
1:32\
truly for those with faithful hearts and\
1:35\
eyes to see\
1:37\
the lord's tender mercies are manifest\
1:39\
amidst life's challenges\
1:41\
faithfully met challenges and sacrifice\
1:44\
do\
1:44\
bring the blessings of heaven in this\
1:48\
mortality we may lose or wait for some\
1:50\
things for a time\
1:52\
but in the end we will find what matters\
1:55\
most\
1:56\
that is his promise our 2020\
2:00\
bicentennial proclamation begins with\
2:02\
the profoundly inclusive promise that\
2:04\
god loves his children\
2:06\
in every nation of the world each of us\
2:10\
in every nation kindred tongue and\
2:12\
people\
2:12\
god promises covenants and invites us to\
2:15\
come partake of his abundant joy\
2:18\
and goodness god's love for all people\
2:22\
is affirmed throughout scripture that\
2:24\
love encompasses the\
2:25\
abrahamic covenant gathering his\
2:28\
scattered children\
2:29\
and his plan of happiness in the\
2:31\
household of faith\
2:33\
there to be no strangers no foreigners\
2:36\
no rich and poor no outside others\
2:40\
as fellow citizens with the saints we're\
2:43\
invited to change the world for the\
2:45\
better\
2:46\
from the inside out one person one\
2:48\
family\
2:49\
one neighborhood at a time this happens\
2:53\
when we live and share the gospel\
2:55\
early in this dispensation the prophet\
2:57\
joseph received a remarkable prophecy\
3:00\
that heavenly father desires everyone\
3:03\
everywhere\
3:04\
to discover god's love and experience\
3:07\
his power\
3:08\
to grow and change that prophecy was\
3:12\
received here\
3:13\
at the smith family log home in palmyra\
3:16\
new york\
3:17\
this second story bedroom occupies the\
3:19\
same 18 by 30 by 10 foot physical space\
3:23\
where moroni is a glorious messenger\
3:26\
from god\
3:27\
came to the young joseph on the evening\
3:29\
of september 21st\
3:30\
1823 the prophet joseph recounted\
3:35\
moroni said god had a work for me to do\
3:37\
and that my name should be had for good\
3:39\
and evil among\
3:40\
all nations kindreds and tongues\
3:44\
moroni said there was a book deposited\
3:46\
that the fullness of the everlasting\
3:48\
gospel was contained in it\
3:50\
here we pause we worship god the eternal\
3:54\
father\
3:54\
and his son jesus christ not the prophet\
3:58\
joseph\
3:58\
nor any mortal man or woman yet consider\
4:02\
how the prophecies\
4:03\
god gives his servants are fulfilled\
4:06\
some are fulfilled earlier some later\
4:09\
but all are fulfilled as we hearken to\
4:13\
the lord's spirit of prophecy\
4:15\
we can become in our own way part of the\
4:18\
fulfillment of his prophecies and\
4:20\
promises\
4:21\
part of the gospel blessing the world\
4:25\
in 1823 joseph was an\
4:28\
unknown 17 year old teenage boy living\
4:30\
in an obscure village\
4:32\
in a newly independent country unless it\
4:35\
were true\
4:36\
how would he imagine to say he would be\
4:38\
an instrument in god's\
4:40\
work and translate by god's gift and\
4:43\
power\
4:44\
sacred scripture that would become known\
4:46\
everywhere\
4:47\
yet because it is true\
4:50\
you and i can witness that prophecy\
4:52\
being fulfilled\
4:54\
even as we're invited to help bring it\
4:56\
to pass\
