you know the lord does not ask our\
0:03\
aaronic priesthood youth to do\
0:04\
everything\
0:05\
but what he does ask is awe-inspiring\
0:09\
a few years ago our little family went\
0:11\
through what many families face in this\
0:13\
fallen world\
0:14\
our youngest son tanner christian lund\
0:17\
contracted cancer\
0:19\
he was an incredible soul as\
0:21\
nine-year-olds tend to be\
0:23\
he was hilariously mischievous and at\
0:26\
the same time\
0:27\
stunningly spiritually aware imp and\
0:30\
angel\
0:31\
naughty and nice when he was little\
0:34\
and was every day bewildering us with\
0:36\
his shenanigans we wondered\
0:38\
if he was going to grow up to be the\
0:39\
prophet or a bank robber\
0:42\
either way it seemed that he was going\
0:44\
to leave a mark on the world\
0:46\
and then he became desperately ill\
0:49\
over the next three years modern\
0:50\
medicine employed heroic measures\
0:52\
including\
0:53\
two bone marrow transplants where he\
0:56\
contracted pneumonia requiring him to\
0:58\
spend 10 weeks\
1:00\
unconscious on a ventilator miraculously\
1:04\
he recovered for a short time but then\
1:07\
his cancer returned\
1:09\
shortly before he passed away tanner's\
1:11\
disease had invaded his bones and\
1:14\
even with strong pain medications still\
1:17\
he hurt\
1:18\
he could barely get out of bed one\
1:20\
sunday morning his mom\
1:22\
colleen came into his room to check on\
1:24\
him before the family left\
1:26\
for church she was surprised to see that\
1:29\
he had somehow gotten himself dressed\
1:31\
and was sitting on the edge of his bed\
1:33\
painfully struggling with a button to\
1:36\
button his shirt\
1:38\
colleen sat down by him tanner she said\
1:41\
are you sure you're strong enough to go\
1:44\
to church\
1:46\
maybe you should stay home and rest\
1:47\
today he stared at the floor\
1:50\
he was a deacon he had a quorum and he\
1:53\
had an assignment\
1:56\
i'm supposed to pass the sacrament today\
2:00\
well i'm sure somebody could do that for\
2:02\
you\
2:04\
yes he said but i see how people look at\
2:07\
me\
2:08\
when i pass the sacrament i think it\
2:11\
helps them\
2:13\
so colleen helped him button his shirt\
2:16\
and tie his tie\
2:17\
and they drove to church clearly\
2:20\
something important was happening\
2:22\
i came to church from an earlier meeting\
2:24\
and so was surprised to see tanner\
2:26\
sitting on the deacon's row\
2:28\
colleen quietly told me why he was there\
2:30\
and what he had said\
2:31\
it helps people and so i watched as the\
2:35\
deacon stepped to the sacrament table\
2:37\
he leaned gently against another deacon\
2:39\
as the priest passed them the bread\
2:41\
trays\
2:42\
and then tanner shuffled to his\
2:44\
appointed place and took hold at the end\
2:46\
of the pew to steady himself\
2:48\
as he presented the sacrament it seemed\
2:51\
that\
2:52\
every eye in the chapel was on him moved\
2:54\
by his struggle as he did his simple\
2:56\
part\
2:57\
somehow tanner expressed a silent sermon\
3:00\
as he solemnly\
3:01\
haltingly moved from row to row his bald\
3:04\
head moist with perspiration\
3:07\
representing the savior in the way that\
3:10\
deacons do\
3:11\
his once indomitable deacon's body was\
3:13\
itself a little bruised and broken and\
3:16\
torn\
3:16\
willingly suffering to serve by bearing\
3:19\
the emblems of the savior's atonement\
3:21\
into our lives\
3:24\
seeing how he had come to think about\
3:26\
being a deacon\
3:27\
made us think differently too about the\
3:30\
sacrament\
3:31\
about the savior and about deacons and\
3:34\
teachers and priests\
3:36\
i wonder at the unspoken miracle that it\
3:38\
impelled him\
3:39\
that morning to respond so bravely to\
3:42\
that still small\
3:43\
call to serve and about the strength and\
3:45\
capacities of all of our emergent youth\
3:48\
as they push themselves to respond to a\
3:50\
prophet's call\
3:51\
to enlist in god's battalions and join\
3:54\
in the work of salvation and exaltation\
3:57\
every time a deacon holds a sacrament\
3:59\
tray we are reminded of the sacred\
4:02\
story of the last supper of gethsemane\
4:05\
of calvary\
4:06\
and of the garden tomb when the savior\
4:09\
said to his apostles\
4:11\
this do in remembrance of me he was also\
4:14\
speaking through the ages to each of us\
4:16\
he was speaking of the unending miracle\
4:18\
that he would provide\
4:20\
as future deacons teachers and priests\
4:22\
would present his emblems and\
4:24\
invite his children to accept his\
4:26\
atoning gift all of the sacramental\
4:29\
symbols point us to that gift\
4:31\
we contemplate the bread that he once\
4:33\
broke and the bread the priests\
4:35\
before us in turn now are now breaking\
4:38\
we think of the meaning of the liquid\
4:41\
consecrated then\
4:42\
and now as the sacrament prayers\
4:44\
solemnly passed from the mouths of young\
4:46\
priests\
4:47\
into our hearts and into the heavens\
4:50\
renewing\
4:51\
covenants that connected us to the very\
4:54\
powers of christ's salvation\
4:56\
we may think about what it means when a\
4:58\
deacon carries the sacred emblems to us\
5:01\
standing as he does where jesus would\
5:03\
stand if he were there\
5:05\
offering to lift our burdens and our\
5:07\
pain\
5:08\
fortunately young men and women do not\
5:11\
have to get sick to discover\
5:13\
joy and purpose in serving the savior\
5:16\
elder david a bednar\
5:17\
has taught that to grow and become as\
5:20\
missionaries are\
5:21\
we should do what missionaries do and\
5:23\
then line upon line and precept upon\
5:25\
precept we can gradually\
5:27\
become the missionary the savior expects\
5:29\
well likewise if we desire\
5:31\
to be like jesus we should do what jesus\
5:34\
does\
5:36\
and in one astonishing sentence the lord\
5:38\
explains what it is that he does\
5:40\
he said for behold this is my work and\
5:44\
my glory to bring to pass the\
5:45\
immortality\
5:47\
and eternal eternal life of man the\
5:50\
savior's mission has always\
5:52\
and forever been to serve his father by\
5:55\
saving his children\
5:56\
and the surest way to find joy in this\
5:59\
life\
6:00\
is to join christ in helping others this\
6:03\
is a simple truth that inspired the\
6:05\
children and youth program\
6:07\
all children and youth activities and\
6:09\
all children and youth teachings are\
6:10\
about helping young people\
6:12\
become more like jesus by joining with\
6:14\
him in his work of salvation and\
6:16\
exaltation\
6:18\
children and youth is a tool to help\
6:20\
every primary child\
6:22\
and youth to grow in discipleship and\
6:24\
gain a faith-filled vision of what the\
6:26\
way of happiness looks like\
6:28\
they can come to anticipate and yearn\
6:30\
for the way stations and signposts\
6:33\
along the covenant path where they will\
6:35\
be baptized and confirmed with the gift\
6:37\
of the holy ghost and soon\
6:39\
belong to quorums and young women\
6:41\
classes where they will feel the joy of\
6:43\
helping others through a succession of\
6:45\
christ-like acts of service\
6:47\
they'll set goals large and small that\
6:49\
will bring balance to their lives as\
6:51\
they become more like the savior\
6:53\
for the strength of youth conferences\
6:55\
and magazines the friend\
6:57\
and the gospel living app will help\
6:59\
center them in finding joy in christ\
7:01\
they will anticipate the blessings of\
7:03\
holding limited use temple recommends\
7:06\
and feel the spirit of elijah through\
7:07\
the influence of the holy ghost\
7:09\
as they pursue the blessings of the\
7:11\
temple and family history\
7:13\
they will be guided by patriarchal\
7:15\
blessings\
7:17\
in time they will see themselves going\
7:19\
into temples to be endowed with power\
7:22\
and find joy there as they are eternally\
7:24\
connected\
7:26\
come what may with their families\
7:29\
against the headwinds of pandemic and\
7:32\
calamity\
7:33\
bringing about the full promise of the\
7:35\
new children and youth program\
7:37\
is still a work in progress but there is\
7:40\
urgency\
7:41\
our youth cannot wait for the world to\
7:43\
write itself before they come to know\
7:45\
the savior\
7:46\
some are making decisions even now that\
7:49\
they would not make if they understood\
7:50\
their true identities\
7:52\
and his and so the urgent call from\
7:55\
god's battalions in faithful training\
7:58\
is for all hands on deck moms and dads\
8:01\
your sons need you to support them now\
8:03\
as passionately as\
8:04\
ever you have in the past when they have\
8:07\
been about lesser things like badges and\
8:09\
pens\
8:10\
mothers and fathers priesthood and young\
8:12\
women leaders\
8:13\
if your youth are struggling children\
8:15\
and youth will help to bring them to the\
8:17\
savior\
8:18\
and the savior will bring them peace\
8:21\

8:22\

8:24\

8:27\

8:31\
