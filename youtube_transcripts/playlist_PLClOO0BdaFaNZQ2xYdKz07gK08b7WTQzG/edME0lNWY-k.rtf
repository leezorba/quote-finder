what a magnificent world we live in\
0:03\
and share home to a great diversity of\
0:06\
peoples\
0:07\
languages customs and histories spread\
0:10\
out over hundreds of countries and\
0:11\
thousands of groups\
0:12\
each rich in culture mankind has much to\
0:16\
be proud of and to celebrate\
0:18\
but though learned behavior those things\
0:20\
to which we are exposed by the cultures\
0:23\
we grow up in\
0:24\
can serve as a great strength in our\
0:26\
lives it can also at times become a\
0:28\
significant obstacle\
0:30\
it may seem that culture is so heavily\
0:33\
embedded in our thinking and behavior\
0:35\
that it is impossible to change it is\
0:38\
after all much of what we feel\
0:39\
defines us and from which we feel a\
0:42\
sense of identity\
0:43\
it can be such a strong influence that\
0:46\
we can fail to see the man-made\
0:48\
weaknesses or flaws\
0:49\
in our own cultures resulting in a\
0:51\
reluctance\
0:52\
to throw off some of the traditions of\
0:54\
our fathers\
0:56\
and fixation on one's cultural identity\
1:00\
may lead to the rejection of worthwhile\
1:03\
even godly ideas attributes and behavior\
1:07\
i knew a wonderful gentleman not too\
1:09\
many years ago who helps to illustrate\
1:11\
this universal principle of cultural\
1:13\
myopia\
1:15\
i first met him in singapore when i was\
1:17\
assigned to be his family's home teacher\
1:19\
a distinguished professor of sanskrit\
1:21\
and tamil\
1:22\
he hailed from the south of india his\
1:25\
wonderful\
1:26\
wife and two sons were members of the\
1:27\
church but he had never joined\
1:30\
nor listened much to the teachings of\
1:32\
the gospel\
1:33\
he was happy with the way his wife and\
1:35\
sons were developing\
1:36\
and supported them fully in their\
1:38\
undertakings and church responsibilities\
1:41\
when i offered to teach him the\
1:42\
principles of the gospel\
1:44\
and share our beliefs with him he\
1:46\
initially balked\
1:48\
it took me a while to figure out why he\
1:51\
felt\
1:52\
that by so doing he would become a\
1:53\
traitor to his past\
1:55\
his people and his history to his way of\
1:58\
thinking\
1:58\
he would be denying everything his\
2:00\
family had taught him to be\
2:02\
his very indian heritage over the next\
2:05\
few months we were able to talk about\
2:07\
these issues\
2:08\
i was odd though not surprised by how\
2:11\
the gospel of jesus christ was able to\
2:13\
open his eyes\
2:14\
to a different viewpoint in most\
2:17\
man-made cultures there is found both\
2:20\
good and bad\
2:21\
constructive and destructive many of our\
2:24\
world's problems\
2:26\
are a direct result of clashes between\
2:29\
those of differing ideas and customs\
2:31\
arriving from their culture but\
2:34\
virtually all conflict\
2:36\
and chaos would quickly fade if the\
2:38\
world would only accept\
2:39\
its original culture the one we all\
2:42\
possessed\
2:43\
not so very long ago this culture dates\
2:46\
back to our pre-mortal existence\
2:48\
it was the culture of adam and enoch it\
2:51\
was the culture\
2:52\
founded on the savior's teachings in the\
2:54\
meridian of time\
2:55\
and it is available to all women and men\
2:58\
once again in our day\
3:00\
it is unique it is the greatest of all\
3:03\
cultures\
3:04\
and comes from the great plan of\
3:05\
happiness authored by god\
3:07\
and championed by christ it unites\
3:10\
rather than divides it heals rather than\
3:13\
harms\
3:15\
the gospel of jesus christ teaches us\
3:17\
that there is purpose in life\
3:19\
our being here is not just some big\
3:21\
cosmic accident or mistake\
3:24\
we are here for a reason this culture\
3:27\
is grounded in the testimony that our\
3:29\
heavenly father exists\
3:31\
that he is real and loves each one of us\
3:34\
individually\
3:35\
we are his work and his glory it\
3:38\
espouses the concept of equal worth\
3:41\
there is no recognition of caste or\
3:43\
class\
3:44\
we are after all brothers and sisters\
3:47\
spirit children of our heavenly parents\
3:49\
literally there is no prejudice or\
3:52\
us versus them mentality in the greatest\
3:55\
of all cultures\
3:56\
we are all us we are all them\
4:01\
we believe that we are responsible and\
4:04\
accountable for ourselves\
4:06\
each other the church and our world\
4:09\
charity true christ-like caring is the\
4:12\
bedrock of this culture\
4:14\
we feel real concerned for the needs of\
4:16\
our fellow man\
4:17\
temporal and spiritual and act on those\
4:20\
feelings\
4:21\
this dispels prejudice and hatred\
4:24\
we enjoy a culture of revelation\
4:26\
centered on the word of god\
4:28\
as received by the prophets and\
4:30\
personally verifiable\
4:31\
to each one of us through the holy ghost\
4:34\
all humankind\
4:35\
can know the will and mind of god\
4:39\
this culture champions the principle of\
4:41\
agency\
4:42\
the ability to choose is extremely\
4:44\
important for our development\
4:46\
and our happiness it is a culture of\
4:49\
learning and study\
4:50\
we seek knowledge and wisdom and the\
4:52\
best in all things\
4:54\
it is a culture of faith and obedience\
4:57\
faith in jesus christ\
4:58\
is the first principle of our culture\
5:00\
and obedience to his teachings and\
5:02\
commandments\
5:03\
is the outcome these give rise to\
5:06\
self-mastery\
5:08\
it is a culture of prayer we believe\
5:10\
that god will not only hear us\
5:12\
but also help us it is a culture of\
5:15\
covenants and ordinances\
5:16\
high moral standards sacrifice\
5:19\
forgiveness and repentance\
5:21\
and the caring for the temple of our\
5:23\
bodies all of these witness\
5:25\
our commitment to god it is a culture\
5:28\
governed by the priesthood\
5:30\
the authority to act in god's name the\
5:32\
power of god to bless his children\
5:35\
it edifies and enables individuals to be\
5:38\
better people\
5:40\
leaders mothers fathers and companions\
5:43\
and it sanctifies the home true miracles\
5:47\
abound\
5:47\
in this the oldest of all cultures\
5:50\
wrought by faith in jesus christ\
5:52\
the power of the priesthood prayer\
5:54\
self-improvement\
5:56\
true conversion and forgiveness\
5:59\
it is a culture of missionary work the\
6:02\
worth of souls is great\
6:05\
in the culture of christ women are\
6:07\
elevated to their proper and eternal\
6:09\
status\
6:10\
they are not subservient to men as in\
6:12\
many cultures in today's world\
6:14\
but full and equal partners here and in\
6:17\
the world to come\
6:19\
culture sanctions the sanctity of the\
6:21\
family\
6:23\
the family is the basic unit of eternity\
6:26\
the perfection of the family is worth\
6:28\
any sacrifice\
6:29\
because as has been taught no other\
6:32\
success can compensate for failure in\
6:34\
the home\
6:35\
the home is where our best work is done\
6:38\
and where our greatest happiness\
6:39\
is attained in the culture of christ\
6:42\
there is perspective\
6:44\
and eternal focus and direction\
6:47\
this culture is concerned with things of\
6:49\
lasting worth\
6:51\
it comes from the gospel of jesus christ\
6:53\
which is eternal\
6:55\
and explains the why what and where of\
6:57\
our existence\
6:59\
it is inclusive not exclusive\
7:02\
because this culture results from the\
7:04\
application of our savior's teachings\
7:07\
it helps provide a healing balm of which\
7:10\
our world\
7:11\
is in such a desperate need\
7:14\
what a blessing it is to be part of this\
7:18\
grand\
7:19\
and noble way of life to be part of this\
7:22\
culture\
7:24\
the greatest of all will require change\
7:27\
the prophets have taught that it is\
7:29\
necessary\
7:30\
to leave behind anything in our old\
7:32\
cultures that is inconsistent with the\
7:34\
culture of christ\
7:36\
but that doesn't mean we have to leave\
7:37\
behind everything\
7:39\
the prophets have also emphasized that\
7:41\
we are invited one in all\
7:43\
to bring our faith and talents and\
7:45\
knowledge all that is good in our lives\
7:47\
and our individual cultures with us\
7:50\
and let the church add to it through the\
7:52\
message\
7:53\
of the gospel the church of jesus christ\
7:56\
of latter-day saints is hardly a western\
7:58\
society\
7:59\
or an american cultural phenomenon it is\
8:02\
an international church\
8:04\
as it was always meant to be new members\
8:08\
from around the world bring richness\
8:11\
diversity and excitement into our\
8:13\
ever-growing family\
8:15\
latter-day saints everywhere still\
8:17\
celebrate and honor their own heritage\
8:19\
and heroes\
8:20\
but now they are also part of something\
8:22\
far grander\
8:24\
the culture of christ helps us to see\
8:26\
ourselves as we really are\
8:28\
and when we're when seen through the\
8:30\
lens of eternity tempered with\
8:32\
righteousness\
8:33\
it serves to increase our ability to\
8:35\
fulfill\
8:36\
the great plan of happiness so what\
8:40\
happened to my friend\
8:41\
well he was taught the lessons and\
8:43\
joined the church\
8:44\
his family has since been sealed for\
8:46\
time and all eternity\
8:48\
in the sydney temple he has given up\
8:51\
little\
8:52\
and gained the potential for everything\
8:56\
he discovered that he can still\
8:58\
celebrate his history\
9:00\
still be proud of his ancestry his music\
9:03\
and dance and literature\
9:04\
his food his land and its people\
9:07\
he has found that there is no problem\
9:10\
incorporating the best of his local\
9:12\
culture\
9:13\
into the greatest of all cultures\
9:16\
he discovered that bringing that which\
9:18\
is consistent with truth and\
9:20\
righteousness from his old life\
9:22\
into his new one serves only to enhance\
9:24\
his fellowship with the saints\
9:26\
and to assist in uniting all as one in\
9:29\
the society of heaven\
9:31\
we can indeed all cherish the best of\
9:34\
our individual earthly cultures\
9:36\
and still be full participants in the\
9:39\
oldest culture of them all\
9:41\
the original the eternal culture that\
9:44\
comes from the gospel\
9:45\
of jesus christ what a marvelous\
9:49\
heritage\
9:51\
we all share in the name of jesus christ\
10:02\
amen\
10:09\
you\
