My dear brothers and\
sisters, family relationships\
0:06\
can be some of\
the most rewarding\
0:08\
yet challenging\
experiences we encounter.\
0:12\
Many of us have faced\
a fracture of some sort\
0:15\
within our families.\
0:17\
Such a fracture developed\
between two heroes\
0:21\
of the Restoration of the\
Church of Jesus Christ\
0:24\
in these latter days.\
0:25\
Parley and Orson Pratt were\
brothers, early converts,\
0:29\
and ordained Apostles.\
0:31\
Each faced a trial of\
faith but came through\
0:34\
with an unshakable testimony.\
0:37\
Both sacrificed and contributed\
greatly for the cause of truth.\
0:42\
During the Nauvoo era,\
their relationship\
0:45\
became strained, culminating in\
a heated, public confrontation\
0:50\
in 1846.\
0:52\
A deep and prolonged\
rift developed.\
0:55\
Parley initially wrote to\
Orson to resolve the rift,\
0:59\
but Orson did not reply.\
1:02\
Parley gave up, feeling that\
correspondence was over forever\
1:07\
unless initiated by Orson.\
1:11\
Several years later,\
in March 1853,\
1:15\
Orson learned about a\
project to publish a book\
1:18\
on the descendants of William\
Pratt, the brothers' earliest\
1:23\
American ancestor.\
1:24\
Orson began to weep\
"like a little child"\
1:28\
as he glimpsed this treasure\
trove of family history.\
1:31\
His heart melted,\
and he determined\
1:34\
to repair the breach\
with his brother.\
1:37\
Orson wrote to Parley,\
"Now my dear brother,\
1:40\
there are none among all the\
descendants of our ancestor,\
1:45\
Lieut[enant] William Pratt,\
who have so deep an interest\
1:49\
in searching out his\
descendants as ourselves."\
1:53\
Orson was one of the\
first to understand\
1:56\
that Latter-day Saints\
have an obligation\
1:59\
to research and compile\
family histories\
2:01\
so that we can perform vicarious\
ordinances for our ancestors.\
2:06\
His letter continued: "We know\
that the God of our fathers has\
2:11\
had a hand in this. ...\
2:14\
I will beg pardon for having\
been so backward in writing\
2:18\
to you. ...\
2:19\
I hope you will forgive me."\
2:22\
Despite their\
unshakable testimonies,\
2:25\
their love for their\
ancestors was the catalyst\
2:29\
to heal a rift, mend a hurt,\
and seek and extend forgiveness.\
2:36\
When God directs\
us to do one thing,\
2:38\
He often has many\
purposes in mind.\
2:42\
Family history and temple\
work is not only for the dead\
2:46\
but blesses the living as well.\
2:49\
For Orson and Parley, it turned\
their hearts to each other.\
2:53\
Family history and temple\
work provided the power\
2:58\
to heal that which\
needed healing.\
3:02\
As Church members, we do\
have a divinely appointed\
3:05\
responsibility to\
seek out our ancestors\
3:08\
and compile family histories.\
3:10\
This is far more than\
an encouraged hobby,\
3:13\
because the ordinances\
of salvation\
3:16\
are necessary for all\
of God's children.\
3:19\
We are to identify\
our own ancestors who\
3:22\
died without receiving the\
ordinances of salvation.\
3:25\
We can perform the ordinances\
vicariously in temples,\
3:29\
and our ancestors may choose\
to accept the ordinances.\
3:33\
We are also encouraged to\
help ward and stake members\
3:36\
with their family names.\
3:38\
It is breathtakingly amazing\
that through family history\
3:42\
and temple work, we can\
help to redeem the dead.\
3:48\
But as we participate in family\
history and temple work today,\
3:52\
we also lay claim to\
"healing" blessings promised\
3:57\
by prophets and apostles.\
3:59\
These blessings are also\
breathtakingly amazing\
4:02\
because of their\
scope, specificity,\
4:06\
and consequence in mortality.\
4:09\
This long list includes\
these blessings:\
4:13\
increased understanding\
of the Savior\
4:16\
and His atoning\
sacrifice; increased\
4:20\
influence of the Holy Ghost\
to feel strength and direction\
4:23\
for our own lives; increased\
faith so that conversion\
4:27\
to the Savior becomes\
deep and abiding;\
4:30\
increased ability and\
motivation to learn\
4:33\
and repent because of an\
understanding of who we are,\
4:37\
where we come from, and\
a clearer vision of where\
4:40\
we are going;\
increased refining,\
4:43\
sanctifying, and moderating\
influences in our hearts;\
4:47\
increased joy through\
an increased ability\
4:50\
to feel the love of the Lord;\
increased family blessings,\
4:55\
no matter our current, past,\
or future family situation\
5:00\
or how imperfect our\
family tree may be;\
5:04\
increased love and\
appreciation for ancestors\
5:07\
and living relatives so\
we no longer feel alone;\
5:12\
increased power to discern that\
which needs healing and thus,\
5:16\
with the Lord's\
help, serve others;\
5:19\
increased protection\
from temptations\
5:22\
and the intensifying\
influence of the adversary;\
5:25\
and increased assistance\
to mend troubled, broken,\
5:31\
or anxious hearts and\
make the wounded whole.\
5:37\
If you have prayed for\
any of these blessings,\
5:41\
participate in family\
history and temple work.\
5:45\
As you do so, your\
prayers will be answered.\
5:49\
When ordinances are performed\
on behalf of the deceased,\
5:53\
God's children on\
earth are healed.\
5:56\
No wonder President\
Russell M. Nelson,\
5:59\
in his first message as\
President of the Church,\
6:02\
declared, "Your worship in\
the temple and your service\
6:06\
there for your\
ancestors will bless you\
6:10\
with increased personal\
revelation and peace\
6:13\
and will fortify your commitment\
to stay on the covenant path."\
6:19\
An earlier prophet\
also foresaw blessings\
6:21\
for both the living\
and the dead.\
6:24\
A heavenly messenger\
showed Ezekiel\
6:27\
a vision of a temple with\
water gushing out of it.\
6:31\
Ezekiel was told:\
6:33\
"These waters issue out ...\
and go down into the desert,\
6:37\
and go into the [dead] sea ...\
, [and] the waters shall be\
6:40\
healed.\
6:41\
"And it shall come to pass,\
that every thing that liveth,\
6:44\
which moveth, whithersoever the\
rivers shall come, shall live:\
6:47\
... for they shall be healed;\
and every thing shall live\
6:51\
whither the river cometh."\
6:54\
Two characteristics of\
the water are noteworthy.\
6:57\
First, though the small\
stream had no tributaries,\
7:01\
it grew into a mighty river,\
becoming wider and deeper\
7:06\
the farther it flowed.\
7:07\
Something similar happens\
with the blessings\
7:10\
that flow from the\
temple as individuals\
7:13\
are sealed as families.\
7:15\
Meaningful growth occurs\
going backward and forward\
7:19\
through the generations\
as sealing ordinances weld\
7:22\
families together.\
7:25\
Second, the river renewed\
everything that it touched.\
7:29\
The blessings of\
the temple likewise\
7:32\
have a stunning\
capacity to heal.\
7:35\
Temple blessings can heal\
hearts and lives and families.\
7:43\
Let me illustrate.\
7:44\
In 1999 a young man named Todd\
collapsed from a ruptured blood\
7:49\
vessel in his brain.\
7:51\
Although Todd and his family\
were members of the Church,\
7:54\
their activity\
had been sporadic,\
7:57\
and none had experienced\
the blessings of the temple.\
8:00\
On the last night\
of Todd's life,\
8:03\
his mother, Betty, sat at\
his bedside stroking his hand\
8:08\
and said, "Todd, if you\
really do have to go,\
8:12\
I promise I'll see to it that\
your temple work gets done."\
8:17\
The next morning, Todd\
was declared brain dead.\
8:20\
Surgeons transplanted\
Todd's heart\
8:23\
into my patient, a remarkable\
individual named Rod.\
8:28\
A few months after\
the transplant,\
8:30\
Rod learned the identity\
of his heart donor's family\
8:33\
and began to\
correspond with them.\
8:36\
About two years later,\
Todd's mother, Betty,\
8:40\
invited Rod to be present\
when she went to the temple\
8:43\
for the first time.\
8:45\
Rod and Betty\
first met in person\
8:48\
in the celestial room of\
the St. George Utah Temple.\
8:53\
Sometime thereafter, Todd's\
father--Betty's husband--died.\
8:57\
A couple of years\
later, Betty invited\
8:59\
Rod to vicariously represent\
her deceased son in receiving\
9:04\
his temple ordinances.\
9:07\
Rod gratefully did\
so, and the proxy work\
9:10\
culminated in a sealing room\
of the St. George Utah Temple.\
9:14\
Betty was sealed to\
her deceased husband,\
9:17\
kneeling across the altar\
from her grandson who\
9:20\
served as proxy.\
9:22\
Then, with tears\
streaming down her cheeks,\
9:25\
she beckoned for Rod to\
join them at the altar.\
9:29\
Rod knelt beside\
them, acting as proxy\
9:33\
for her son, Todd,\
whose heart was still\
9:36\
beating inside Rod's chest.\
9:38\
Rod's heart donor, Todd, was\
then sealed to his parents\
9:43\
for all eternity.\
9:44\
Todd's mother had\
kept the promise\
9:48\
she made to her dying\
son years before.\
9:52\
But the story doesn't end there.\
9:54\
Fifteen years after\
his heart transplant,\
9:57\
Rod became engaged to\
be married and asked\
10:00\
me to perform the sealing\
in the Provo Utah Temple.\
10:04\
On the wedding day, I met with\
Rod and his marvelous bride,\
10:07\
Kim, in a room adjacent\
to the sealing room,\
10:11\
where their families and\
closest friends were waiting.\
10:14\
After briefly visiting\
with Rod and Kim,\
10:17\
I asked if they\
had any questions.\
10:20\
Rod said, "Yes.\
10:21\
My donor family is here, and\
they would love to meet you."\
10:25\
I was caught off guard and\
asked, "You mean they're here?\
10:29\
Right now?"\
10:31\
Rod replied, "Yes."\
10:33\
I stepped around the corner\
and called the family out\
10:36\
of the sealing room.\
10:37\
Betty, her daughter, and\
son-in-law joined us.\
10:40\
Rod greeted Betty with a\
hug, thanked her for coming,\
10:45\
and then introduced me to her.\
10:47\
Rod said, "Betty,\
this is Elder Renlund.\
10:50\
He was the doctor who took\
care of your son's heart\
10:53\
for so many years."\
10:54\
She crossed the room\
and embraced me.\
10:59\
And for the next\
several minutes there\
11:01\
were hugs and tears\
of joy all around.\
11:05\
After we regained\
our composure, we\
11:08\
moved into the sealing room,\
where Rod and Kim were sealed\
11:11\
for time and all eternity.\
11:14\
Rod, Kim, Betty,\
and I can testify\
11:21\
that heaven was very close,\
that there were others\
11:25\
with us that day who\
had previously passed\
11:29\
through the veil of mortality.\
11:32\
God, in His infinite\
capacity, seals and heals\
11:37\
individuals and families despite\
tragedy, loss, and hardship.\
11:43\
We sometimes\
compare the feelings\
11:45\
we experience in\
temples as having\
11:48\
caught a glimpse of heaven.\
11:50\
That day in the Provo Utah\
Temple, this statement by C. S.\
11:55\
Lewis resonated with me:\
"[Mortals] say of some temporal\
12:00\
suffering, 'No future bliss can\
make up for it,' not knowing\
12:05\
that Heaven, once attained, will\
work backwards and turn even\
12:11\
that agony into a glory. ...\
12:13\
The Blessed will say, 'We have\
never lived anywhere except ...\
12:18\
Heaven.'"\
12:20\
God will strengthen,\
help, and uphold us,\
12:24\
and He will sanctify to\
us our deepest distress.\
12:28\
When we gather our\
family histories\
12:31\
and go to the temple on\
behalf of our ancestors,\
12:34\
God fulfills many of\
these promised blessings\
12:38\
simultaneously on both\
sides of the veil.\
12:41\
Similarly, we are\
blessed when we\
12:44\
help others in our wards\
and stakes do the same.\
12:47\
Members who don't\
live close to a temple\
12:50\
also receive these blessings by\
participating in family history\
12:54\
work, collecting the\
names of their ancestors\
12:57\
for temple ordinances\
to be performed.\
13:01\
President Russell\
M. Nelson, however,\
13:03\
cautioned: "We can be inspired\
all day long about temple\
13:08\
and family history\
experiences others have had.\
13:11\
But we must do\
something to actually\
13:14\
experience the joy ourselves."\
13:17\
He continued, "I invite you to\
prayerfully consider what kind\
13:22\
of sacrifice--preferably a\
sacrifice of time--you can make\
13:27\
[to] do more temple and\
family history work."\
13:30\
As you accept President\
Nelson's invitation,\
13:35\
you will discover, gather,\
and connect your family.\
13:40\
Additionally, blessings will\
flow to you and your family\
13:45\
like the river\
spoken of by Ezekiel.\
13:48\
You will find healing for\
that which needs healing.\
13:53\
Orson and Parley\
Pratt experienced\
13:55\
the healing and sealing effects\
of family history and temple\
13:59\
work early in this dispensation.\
14:01\
Betty, her family, and\
Rod experienced it.\
14:06\
You can too.\
14:08\
Through His atoning\
sacrifice, Jesus Christ\
14:12\
offers these blessings to all,\
both the dead and the living.\
14:17\
Because of these blessings,\
we will find that we,\
14:21\
metaphorically, "have never\
lived anywhere except ...\
14:25\
Heaven."\
14:26\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
