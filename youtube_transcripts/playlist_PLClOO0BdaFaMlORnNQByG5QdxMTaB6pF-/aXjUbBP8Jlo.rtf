What a wonderful\
blessing to live\
0:03\
in a time of continual\
revelation from God!\
0:07\
As we look forward to and\
embrace the "restitution\
0:10\
of all things,"\
which has and will\
0:13\
come through the prophesied\
events of our time,\
0:16\
we are being prepared for\
the Savior's Second Coming.\
0:20\
And what better way\
to prepare to meet Him\
0:22\
than to strive to become\
like Him through lovingly\
0:26\
ministering to one another!\
0:28\
As Jesus Christ\
taught His followers\
0:30\
at the beginning of\
this dispensation,\
0:32\
"If thou lovest me\
thou shalt serve me."\
0:36\
Our service to others is a\
demonstration of discipleship\
0:40\
and our gratitude and love for\
God and His Son, Jesus Christ.\
0:45\
Sometimes we think we\
have to do something grand\
0:47\
and heroic to "count" as\
serving our neighbors.\
0:50\
Yet simple acts of service\
can have profound effects\
0:53\
on others--as well\
as on ourselves.\
0:56\
What did the Savior do?\
0:58\
Through His supernal\
gifts of the Atonement\
1:01\
and Resurrection--which we\
celebrate on this beautiful\
1:04\
Easter Sunday--none other has\
had so profound an influence\
1:08\
on all who have lived and who\
will yet live upon the earth.\
1:12\
But He also smiled at, talked\
with, walked with, listened to,\
1:19\
made time for, encouraged,\
taught, fed, and forgave.\
1:24\
He served family and friends,\
neighbors and strangers alike,\
1:28\
and He invited\
acquaintances and loved ones\
1:31\
to enjoy the rich\
blessings of His gospel.\
1:34\
Those "simple" acts\
of service and love\
1:37\
provide a template for\
our ministering today.\
1:41\
As you have the\
privilege to represent\
1:43\
the Savior in your ministering\
efforts, ask yourself,\
1:46\
"How can I share the\
light of the gospel\
1:48\
with this individual or family?\
1:50\
What is the Spirit\
inspiring me to do?"\
1:54\
Ministering can be\
done in a great variety\
1:57\
of individualized ways.\
1:58\
So what does it look like?\
2:01\
Ministering looks like elders\
quorum and Relief Society\
2:03\
presidencies prayerfully\
counseling about assignments.\
2:06\
Rather than leaders just\
handing out slips of paper,\
2:09\
it looks like counseling about\
the individuals and families\
2:12\
in person as assignments are\
given to ministering brothers\
2:16\
and sisters.\
2:17\
It looks like going for\
a walk, getting together\
2:20\
for a game night, offering\
service, or even serving\
2:23\
together.\
2:24\
It looks like visiting in\
person or talking on the phone\
2:27\
or chatting online or texting.\
2:29\
It looks like delivering\
a birthday card\
2:32\
and cheering at a soccer game.\
2:33\
It looks like sharing\
a scripture or quote\
2:36\
from a conference\
talk that would be\
2:37\
meaningful to that individual.\
2:39\
It looks like discussing\
a gospel question\
2:42\
and sharing testimony to\
bring clarity and peace.\
2:45\
It looks like becoming\
part of someone's life\
2:49\
and caring about him or her.\
2:52\
It also looks like a\
ministering interview\
2:54\
in which needs and\
strengths are discussed\
2:57\
sensitively and appropriately.\
2:59\
It looks like the ward\
council organizing\
3:01\
to respond to a larger need.\
3:04\
This kind of ministering\
strengthened one sister\
3:06\
who moved far away from home\
when her husband started\
3:10\
graduate school.\
3:11\
With no working phone and\
a small baby to care for,\
3:15\
she felt disoriented\
in the new location,\
3:17\
totally lost and alone.\
3:19\
Without advance notice, a Relief\
Society sister came to the door\
3:24\
bringing a little pair\
of shoes for the baby,\
3:26\
put the two of\
them into her car,\
3:28\
and took them to find\
the grocery store.\
3:31\
The grateful sister reported,\
"She was my lifeline!"\
3:36\
True ministering is illustrated\
by an older sister in Africa\
3:39\
who was assigned to\
seek out a sister who\
3:41\
had not attended Church\
meetings for a long time.\
3:44\
When she went to\
the sister's home,\
3:47\
she found that the woman\
had been beaten and robbed,\
3:49\
had very little to eat,\
and possessed no clothes\
3:53\
that she felt were appropriate\
for Sunday Church meetings.\
3:56\
The woman assigned\
to minister to her\
3:58\
brought a listening ear,\
produce from her garden,\
4:02\
scriptures to read,\
and friendship.\
4:05\
The "missing" sister\
soon came back to church\
4:08\
and now holds a\
calling because she\
4:09\
knows she is loved and valued.\
4:13\
Combining such Relief\
Society efforts\
4:15\
with the now-restructured\
elders quorum\
4:17\
will bring a unity that can\
yield astonishing results.\
4:21\
Ministering becomes\
one coordinated effort\
4:24\
to fulfill the\
priesthood duty to "visit\
4:27\
the house of each member" and to\
"watch over the church always,\
4:30\
and be with and\
strengthen them,"\
4:33\
as well as to achieve\
the Relief Society\
4:35\
purpose to help\
one another prepare\
4:37\
for the blessings\
of eternal life.\
4:39\
Working together under the\
direction of the bishop,\
4:42\
elders quorum and Relief\
Society presidencies\
4:45\
can be inspired as\
they seek the best ways\
4:48\
to watch over and care for\
each individual and family.\
4:52\
Let me give you an example.\
4:55\
A mother was\
diagnosed with cancer.\
4:58\
Soon she began treatment, and\
immediately the Relief Society\
5:01\
sisters went to\
work, planning how\
5:03\
to best help with\
meals, transportation\
5:05\
to medical appointments,\
and other support.\
5:08\
They visited her\
regularly, providing\
5:11\
cheerful companionship.\
5:12\
At the same time, the\
Melchizedek Priesthood quorum\
5:16\
sprang into action.\
5:17\
They provided labor in adding a\
remodeled bedroom and bathroom\
5:21\
to make it easier to\
care for the sick sister.\
5:24\
The young men lent\
their hands and backs\
5:26\
to participate in that\
significant effort.\
5:29\
And the young\
women got involved:\
5:31\
they cheerfully arranged\
to faithfully walk\
5:34\
the dog each day.\
5:35\
As time passed, the ward\
continued their service,\
5:39\
adding and adapting\
where necessary.\
5:42\
It was clearly a labor of\
love, each member giving\
5:46\
of him or herself,\
unitedly showing\
5:49\
caring in individual\
ways that blessed\
5:52\
not only the suffering sister\
but each member of her family.\
5:57\
After a valiant\
effort, the sister\
5:59\
finally succumbed to the\
cancer and was laid to rest.\
6:03\
Did the ward breathe\
a sigh of relief\
6:05\
and consider the job\
well done and well over?\
6:08\
No, the young women continue\
to walk the dog daily,\
6:12\
the priesthood quorums\
continue to minister\
6:15\
to the father and his family,\
and the Relief Society sisters\
6:18\
continue to reach out in love to\
ascertain strengths and needs.\
6:23\
Brothers and sisters, this is\
ministering--this is loving\
6:27\
as the Savior does!\
6:30\
Another blessing\
of these inspired\
6:32\
announcements is the opportunity\
for young women ages 14 to 18\
6:36\
to participate in ministering\
as companions to Relief Society\
6:39\
sisters, just as young\
men their age serve\
6:42\
as ministering companions\
to Melchizedek Priesthood\
6:44\
brethren.\
6:45\
Youth can share\
their unique gifts\
6:47\
and grow spiritually as\
they serve alongside adults\
6:51\
in the work of salvation.\
6:52\
Involving youth in\
ministering assignments\
6:55\
can also increase the\
reach of Relief Society\
6:57\
and elders quorums'\
caring for others\
6:59\
by increasing the number\
of members who participate.\
7:03\
As I think about the stellar\
young women I have known,\
7:06\
I get excited for\
those Relief Society\
7:09\
sisters who will have the\
privilege of being blessed\
7:12\
by a young woman's\
enthusiasm, talents,\
7:14\
and spiritual sensitivity\
as they serve side by side\
7:18\
or are ministered to by them.\
7:20\
And I am equally delighted by\
the chance young women will\
7:23\
have to be mentored and\
taught and strengthened\
7:26\
by their sisters\
in Relief Society.\
7:28\
This opportunity to participate\
in building the kingdom of God\
7:32\
will be a tremendous\
benefit to young women,\
7:35\
helping them better prepare to\
fulfill their roles as leaders\
7:39\
in the Church and the community\
and as contributing partners\
7:42\
in their families.\
7:44\
As Sister Bonnie L. Oscarson\
shared yesterday, young women\
7:48\
"want to be of service.\
7:49\
They need to know they\
are valued and essential\
7:52\
in the work of salvation."\
7:54\
In fact, young women are\
already ministering to others,\
7:57\
without assignment or fanfare.\
7:59\
A family I know moved\
hundreds of miles\
8:02\
to a new location\
where they knew no one.\
8:05\
Within the first week,\
a 14-year-old girl\
8:08\
from their new ward showed\
up on their doorstep\
8:10\
with a plate of cookies,\
welcoming them to the area.\
8:14\
Her mother stood smiling behind\
her as a willing chauffeur,\
8:18\
supporting her daughter's\
desire to minister.\
8:21\
Another mother was\
concerned one day\
8:23\
that her 16-year-old daughter\
was not home at the usual hour.\
8:27\
When the girl finally\
arrived, her mother\
8:29\
quizzed her with\
some frustration\
8:31\
about where she had been.\
8:33\
The 16-year-old\
almost sheepishly\
8:35\
replied that she\
had taken a flower\
8:38\
to a widow who lived nearby.\
8:40\
She had noticed the older\
sister looking lonely\
8:43\
and felt prompted to visit her.\
8:44\
With her mother's\
complete approval,\
8:47\
the young woman continued\
to visit the elderly woman.\
8:50\
They became good friends,\
and their sweet association\
8:53\
continued for years.\
8:56\
Each of these young women,\
and many more like them,\
8:59\
noticed someone's need\
and worked to meet it.\
9:02\
Young women have a natural\
desire to care and share\
9:06\
that can be well directed\
through ministering\
9:08\
in partnership with\
an adult sister.\
9:12\
No matter our age,\
when we consider\
9:14\
how to minister\
most effectively,\
9:16\
we ask, "What does\
she [or he] need?"\
9:20\
Coupling that question with\
a sincere desire to serve,\
9:24\
we are then led by\
the Spirit to do\
9:27\
what would lift and\
strengthen the individual.\
9:30\
I have heard countless stories\
of brothers and sisters\
9:33\
who were blessed by a\
simple gesture of inclusion\
9:36\
and welcome at church, a\
thoughtful email or text\
9:39\
message, a personal contact\
at a difficult time,\
9:43\
an invitation to participate\
in a group activity,\
9:46\
or an offer to help with\
a challenging situation.\
9:49\
Single parents, new converts,\
less-active members, widows\
9:54\
and widowers, or\
struggling youth\
9:56\
may need extra\
attention and priority\
9:59\
help from ministering\
brothers and sisters.\
10:02\
Coordination between elders\
quorum and Relief Society\
10:05\
presidencies allows for just the\
right assignments to be made.\
10:10\
After all is said and\
done, true ministering\
10:13\
is accomplished one by one\
with love as the motivation.\
10:17\
The value and merit and\
wonder of sincere ministering\
10:22\
is that it truly changes lives!\
10:25\
When our hearts are open and\
willing to love and include,\
10:29\
encourage and comfort, the\
power of our ministering\
10:33\
will be irresistible.\
10:35\
With love as the motivation,\
miracles will happen\
10:39\
and we will find ways to\
bring our "missing" sisters\
10:42\
and brothers into the\
all-inclusive embrace\
10:45\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
10:48\
The Savior is our example in\
everything--not only in what we\
10:52\
should do but why\
we should do it.\
10:55\
"His life on earth was [an]\
invitation to us--to raise\
10:58\
our sights a little higher,\
to forget our own problems\
11:01\
and [to] reach out to others."\
11:04\
As we accept the opportunity\
to wholeheartedly minister\
11:08\
to our sisters and\
brothers, we are\
11:10\
blessed to become more\
spiritually refined, more\
11:13\
in tune with the will\
of God, and more able\
11:16\
to understand His plan to\
help each one return to Him.\
11:20\
We will more readily\
recognize His blessings\
11:23\
and be eager to extend\
those blessings to others.\
11:27\
Our hearts will sing in\
unison with our voices:\
11:30\
"Savior, may I love my brother\
11:33\
As I know thou lovest me,\
11:36\
Find in thee my\
strength, my beacon,\
11:39\
For thy servant I would be.\
11:42\
Savior, may I love my brother--\
11:45\
Lord, I would follow thee."\
11:49\
May we show our gratitude\
and love for God\
11:52\
by ministering with love to our\
eternal sisters and brothers.\
11:56\
The result will be\
a unity of feeling\
11:58\
such as the people\
in ancient America\
12:00\
enjoyed one hundred years\
after the Savior's appearance\
12:03\
in their land.\
12:03\
"And it came to pass that\
there was no contention ...\
12:08\
because of the love of God\
which did dwell in the hearts\
12:10\
of the people.\
12:11\
"...\
12:11\
There were no envyings,\
nor strifes, ...\
12:14\
and surely there could not\
be a happier people among all\
12:17\
the people who had been\
created by the hand of God."\
12:22\
I gladly bear my\
personal witness\
12:24\
that these revelatory\
changes are inspired of God\
12:27\
and that as we embrace\
them with willing hearts,\
12:30\
we will become better prepared\
to meet His Son, Jesus Christ,\
12:34\
at His coming.\
12:36\
We will be closer to\
becoming a Zion people\
12:39\
and will feel surpassing joy\
with those whom we have helped\
12:42\
along the path of discipleship.\
12:45\
That we do so is my\
fervent and humble prayer\
12:49\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
