My beloved brethren, I am\
grateful for the privilege\
0:05\
of speaking to you in this\
historic general conference.\
0:10\
We have sustained\
President Russell M. Nelson\
0:14\
as the 17th President\
of The Church of Jesus\
0:18\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
0:20\
As I have had the blessing\
of working with him each day,\
0:24\
I have felt a\
confirmation of the Spirit\
0:28\
that President Nelson\
is called of God\
0:31\
to lead the Lord's true Church.\
0:33\
It is also my\
witness that the Lord\
0:38\
has called Elder Gong\
and Elder Soares to serve\
0:42\
as members of the Quorum\
of the Twelve Apostles.\
0:46\
I love and sustain them.\
0:49\
They will, by their ministry,\
bless lives across the world\
0:54\
and across generations.\
0:57\
This conference is historic\
for yet another reason.\
1:01\
President Nelson has announced\
an inspired step forward\
1:06\
in the Lord's organized\
plan for His Church.\
1:10\
That plan includes\
a new structure\
1:12\
for priesthood quorums\
in wards and stakes\
1:15\
so that we may better\
fulfill our priesthood\
1:18\
responsibilities.\
1:21\
Those responsibilities all have\
to do with our priesthood care\
1:27\
of our Father's children.\
1:29\
The Lord's plan for His\
Saints to provide loving care\
1:34\
has taken many forms\
over the years.\
1:38\
In the early days of Nauvoo,\
the Prophet Joseph Smith\
1:41\
needed an organized way\
to care for the flood\
1:44\
of largely impoverished\
converts coming into the city.\
1:49\
Four of my great-grandparents\
were among them--the Eyrings,\
1:53\
Bennions, Romneys, and Smiths.\
1:56\
The Prophet organized the care\
of those Saints by geography.\
2:01\
In Illinois, those divisions of\
the city were called "wards."\
2:06\
As the Saints moved\
across the plains,\
2:09\
their care for each other\
was organized in "companies."\
2:13\
One of my paternal\
great-grandfathers\
2:16\
was returning from his mission\
in what is now Oklahoma when\
2:21\
he met a company on the trail.\
2:24\
He was so weak with disease\
that he and his companion\
2:28\
were on their backs\
in a little wagon.\
2:32\
The leader of the company\
sent two young women\
2:35\
to help whoever might be\
in that forlorn wagon.\
2:39\
One of them, a young sister\
who had been converted\
2:43\
in Switzerland, took a look\
at one of the missionaries\
2:46\
and felt compassion.\
2:48\
He was saved by that\
company of Saints.\
2:51\
He recovered enough to\
walk the rest of the way\
2:55\
to the Salt Lake Valley with\
the young rescuer by his side.\
3:00\
They fell in love and married.\
3:03\
He became my great-grandfather\
Henry Eyring,\
3:06\
and she my great-grandmother\
Maria Bommeli Eyring.\
3:11\
Years later, when\
people remarked\
3:13\
at the great difficulty of\
moving across a continent,\
3:17\
she said, "Oh no,\
it wasn't hard.\
3:20\
While we walked, we talked the\
whole way about what a miracle\
3:23\
it was that we had both found\
the true gospel of Jesus\
3:28\
Christ.\
3:28\
It was the happiest\
time I can remember."\
3:32\
Since then, the Lord has\
used a variety of ways\
3:35\
to help His Saints\
care for each other.\
3:39\
Now He has blessed us with\
strengthened and unified\
3:43\
quorums at the ward and stake\
levels--quorums that work\
3:48\
in coordination with\
all ward organizations.\
3:53\
Municipal wards, companies,\
and strengthened quorums\
3:56\
have all required\
at least two things\
4:00\
to be successful in\
the Lord's intent\
4:03\
to have His Saints care for\
each other in the way He\
4:07\
cares for them.\
4:08\
They succeed when the Saints\
feel the love of Christ\
4:13\
for each other above\
their self-interest.\
4:16\
The scriptures call it "charity\
... the pure love of Christ."\
4:21\
And they succeed when the Holy\
Ghost guides the caregiver\
4:26\
to know what the Lord knows\
is best for the person\
4:29\
that he is trying to help.\
4:32\
Time after time in recent\
weeks, members of the Church\
4:36\
have acted in my presence\
as if they somehow\
4:40\
had anticipated what\
the Lord was going to do\
4:44\
and has been\
announced here today.\
4:46\
Let me give you\
just two examples.\
4:49\
One, a simple sacrament meeting\
talk by a 14-year-old teacher\
4:54\
in the Aaronic Priesthood\
who understands\
4:57\
what priesthood\
holders can accomplish\
4:59\
in their service for the Lord.\
5:02\
Then the second story, a\
Melchizedek Priesthood holder\
5:05\
who, with the love of Christ,\
was inspired to serve a family.\
5:12\
First, let me give you the\
words of the young man speaking\
5:15\
to a ward sacrament meeting.\
5:17\
I was there.\
5:18\
Try to remember what\
you were like when\
5:21\
you were 14 years\
old, and listen\
5:25\
to hear him say more than so\
young a man could reasonably\
5:30\
know:\
5:31\
"I have really liked being\
a member of the teachers\
5:33\
quorum in our ward since\
I turned 14 last year.\
5:37\
A teacher still has all\
the responsibilities\
5:40\
of a deacon plus some new ones.\
5:43\
"Since some of us are teachers,\
others will be someday,\
5:46\
and everyone in the Church\
is blessed by the priesthood,\
5:50\
so it's important [to]\
all of us to know more\
5:52\
about the duties of a teacher.\
5:55\
"First of all, Doctrine\
and Covenants 20:53 says,\
5:59\
'The teacher's duty is to\
watch over the church always,\
6:04\
and be with and\
strengthen them.'\
6:07\
"Next, Doctrine and Covenants\
20:54-55"--this 14-year-old\
6:13\
quoted these scriptures.\
6:14\
I don't think he\
even had a note,\
6:16\
if I've got it right--"'And\
see that there is no iniquity\
6:20\
in the church, neither hardness\
with each other, neither lying,\
6:23\
backbiting, nor evil speaking;\
6:26\
"'And see that the church\
meet together often,\
6:29\
and also see that all the\
members do their duty.'"\
6:33\
THE YOUNG MAN CONTINUED:\
"The Lord is telling us\
6:37\
it's our responsibility to\
not only care for the Church\
6:41\
but to also care for the people\
within the Church the way\
6:44\
that Christ would because\
this is His Church.\
6:48\
If we are trying to\
keep the commandments,\
6:51\
be kind to each other, be\
honest, be good friends,\
6:54\
and enjoy being\
together, then we\
6:57\
will be able to have\
the Spirit with us\
7:00\
and know what Heavenly\
Father wants us to do.\
7:03\
If we don't, then we can't\
fulfill our calling."\
7:08\
HE WENT ON TO SAY:\
"When a teacher chooses\
7:10\
to set the right example by\
being a good home teacher,\
7:14\
greeting the members at Church,\
preparing the sacrament,\
7:18\
helping at home, and\
being a peacemaker,\
7:21\
he's choosing to\
honor his priesthood\
7:23\
and fulfill his calling.\
7:26\
"Being a good\
teacher doesn't only\
7:28\
mean being responsible when\
we are at church or at Church\
7:31\
activities.\
7:32\
The Apostle Paul taught,\
'Be thou an example\
7:35\
of the believers, in word,\
in conversation, in charity,\
7:39\
in spirit, in\
faith, in purity.'"\
7:41\
Then the young man said,\
"No matter where we are\
7:44\
or what we are doing, we can be\
a good example of righteousness\
7:48\
at all times and in all places."\
7:51\
HE SAID: "My dad and I\
home teach the Browns.\
7:55\
Every time we go over there,\
I have a great time visiting\
7:58\
and getting to know them.\
7:59\
One thing I really like about\
the Browns is whenever we go\
8:03\
over there, they are ... willing\
to listen and they always have\
8:06\
good stories to share.\
8:09\
"When we know people in the ward\
well because of home teaching,\
8:12\
it makes it easier to do\
the next duty of a teacher,\
8:15\
and that's greeting\
the members at church.\
8:18\
Helping people feel welcome\
and included at church\
8:21\
helps all the members of the\
ward feel loved and prepared\
8:25\
to take the sacrament.\
8:27\
"After greeting members\
who have come to church,\
8:29\
teachers help each Sunday\
by preparing the sacrament.\
8:32\
I really enjoy\
passing and preparing\
8:35\
the sacrament in this\
ward because everyone\
8:37\
is so reverent.\
8:39\
I always feel the Spirit when I\
prepare and pass the sacrament.\
8:43\
It's a real blessing to me that\
I'm able to do it every Sunday.\
8:48\
"Some service like passing the\
sacrament is something people\
8:51\
see and they thank\
us for doing it,\
8:54\
but other service like\
preparing the sacrament\
8:57\
is usually done without\
anyone noticing.\
9:00\
It isn't important if people\
see us serving; what's important\
9:05\
is that the Lord knows\
we have served Him.\
9:09\
"As teachers, we\
should always try\
9:11\
to strengthen the Church,\
our friends, and our family\
9:14\
by fulfilling our\
priesthood responsibilities.\
9:17\
It's not always easy, but the\
Lord gives no commandments\
9:21\
to us 'save he shall prepare\
a way for [us to] accomplish\
9:25\
the thing which he commandeth.'"\
9:27\
As that young man\
concluded, I continued\
9:30\
to be amazed and\
touched, as you can tell,\
9:33\
at his maturity and wisdom.\
9:36\
He summarized by\
saying, "I know we\
9:39\
will become better if we choose\
to follow [Jesus Christ]."\
9:45\
Another story of\
priesthood service\
9:48\
was told a month ago in\
a ward sacrament meeting.\
9:51\
Again, I was there.\
9:53\
In this case, the seasoned\
Melchizedek Priesthood holder\
9:57\
didn't know as he spoke\
that he was describing\
10:00\
exactly what the Lord\
desires to happen\
10:03\
with strengthened\
priesthood quorums.\
10:06\
Here is the gist of his account.\
10:08\
It's not in his words.\
10:10\
He and a home teaching\
companion were assigned\
10:14\
to serve seven families.\
10:16\
Almost all of them\
did not want visits.\
10:19\
This may sound familiar\
to some of you.\
10:22\
When the home teachers\
went to their apartments,\
10:25\
they refused to answer the door.\
10:27\
When they telephoned, they\
did not get an answer.\
10:30\
When they left a message,\
the call was not returned.\
10:33\
The senior companion\
finally resorted\
10:36\
to a letter-writing ministry.\
10:39\
He even began to use\
bright yellow envelopes\
10:42\
in the hope of getting\
notice and a response.\
10:46\
One of the seven families was\
a less-active single sister\
10:50\
who had emigrated from Europe.\
10:52\
She had two young children.\
10:55\
After many attempts\
to contact her,\
10:57\
he received a text message.\
10:59\
She abruptly\
informed him that she\
11:01\
was too busy to meet\
with home teachers.\
11:04\
She had two jobs and was\
in the military as well.\
11:08\
Her primary job was that\
of a police officer,\
11:11\
and her career goal was\
to become a detective\
11:15\
and then return to\
her native country\
11:17\
and continue her work there.\
11:20\
The home teacher never was able\
to visit with her in her home.\
11:24\
He periodically texted her.\
11:27\
Every month he sent\
a handwritten letter,\
11:29\
supplemented with holiday\
cards for each child.\
11:33\
He received no response.\
11:35\
But she knew who her\
home teachers were,\
11:38\
how to contact them, and\
that they would persist\
11:41\
in their priesthood service.\
11:43\
Then one day he received\
an urgent text from her.\
11:47\
She desperately needed help.\
11:49\
She did not know\
who the bishop was,\
11:52\
but she did know\
her home teachers.\
11:54\
In a few days, she\
said, she had to leave\
11:57\
the state for a monthlong\
military training exercise.\
12:01\
She could not take\
her children with her.\
12:03\
Her mother, who was going\
to care for her children,\
12:06\
had just flown to Europe to\
care for her husband, who\
12:09\
had a medical emergency.\
12:12\
This less-active single\
sister had enough money\
12:15\
to buy a ticket to Europe\
for her youngest child\
12:18\
but not for her\
12-year-old son, Eric.\
12:22\
She asked her home\
teacher if he could\
12:25\
find a good LDS family to\
take Eric in their home\
12:28\
for the next 30 days!\
12:32\
The home teacher texted back\
that he would do his best.\
12:36\
He then contacted his\
priesthood leaders.\
12:39\
The bishop, who is the\
presiding high priest,\
12:43\
gave him approval to approach\
members of the ward council,\
12:48\
including the Relief\
Society president.\
12:51\
The Relief Society\
president quickly\
12:54\
found four good\
families, with children\
12:56\
about Eric's age, who would\
take him into their homes\
13:00\
for a week at a time.\
13:01\
Over the next month,\
these families\
13:03\
fed Eric, found room for\
him in their already crowded\
13:07\
apartments or small\
homes, took him\
13:09\
on their previously\
planned summer\
13:11\
family activities,\
brought him to church,\
13:14\
included him in their family\
home evenings, and on and on.\
13:19\
The families with\
boys Eric's age\
13:21\
included him in their deacons\
quorum meetings and activities.\
13:25\
During this 30-day period,\
Eric was in church every Sunday\
13:30\
for the first time in his life.\
13:33\
After his mother came\
home from her training,\
13:35\
Eric continued to\
attend church, usually\
13:38\
with one of these four\
volunteer LDS families or others\
13:42\
who had befriended him,\
including his mother's visiting\
13:45\
teachers.\
13:46\
In time, he was\
ordained a deacon\
13:49\
and began passing the\
sacrament regularly.\
13:52\
Now, let us look\
into Eric's future.\
13:54\
We will not be surprised if he\
becomes a leader in the Church\
13:58\
in his mother's home country\
when his family returns\
14:02\
there--all because of Saints\
who worked together in unity,\
14:07\
under the direction of a\
bishop, to serve out of charity\
14:12\
in their hearts and with\
the power of the Holy Ghost.\
14:16\
We know that charity\
is essential for us\
14:18\
to be saved in the\
kingdom of God.\
14:20\
Moroni wrote, "Except\
ye have charity ye\
14:23\
can in nowise be saved\
in the kingdom of God."\
14:27\
We also know that charity\
is a gift bestowed\
14:29\
upon us after all we can do.\
14:32\
We must "pray unto the Father\
with all the energy of heart,\
14:35\
that [we] may be filled\
with this love, which\
14:37\
he hath bestowed\
upon all who are\
14:40\
true followers of his\
Son, Jesus Christ."\
14:43\
It seems to me that we\
receive the Holy Spirit best\
14:47\
when we are focused\
on serving others.\
14:50\
That is why we have the\
priesthood responsibility\
14:54\
to serve for the Savior.\
14:56\
When we are engaged\
in service to others,\
15:00\
we think less about\
ourselves, and the Holy Ghost\
15:03\
can more readily come\
to us and help us\
15:07\
in our lifelong quest to have\
the gift of charity bestowed\
15:12\
upon us.\
15:14\
I bear you my testimony\
that the Lord has already\
15:16\
begun a great step\
forward in His plan for us\
15:20\
to become even more\
inspired and charitable\
15:24\
in our priesthood\
ministering service.\
15:27\
I am grateful for His love,\
which He so generously gives\
15:31\
us.\
15:32\
I so testify and express\
this appreciation\
15:37\
in the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
