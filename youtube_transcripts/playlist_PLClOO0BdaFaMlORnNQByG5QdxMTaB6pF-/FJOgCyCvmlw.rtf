On this Easter\
Sunday, our thoughts\
0:04\
turn to the Resurrection\
of the Lord Jesus Christ\
0:07\
and to the empty tomb that\
gives every believer hope\
0:11\
in Christ's triumph over\
otherwise certain defeat.\
0:15\
I believe, with\
the Apostle Paul,\
0:18\
that just as God "raised up\
Christ from the dead [so]\
0:24\
shall [He] also quicken [our]\
mortal bodies by his Spirit\
0:27\
that dwelleth in [us]."\
0:30\
To quicken means to make alive.\
0:32\
Just as Christ brings\
our bodies back to life\
0:35\
after physical death through\
the power of His Resurrection,\
0:40\
so can He also quicken\
us, or make us alive,\
0:44\
from spiritual death.\
0:46\
In the book of Moses, we read\
of Adam undergoing this kind\
0:51\
of quickening:\
"[Adam] was baptized,\
0:55\
and the Spirit of God\
descended upon him,\
0:58\
and thus he was\
born of the Spirit,\
1:01\
and became quickened\
in the inner man."\
1:06\
What an incomparable gift\
comes to those who put\
1:10\
their faith in Jesus Christ.\
1:12\
That gift is the\
Holy Spirit giving us\
1:16\
what the New Testament\
calls "life in Christ."\
1:20\
But do we sometimes take\
for granted such a gift?\
1:26\
Brothers and sisters, it is\
an extraordinary privilege\
1:30\
to "have ... the Holy Spirit for\
[our] guide"--as demonstrated\
1:34\
by the following experience.\
1:37\
During the Korean War,\
Ensign Frank Blair\
1:40\
served on a troop transport\
ship stationed in Japan.\
1:45\
The ship wasn't large enough\
to have a formal chaplain,\
1:49\
so the captain asked Brother\
Blair to be the ship's\
1:52\
informal chaplain, having\
observed that the young man was\
1:56\
a person of faith and\
principle, highly respected\
2:00\
by the whole crew.\
2:03\
ENSIGN BLAIR WROTE: "Our ship\
was caught in a huge typhoon.\
2:07\
The waves were\
about 45 feet high.\
2:10\
I was on watch ... during which\
time one of our three engines\
2:15\
stopped working and a crack in\
the centerline of the ship was\
2:20\
reported.\
2:21\
We had two remaining\
engines, one of which\
2:25\
was only functioning\
at half power.\
2:28\
We were in serious trouble."\
2:33\
Ensign Blair finished his\
watch and was getting into bed\
2:36\
when the captain\
knocked on his door.\
2:38\
He asked, "Would you\
please pray for this ship?"\
2:42\
Of course, Ensign\
Blair agreed to do so.\
2:47\
At that point, Ensign\
Blair could have simply\
2:50\
prayed, "Heavenly Father,\
please bless our ship\
2:54\
and keep us safe,"\
and then gone to bed.\
2:57\
Instead, he prayed\
to know if there\
3:01\
was something he\
could do to help\
3:04\
ensure the safety of the ship.\
3:06\
In response to Brother\
Blair's prayer,\
3:10\
the Holy Ghost prompted\
him to go to the bridge,\
3:13\
speak with the captain,\
and learn more.\
3:16\
He found that the\
captain was trying\
3:19\
to determine how fast to run\
the ship's remaining engines.\
3:24\
Ensign Blair returned to\
his cabin to pray again.\
3:29\
He prayed, "What can\
I do to help address\
3:33\
the problem with the engines?"\
3:36\
In response, the\
Holy Ghost whispered\
3:38\
that he needed to\
walk around the ship\
3:41\
and observe to gather\
more information.\
3:44\
He again returned to the\
captain and asked for permission\
3:47\
to walk around the deck.\
3:49\
Then, with a lifeline\
tied around his waist,\
3:52\
he went out into the storm.\
3:55\
Standing on the\
stern, he observed\
3:57\
the giant propellers as\
they came out of the water\
4:00\
when the ship crested a wave.\
4:02\
Only one was working fully,\
and it was spinning very fast.\
4:07\
After these observations,\
Ensign Blair once again prayed.\
4:12\
The clear answer he received was\
that the remaining good engine\
4:16\
was under too much strain\
and needed to be slowed down.\
4:20\
So he returned to the captain\
and made that recommendation.\
4:24\
The captain was surprised,\
telling him that\
4:27\
the ship's engineer had just\
suggested the opposite--that\
4:30\
they increase the speed of the\
good engine in order to outrun\
4:33\
the storm.\
4:34\
Nevertheless, the captain\
chose to follow Ensign Blair's\
4:39\
suggestion and slowed\
the engine down.\
4:42\
By dawn, the ship was\
safely in calm waters.\
4:48\
Only two hours later,\
the good engine\
4:50\
stopped working altogether.\
4:52\
With half power in\
the remaining engine,\
4:55\
the ship was able\
to limp into port.\
4:59\
The captain said\
to Ensign Blair,\
5:01\
"If we had not slowed\
that engine when we did,\
5:04\
we would have lost it in\
the middle of the storm."\
5:07\
Without that engine, there\
would have been no way to steer.\
5:10\
The ship would have\
overturned and been sunk.\
5:13\
The captain thanked\
the young LDS officer\
5:16\
and said he believed that\
following Ensign Blair's\
5:19\
spiritual impressions had\
saved the crew and the ship.\
5:24\
Now, this story\
is quite dramatic.\
5:27\
While we may be unlikely to\
face such dire circumstances,\
5:31\
this story contains\
important guidelines\
5:33\
about how we can receive\
the Spirit's guidance more\
5:37\
frequently.\
5:39\
First, when it\
comes to revelation,\
5:41\
we must properly tune our\
receiver to heaven's frequency.\
5:46\
Ensign Blair was living a\
clean and faithful life.\
5:49\
Had he not been\
obedient, he would not\
5:53\
have had the\
spiritual confidence\
5:55\
necessary to pray as he did\
for the safety of his ship\
5:58\
and to receive such\
specific guidance.\
6:01\
We must each be\
making the effort\
6:03\
to align our lives\
with God's commandments\
6:06\
in order to be directed by Him.\
6:09\
Sometimes we can't\
hear heaven's signal\
6:11\
because we are not worthy.\
6:13\
Repentance and\
obedience are the way\
6:15\
to achieve clear\
communication again.\
6:18\
The Old Testament word\
for repent means "to turn"\
6:21\
or "turn around."\
6:23\
When you feel far from\
God, you need only\
6:25\
make the decision\
to turn from sin\
6:27\
and face the Savior, where you\
will find Him waiting for you,\
6:31\
His arms outstretched.\
6:33\
He is eager to guide you, and\
you are just one prayer away\
6:37\
from receiving that\
guidance again.\
6:40\
Second, Ensign\
Blair did not just\
6:42\
ask the Lord to\
solve his problem.\
6:45\
He asked what he could do\
to be part of the solution.\
6:48\
Likewise we might\
ask, "Lord, what do I\
6:53\
need to do to be part\
of the solution?"\
6:56\
Instead of just listing\
our problems in prayer\
6:58\
and asking the\
Lord to solve them,\
7:00\
we ought to be\
seeking more proactive\
7:02\
ways of receiving\
the Lord's help\
7:04\
and committing to act according\
to the Spirit's guidance.\
7:09\
There is a third important\
lesson in Ensign Blair's story.\
7:12\
Could he have prayed\
with such calm assurance\
7:15\
if he had not received\
guidance from the Spirit\
7:18\
on previous occasions?\
7:20\
The arrival of a\
typhoon is no time\
7:24\
to dust off the gift\
of the Holy Ghost\
7:27\
and figure out how to use it.\
7:29\
This young man was clearly\
following a pattern\
7:32\
he had used many times\
before, including\
7:35\
as a full-time missionary.\
7:36\
We need the Holy Spirit as\
our guide in calm waters\
7:41\
so His voice will be\
unmistakable to us\
7:43\
in the fiercest storm.\
7:46\
Some may think we shouldn't\
expect daily guidance\
7:48\
from the Spirit\
because "it is not\
7:50\
meet that [God] should\
command in all things,"\
7:52\
lest we become\
slothful servants.\
7:54\
This scripture,\
however, was given\
7:56\
to some early\
missionaries who asked\
7:58\
Joseph Smith to obtain\
revelation they should\
8:01\
have received for themselves.\
8:03\
In a preceding\
verse, the Lord told\
8:05\
them to come to\
the mission field\
8:07\
"as they shall counsel\
between themselves and me."\
8:11\
These missionaries wanted\
a specific revelation\
8:13\
about their travel plans.\
8:15\
They hadn't yet learned to\
seek their own direction\
8:17\
in personal matters.\
8:19\
The Lord called this\
attitude what it is: sloth.\
8:23\
Early Church members\
may have been\
8:25\
so happy to have a\
true prophet that they\
8:28\
were in danger of failing to\
learn how to receive revelation\
8:31\
themselves.\
8:32\
Being spiritually\
self-reliant is\
8:36\
to be able to hear the Lord's\
voice through His Spirit\
8:40\
for one's own life.\
8:43\
Alma advised his son to\
"counsel with the Lord\
8:47\
in all thy doings."\
8:49\
To live in this way--what\
we often call "living\
8:52\
by the Spirit"--is\
a high privilege.\
8:54\
It brings a sense of\
calm and certainty\
8:58\
as well as fruits of the Spirit\
such as love, joy, and peace.\
9:03\
Ensign Blair's ability\
to receive revelation\
9:06\
saved him and his shipmates\
from a raging storm.\
9:10\
Other kinds of storms\
are raging today.\
9:14\
The Book of Mormon's\
parable of the tree of life\
9:17\
provides a powerful image of\
how to achieve spiritual safety\
9:21\
in such a world.\
9:22\
This dream tells of sudden\
mists of darkness arising\
9:26\
to bring spiritual destruction\
to members of the Church\
9:28\
walking on the path back to God.\
9:32\
In contemplating this image,\
I see in my mind's eye throngs\
9:36\
of people traveling that\
path, some with their hands\
9:39\
firmly gripping the iron\
rod, but many others simply\
9:44\
following the feet of the\
people in front of them.\
9:47\
This latter approach takes\
little thought or effort.\
9:50\
You can just do and think what\
others are doing and thinking.\
9:53\
This works fine\
in sunny weather.\
9:56\
But the storms of deception\
and the mists of falsehood\
10:00\
arise without warning.\
10:02\
In these situations,\
being familiar\
10:05\
with the voice of the\
Holy Ghost is a matter\
10:09\
of spiritual life and death.\
10:13\
Nephi's powerful promise is\
that "whoso would hearken unto\
10:18\
the word of God, and ...\
hold fast unto it ...\
10:22\
would never perish; neither\
could the temptations\
10:25\
and the fiery darts of the\
adversary overpower them unto\
10:28\
blindness, to lead them\
away to destruction."\
10:32\
Following the feet of the\
people ahead of you on the path\
10:34\
is not enough.\
10:36\
We cannot just do and think what\
others are doing and thinking;\
10:40\
we must live a guided life.\
10:43\
We must each have our\
own hand on the iron rod.\
10:46\
Then we may go to\
the Lord with humble\
10:49\
confidence, knowing that He\
"shall lead [us] by the hand,\
10:54\
and give [us] answer\
to [our] prayers."\
10:56\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
