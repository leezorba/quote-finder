Thank you, Elder Gong\
and Elder Soares,\
0:03\
for your heartfelt\
expressions of faith.\
0:06\
We are so very grateful for\
you and your dear companions.\
0:12\
Now, dear brothers and\
sisters, we constantly\
0:14\
seek direction from\
the Lord on how\
0:16\
we can help our members keep the\
commandments of God, especially\
0:20\
those two great commandments\
to love God and our neighbors.\
0:26\
For months we have been seeking\
a better way to minister\
0:29\
to the spiritual and\
temporal needs of our people\
0:32\
in the Savior's way.\
0:35\
We have made the\
decision to retire\
0:39\
home teaching and visiting\
teaching as we have known them.\
0:45\
Instead, we will implement\
a newer, holier approach\
0:51\
to caring and\
ministering to others.\
0:53\
We will refer to these efforts\
simply as "ministering."\
1:00\
Effective ministering\
efforts are\
1:02\
enabled by the innate\
gifts of the sisters\
1:05\
and by the incomparable\
power of the priesthood.\
1:10\
We all need such protection\
from the cunning wiles\
1:15\
of the adversary.\
1:18\
Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the\
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles\
1:21\
and Sister Jean B. Bingham,\
General President of the Relief\
1:26\
Society, will explain\
how assigned brethren\
1:30\
of the priesthood and assigned\
sisters of the Relief Society\
1:36\
and Young Women\
will now function\
1:39\
in serving and\
watching over members\
1:42\
of the Church\
throughout the world.\
1:46\
The First Presidency\
and the Twelve\
1:47\
are united in endorsing\
their messages.\
1:52\
Gratefully and prayerfully\
we open this new chapter\
1:57\
in the history of the Church.\
1:59\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
