Dear brothers and sisters,\
I appreciate very much\
0:06\
the opportunity to express\
to you some of my feelings.\
0:11\
Several years ago,\
my wife and I were\
0:15\
present at the\
inaugural ceremony\
0:17\
of the interactive\
children's exhibit\
0:19\
in the Church History\
Museum in Salt Lake City.\
0:24\
At the end of the ceremony,\
President Thomas S.\
0:27\
Monson walked toward us, and\
as he shook our hands he said,\
0:33\
"Endure, and you shall\
triumph"--a profound teaching\
0:40\
and one which truth, of\
course, we can all affirm.\
0:45\
Jesus Christ assured us that "he\
that shall endure unto the end,\
0:50\
the same shall be saved."\
0:54\
To endure means "to remain\
firm in a commitment\
0:58\
to be true to the\
commandments of God\
1:01\
despite temptation,\
opposition, or adversity."\
1:06\
Even those who have had\
powerful spiritual experiences\
1:11\
and have given faithful\
service could one day\
1:15\
go astray or fall into\
inactivity if they do not\
1:22\
endure to the end.\
1:24\
May we always and\
emphatically keep\
1:28\
in our minds and\
hearts the phrase\
1:31\
"This will not happen to me."\
1:35\
When Jesus Christ\
taught in Capernaum,\
1:38\
"many of his\
disciples went back,\
1:41\
and walked no more with him.\
1:44\
"Then Jesus said unto the\
twelve, Will ye also go away?"\
1:49\
I believe that\
today, Jesus Christ\
1:53\
asks all of us who have made\
sacred covenants with Him,\
1:58\
"Will ye also go away?"\
2:01\
I pray that all of us, with\
profound reflection about what\
2:06\
the eternities hold\
for us, may respond\
2:10\
as did Simon Peter: "Lord,\
to whom shall we go?\
2:15\
thou hast the words\
of eternal life."\
2:20\
Let us be faithful to what\
we have believed and know.\
2:24\
If we have not been living\
according to our knowledge,\
2:29\
let us change.\
2:31\
Sinners who persist\
in their sins\
2:34\
and do not repent sink deeper\
and deeper into filthiness\
2:39\
until Satan claims\
them for himself,\
2:43\
significantly jeopardizing\
their opportunity\
2:47\
to repent, to be forgiven,\
and to be blessed with all\
2:52\
the blessings of eternity.\
2:55\
I have heard many\
justifications from those\
3:00\
who have stopped participating\
actively in the Church\
3:04\
and have lost the correct vision\
of the purpose of our journey\
3:09\
on this earth.\
3:10\
I exhort them to\
reflect and to return,\
3:15\
because I believe that no one\
will be able to make excuses\
3:22\
before our Lord Jesus Christ.\
3:26\
When we were baptized, we made\
covenants--not with any man\
3:31\
but with the Savior, agreeing to\
"take upon [ourselves] the name\
3:37\
of Jesus Christ, having a\
determination to serve him\
3:42\
to the end."\
3:43\
Attendance at sacrament\
meetings is one of the key ways\
3:48\
we can evaluate our\
determination to serve Him,\
3:52\
our spiritual fortitude,\
and the growth\
3:57\
of our faith in Jesus Christ.\
4:01\
Partaking of the sacrament\
is the most important thing\
4:04\
we do on the Sabbath day.\
4:07\
The Lord explained this\
ordinance to His Apostles\
4:12\
just before He died.\
4:14\
He did the same on the\
American continent.\
4:18\
He tells us that if we\
participate in this ordinance,\
4:23\
it will be a testimony\
to the Father\
4:26\
that we always\
remember Him, and He\
4:30\
promises that,\
accordingly, we will\
4:34\
have His Spirit to be with us.\
4:38\
In the teachings of Alma the\
Younger to his son Shiblon,\
4:41\
we find wise\
counsel and warnings\
4:45\
that help us remain\
faithful to our covenants:\
4:49\
"See that ye are not\
lifted up unto pride; yea,\
4:54\
see that ye do not boast\
in your own wisdom,\
4:58\
nor of your much strength.\
5:01\
"Use boldness, but\
not overbearance;\
5:04\
and also see that ye\
bridle all your passions,\
5:08\
that ye may be filled\
with love; see that ye\
5:12\
refrain from idleness."\
5:16\
Several years ago,\
while on vacation,\
5:18\
I wanted to go kayaking\
for the first time.\
5:22\
I rented a kayak, and\
full of enthusiasm,\
5:26\
I launched into the sea.\
5:29\
After a few minutes, a\
wave overturned the kayak.\
5:32\
With a great deal of effort,\
holding the paddle in one hand\
5:37\
and the kayak in the other,\
I could regain my footing.\
5:42\
I tried again to\
paddle my kayak,\
5:44\
but just a few minutes later\
the kayak tipped over again.\
5:50\
I stubbornly kept on\
trying, to no avail,\
5:55\
until someone who understood\
kayaking told me that there\
5:59\
must be a crack in the\
shell and the kayak\
6:02\
must have filled up\
with water, making\
6:06\
it unstable and\
impossible to control.\
6:10\
I dragged the kayak to the\
shore and removed the plug,\
6:14\
and sure enough, out came\
a large amount of water.\
6:19\
I think that at times\
we move through life\
6:23\
with sins that, like\
the leak in my kayak,\
6:27\
impede our spiritual progress.\
6:31\
If we persist in our sins,\
we forget the covenants\
6:35\
we have made with the\
Lord, even though we\
6:39\
keep capsizing because\
of the imbalance\
6:42\
that those sins\
create in our lives.\
6:46\
Like the cracks in my kayak,\
the cracks in our lives\
6:49\
need to be dealt with.\
6:51\
Some sins will require\
more efforts than others\
6:56\
to repent of.\
6:58\
We should therefore\
ask ourselves:\
7:00\
Where are we\
regarding our attitude\
7:04\
toward the Savior and His work?\
7:06\
Are we in Peter's situation\
when he denied Jesus Christ?\
7:11\
Or have we advanced\
to the point where\
7:15\
we have the attitude\
and determination\
7:18\
he had after the\
great commission\
7:21\
he received from the Savior?\
7:25\
We must strive to obey\
all the commandments\
7:28\
and pay close\
attention to those that\
7:30\
are hardest for us to keep.\
7:33\
The Lord will be at\
our side, helping us\
7:37\
in times of need and weakness,\
and if we demonstrate a sincere\
7:42\
desire and act\
accordingly, He will make\
7:46\
"weak things become strong."\
7:50\
Obedience will give us the\
strength to overcome sin.\
7:55\
We must also understand\
that the trial of our faith\
7:59\
requires us to obey, often\
without knowing the results.\
8:05\
I suggest a formula that will\
help us endure to the end:\
8:09\
1.\
8:10\
Daily, pray and\
read the scriptures.\
8:13\
2.\
8:13\
Weekly, partake of the\
sacrament with a broken heart\
8:17\
and a contrite spirit.\
8:19\
3.\
8:19\
Pay our tithing and our\
monthly fast offering.\
8:23\
4.\
8:24\
Every two years--every year\
for the youth--renew our temple\
8:29\
recommends.\
8:30\
5.\
8:30\
Throughout our whole lives,\
serve in the work of the Lord.\
8:36\
May the great truths of the\
gospel steady our minds,\
8:40\
and may we keep our lives\
free of the cracks that\
8:44\
can impede our safe journey\
through the sea of this life.\
8:52\
Success in the Lord's\
way has a price,\
8:54\
and the only way to achieve\
it is to pay that price.\
9:02\
How grateful I am that our\
Savior endured unto the end,\
9:06\
completing His great\
atoning sacrifice.\
9:11\
He suffered for our sins,\
pains, depressions, anguish,\
9:15\
infirmities, and\
fears, and so He\
9:17\
knows how to help us, how to\
inspire us, how to comfort us,\
9:23\
and how to strengthen us so\
that we may endure and obtain\
9:28\
the crown that is reserved for\
those who are not defeated.\
9:34\
Life is different\
for each of us.\
9:36\
We all have a time of\
trials, a time for happiness,\
9:40\
a time for making decisions, a\
time for overcoming obstacles,\
9:45\
and a time for taking\
advantage of opportunities.\
9:49\
Whatever our personal\
situations may be,\
9:52\
I testify that our Heavenly\
Father is constantly\
9:57\
saying, "I love you.\
10:03\
I sustain you.\
10:04\
I am with you.\
10:06\
Do not give up.\
10:08\
Repent and endure in the\
path that I have shown you.\
10:12\
And I assure you that we\
will see each other again\
10:17\
in our celestial home."\
10:19\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
