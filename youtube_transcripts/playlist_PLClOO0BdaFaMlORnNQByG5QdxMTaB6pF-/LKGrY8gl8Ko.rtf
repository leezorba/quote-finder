Brothers and sisters, I\
rejoice with you in the gospel,\
0:05\
or the doctrine of Christ.\
0:07\
A friend once asked\
Elder Neil L. Andersen,\
0:10\
then of the Seventy,\
how it felt to speak\
0:13\
in front of 21,000 people\
at the Conference Center.\
0:16\
Elder Andersen\
replied, "It is not\
0:19\
the 21,000 people\
who make you nervous;\
0:22\
it is the 15 Brethren\
seated behind you."\
0:28\
I chuckled then,\
but I feel it now.\
0:33\
How I love and sustain these\
15 men as prophets, seers,\
0:37\
and revelators.\
0:39\
The Lord told Abraham that\
through his seed and through\
0:42\
the priesthood, all the families\
of the earth would be blessed\
0:46\
with the "blessings\
of the Gospel, ...\
0:48\
even of life eternal."\
0:50\
These promised blessings of\
the gospel and the priesthood\
0:53\
were restored to the\
earth, and then in 1842\
0:58\
the Prophet Joseph Smith\
administered the endowment\
1:00\
to a limited number\
of men and women.\
1:03\
Mercy Fielding Thompson\
was one of them.\
1:06\
The Prophet said to\
her, "This [endowment]\
1:10\
will bring you out of darkness\
into marvelous light."\
1:15\
Today I want to focus on saving\
ordinances--which will bring\
1:19\
you and me marvelous light.\
1:24\
IN TRUE TO THE FAITH\
WE READ: "An ordinance\
1:26\
is a sacred, formal act\
performed by the authority\
1:29\
of the priesthood.\
1:30\
[The] ordinances [that] are\
essential to our exaltation ...\
1:33\
are called saving ordinances.\
1:36\
They include baptism,\
confirmation,\
1:41\
ordination to the Melchizedek\
Priesthood (for men),\
1:44\
the temple endowment, and\
the marriage sealing."\
1:49\
Elder David A. Bednar taught,\
"The ordinances of salvation\
1:53\
and exaltation administered in\
the Lord's restored Church ...\
1:57\
constitute authorized channels\
through which the blessings\
2:00\
and powers of heaven can flow\
into our individual lives."\
2:06\
Like two sides to a coin,\
all the saving ordinances\
2:08\
are accompanied by\
covenants with God.\
2:11\
God promised us blessings\
if we faithfully\
2:14\
honor those covenants.\
2:16\
The prophet Amulek declared,\
"This ... is the time ...\
2:20\
to prepare to meet God."\
2:22\
How do we prepare?\
2:24\
By worthily\
receiving ordinances.\
2:28\
We must also, in President\
Russell M. Nelson's words,\
2:32\
"keep on the covenant path."\
2:34\
President Nelson\
continued, "Your commitment\
2:37\
to follow the Savior by\
making covenants with Him\
2:40\
and then keeping\
those covenants will\
2:43\
open the door to every\
spiritual blessing\
2:45\
and privilege available to\
men, women, and children\
2:50\
everywhere."\
2:52\
John and Bonnie Newman,\
like many of you,\
2:54\
are recipients of the\
spiritual blessings\
2:57\
President Nelson promised.\
2:59\
One Sunday, after attending\
church with her three young\
3:02\
children, Bonnie said to\
John, who was not a member\
3:05\
of the Church, "I cannot\
do this on my own.\
3:09\
You need to decide whether\
you come to my church\
3:12\
with us or you choose a church\
that we can go to together,\
3:16\
but the children need to know\
that their dad loves God too."\
3:22\
The following Sunday\
and every Sunday\
3:24\
after, John not only\
attended; he also served,\
3:29\
playing the piano for many\
wards, branches, and Primaries\
3:33\
over the years.\
3:34\
I had the privilege of meeting\
with John in April 2015,\
3:38\
and in that meeting we\
discussed that the best\
3:42\
way he could manifest\
his love for Bonnie\
3:44\
was to take her to the\
temple, but that could not\
3:47\
happen unless he was baptized.\
3:52\
After attending The\
Church of Jesus Christ\
3:54\
of Latter-day\
Saints for 39 years,\
3:57\
John was baptized in 2015.\
4:00\
A year later John\
and Bonnie were\
4:03\
sealed in the Memphis\
Tennessee Temple,\
4:05\
20 years after she had\
received her own endowment.\
4:09\
Their 47-year-old son,\
Robert, said of his dad,\
4:13\
"Dad has really, really\
blossomed since he\
4:16\
received the priesthood."\
4:18\
Bonnie added, "John has always\
been a happy and cheerful\
4:23\
person, but receiving\
the ordinances\
4:26\
and honoring his covenants\
has enhanced his gentleness."\
4:31\
Many years ago, President\
Boyd K. Packer warned,\
4:34\
"Good conduct without the\
ordinances of the gospel\
4:38\
will neither redeem\
nor exalt mankind."\
4:42\
In fact, we need not only\
the ordinances and covenants\
4:46\
to return to our\
Father, but we also\
4:49\
need His Son, Jesus\
Christ, and His Atonement.\
4:52\
King Benjamin\
taught that only in\
4:55\
and through the name of\
Christ can salvation come unto\
4:57\
the children of men.\
4:59\
Through His Atonement,\
Jesus Christ\
5:02\
redeemed us from\
the consequences\
5:04\
of the Fall of Adam and\
made possible our repentance\
5:07\
and eventual exaltation.\
5:09\
Through His life, He set the\
example for us to receive\
5:13\
saving ordinances--in which\
"the power of godliness is\
5:17\
manifest."\
5:19\
After the Savior received\
the ordinance of baptism\
5:21\
to "fulfil all righteousness,"\
Satan tempted Him.\
5:26\
Likewise, our\
temptations do not end\
5:30\
after baptism or sealing, but\
receiving the sacred ordinances\
5:35\
and honoring the associated\
covenants fill us\
5:38\
with marvelous light and give us\
strength to resist and overcome\
5:43\
temptations.\
5:45\
Isaiah prophesied that\
in the latter days,\
5:49\
"the earth also is defiled\
... because they have ...\
5:52\
changed the ordinance."\
5:56\
A related warning, revealed\
to the Prophet Joseph Smith,\
5:58\
was that some "draw near to\
[the Lord] with their lips, ...\
6:02\
they teach for doctrines\
the commandments of men,\
6:05\
having a form of godliness, but\
they deny the power thereof."\
6:10\
Paul also warned that many\
would have "a form of godliness,\
6:15\
but [deny] the power thereof:\
from such turn away."\
6:20\
I repeat, from such turn away.\
6:25\
The many distractions\
and temptations of life\
6:27\
are like "ravening wolves."\
6:30\
It is the true shepherd who\
will prepare, protect, and warn\
6:35\
the sheep in the flock when\
these wolves are approaching.\
6:39\
As undershepherds\
who seek to emulate\
6:42\
the perfect life of\
the Good Shepherd,\
6:44\
aren't we shepherds of our\
own soul as well as of others?\
6:48\
With the counsel of prophets,\
seers, and revelators,\
6:52\
whom we just sustained,\
and with the power and gift\
6:55\
of the Holy Ghost, we can\
see the wolves coming if we\
6:59\
are watchful and prepared.\
7:02\
In contrast, when we are a\
casual shepherd of our own soul\
7:07\
and others' souls,\
casualties are likely.\
7:11\
Casualness leads to casualties.\
7:15\
I invite us to each be\
a faithful shepherd.\
7:20\
The sacrament is an ordinance\
that helps us stay on the path,\
7:24\
and worthily\
partaking is evidence\
7:26\
that we are keeping the\
covenants associated\
7:28\
with all the other ordinances.\
7:31\
A few years ago, while\
my wife, Anita, and I\
7:33\
were serving in the Arkansas\
Little Rock Mission,\
7:36\
I went out to teach with\
two young missionaries.\
7:39\
During the lesson, the good\
brother we were teaching\
7:42\
said, "I have been to\
your church; why do you\
7:46\
have to eat bread and\
drink water every Sunday?\
7:49\
In our church, we do it twice\
a year, Easter and Christmas,\
7:54\
and that is very meaningful."\
7:57\
We shared with him that we are\
commanded to "meet together oft\
8:01\
to partake of bread and wine."\
8:03\
We read out loud Matthew\
26 and 3 Nephi chapter 18.\
8:08\
He responded that he still\
did not see the necessity.\
8:13\
We then shared the following\
comparison: "Imagine you\
8:17\
are involved in a very\
serious car accident.\
8:20\
You have been injured\
and are unconscious.\
8:24\
Someone runs by, seeing\
that you are unconscious,\
8:28\
dials the emergency number, 911.\
8:31\
You are attended to and\
regain consciousness."\
8:34\
We asked this\
brother, "When you are\
8:37\
able to recognize\
your surroundings,\
8:39\
what questions will you have?"\
8:42\
He said, "I will want\
to know how I got there\
8:46\
and who found me.\
8:47\
I will want to thank him every\
day because he saved my life."\
8:53\
We shared with this good brother\
how the Savior saved our lives\
8:57\
and how we need to thank\
Him every day, every day,\
9:00\
every day!\
9:02\
We then asked, "Knowing that He\
gave His life for you and us,\
9:06\
how often do you\
want to eat the bread\
9:09\
and drink the water as emblems\
of His body and blood?"\
9:13\
He said, "I get it, I get\
it, but one more thing.\
9:18\
Your church is not\
lively like ours."\
9:23\
To that we responded,\
"What would you\
9:26\
do if the Savior Jesus Christ\
walked through that door?"\
9:31\
He said, "Immediately, I\
would go down to my knees."\
9:37\
We asked, "Isn't that what\
you feel when you walk\
9:41\
into Latter-day Saint\
chapels--reverence\
9:43\
for the Savior?"\
9:45\
He said, "I get it,\
I get it, I get it!"\
9:51\
He showed up at church\
that Easter Sunday\
9:53\
and kept returning.\
9:55\
I invite each of us\
to ask ourselves,\
9:58\
"What ordinances,\
including the sacrament,\
10:01\
do I need to receive,\
and what covenants do I\
10:05\
need to make, keep, and honor?"\
10:08\
I promise that\
participating in ordinances\
10:11\
and honoring the\
associated covenants\
10:14\
will bring you marvelous\
light and protection\
10:17\
in this ever-darkening world.\
10:19\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
