One of the most remarkable\
creatures on earth\
0:04\
is the monarch butterfly.\
0:06\
On a trip to Mexico to spend\
Christmas with my husband's\
0:09\
family, we visited a\
butterfly sanctuary,\
0:13\
where millions of monarch\
butterflies spend the winter.\
0:16\
It was fascinating to see\
such an impressive sight\
0:20\
and for us to reflect\
on the example of unity\
0:24\
and obedience to\
divine laws that God's\
0:27\
creations demonstrate.\
0:29\
Monarch butterflies\
are master navigators.\
0:32\
They use the sun's\
position to find\
0:35\
the direction they need to go.\
0:37\
Every spring, they travel\
thousands of miles from Mexico\
0:41\
to Canada, and every fall, they\
return to the same sacred fir\
0:46\
forests in Mexico.\
0:48\
They do this year after year,\
one tiny wing flap at a time.\
0:54\
During their journey,\
they cluster together\
0:57\
at night on trees to protect\
themselves from the cold\
1:02\
and from predators.\
1:04\
A group of butterflies\
is called a kaleidoscope.\
1:07\
Isn't that a beautiful image?\
1:10\
Each butterfly in a kaleidoscope\
is unique and different,\
1:14\
yet these seemingly\
fragile creatures\
1:17\
have been designed by a loving\
Creator with the ability\
1:21\
to survive, travel, multiply,\
and disseminate life\
1:25\
as they go from one flower to\
the next, spreading pollen.\
1:30\
And although each\
butterfly is different,\
1:33\
they work together to\
make the world a more\
1:36\
beautiful and fruitful place.\
1:40\
Like the monarch butterflies,\
we are on a journey\
1:43\
back to our heavenly home,\
where we will reunite\
1:46\
with our Heavenly Parents.\
1:48\
Like the butterflies, we have\
been given divine attributes\
1:53\
that allow us to navigate\
through life in order\
1:56\
to "[fill] the measure\
of [our] creation."\
1:59\
Like them, if we knit\
our hearts together,\
2:03\
the Lord will protect\
us "as a hen [gathers]\
2:06\
her chickens under her\
wings" and will make us\
2:09\
into a beautiful kaleidoscope.\
2:12\
Girls and boys, young women\
and young men, sisters\
2:17\
and brothers, we are on\
this journey together.\
2:21\
In order to reach our sublime\
destiny, we need each other,\
2:26\
and we need to be unified.\
2:28\
The Lord has commanded us, "Be\
one; and if ye are not one ye\
2:34\
are not mine."\
2:37\
Jesus Christ is the\
ultimate example\
2:40\
of unity with His Father.\
2:41\
They are one in\
purpose, in love,\
2:44\
and in works, with\
"the will of the Son\
2:47\
being swallowed up in\
the will of the Father."\
2:51\
How can we follow the Lord's\
perfect example of unity\
2:54\
with His Father\
and be more unified\
2:57\
with Them and with each other?\
3:01\
An inspiring pattern\
is found in Acts 1:14.\
3:05\
We read, "[The men] all\
continued with one accord\
3:11\
in prayer and supplication,\
with the women."\
3:15\
I think it is significant that\
the phrase "with one accord"\
3:19\
appears several times in the\
book of Acts, where we read\
3:23\
about what Jesus Christ's\
followers did immediately\
3:26\
after He ascended to heaven\
as a resurrected being,\
3:30\
as well as the\
blessings they received\
3:33\
because of their efforts.\
3:35\
It is also significant that\
we find a similar pattern\
3:40\
among the faithful of\
the American continent\
3:43\
at the time the Lord visited\
and ministered to them.\
3:47\
"With one accord" means in\
agreement, in unity, and all\
3:52\
together.\
3:54\
Some of the things that the\
faithful Saints did in unity\
3:57\
in both places were that they\
testified of Jesus Christ,\
4:01\
studied the word of God,\
and ministered to each other\
4:05\
with love.\
4:07\
The Lord's followers were one in\
purpose, in love, and in works.\
4:11\
They knew who they were, they\
knew what they had to do,\
4:15\
and they did it with love\
for God and for each other.\
4:19\
They were part of a magnificent\
kaleidoscope moving forward\
4:23\
with one accord.\
4:25\
Some of the blessings\
they received\
4:27\
were that they were filled\
with the Holy Ghost,\
4:30\
miracles took place among\
them, the Church grew,\
4:34\
there was no contention\
among the people,\
4:37\
and the Lord blessed\
them in all things.\
4:40\
We can suppose that the\
reason why they were so united\
4:44\
is because they knew\
the Lord personally.\
4:48\
They had been close\
to Him, and they\
4:50\
had been witnesses of His\
divine mission, of the miracles\
4:54\
that He performed, and\
of His Resurrection.\
4:58\
They saw and touched the\
marks in His hands and feet.\
5:02\
They knew with certainty that\
He was the promised Messiah,\
5:07\
the Redeemer of the world.\
5:10\
They knew that "He is the\
source of all healing, peace,\
5:15\
and eternal progress."\
5:17\
Even though we may have\
not seen our Savior\
5:20\
with our physical eyes,\
we can know that He lives.\
5:24\
As we draw closer\
to Him, as we seek\
5:28\
to receive a personal witness\
through the Holy Ghost\
5:31\
of His divine mission, we will\
have a better understanding\
5:35\
of our purpose; the love of\
God will dwell in our hearts;\
5:40\
we will have the\
determination to be\
5:43\
one in the kaleidoscopes\
of our families, wards,\
5:46\
and communities; and we\
will minister to each other\
5:50\
"in newer, better ways."\
5:54\
Miracles happen when\
the children of God work\
5:57\
together guided by the Spirit\
to reach out to others in need.\
6:02\
We hear so many stories\
of neighborly love\
6:05\
shown among the people\
when catastrophe strikes.\
6:09\
For example, when\
the city of Houston\
6:12\
suffered a massive\
flood last year,\
6:14\
people forgot about their own\
needs and went to the rescue.\
6:19\
An elders quorum president\
sent a call for help\
6:22\
to the community, and a fleet of\
77 boats was quickly organized.\
6:28\
Rescuers went around the\
affected neighborhoods\
6:31\
and transported whole families\
to one of our meetinghouses,\
6:35\
where they received refuge\
and much needed help.\
6:39\
Members and nonmembers worked\
together with one purpose.\
6:45\
In Santiago, Chile, a\
Relief Society president\
6:48\
had the desire to help\
immigrants in her community who\
6:52\
had come from Haiti.\
6:54\
By counseling together with\
her priesthood leaders,\
6:57\
she and other leaders\
came up with the idea\
7:00\
to offer Spanish classes\
to those immigrants,\
7:03\
helping them integrate\
better into their new home.\
7:06\
Every Saturday morning,\
missionaries gather together\
7:11\
with their eager students.\
7:12\
The feeling of unity\
in that building\
7:16\
is an inspiring example of\
people from diverse backgrounds\
7:20\
serving with one accord.\
7:23\
In Mexico, hundreds of\
members traveled for hours\
7:27\
to help the survivors of\
two major earthquakes.\
7:30\
They came with tools, machinery,\
and love for their neighbor.\
7:36\
As volunteers gathered together\
in one of our meetinghouses\
7:39\
waiting for instructions, the\
mayor of the city of Ixhuatan\
7:44\
broke down in tears as he\
saw such a manifestation\
7:48\
of "the pure love of Christ."\
7:51\
The Lord is now giving us the\
opportunity to counsel together\
7:55\
each month in our priesthood\
quorums and Relief Societies\
7:58\
so we can all be more active\
participants in our ward\
8:03\
or branch kaleidoscope--a place\
where we all fit in and where\
8:08\
we are all needed.\
8:11\
Every one of our\
paths is different,\
8:14\
yet we walk them together.\
8:17\
Our path is not about\
what we have done\
8:20\
or where we have been; it\
is about where we are going\
8:25\
and what we are\
becoming, in unity.\
8:28\
When we counsel together\
guided by the Holy Ghost,\
8:32\
we can see where we are\
and where we need to be.\
8:36\
The Holy Ghost gives us a vision\
that our natural eyes cannot\
8:40\
see, because "revelation\
is scattered among us,"\
8:44\
and when we put that revelation\
together, we can see more.\
8:50\
As we work in unity,\
our purpose should\
8:52\
be to look for and\
do the Lord's will;\
8:55\
our incentive should\
be the love we\
8:58\
feel for God and\
for our neighbor;\
9:01\
and our greatest desire should\
be to "labor diligently"\
9:05\
so we can prepare the way\
for the glorious return\
9:08\
of our Savior.\
9:09\
The only way we will be able\
to do so is "with one accord."\
9:15\
Like the monarch butterflies,\
let us continue on our journey\
9:19\
together in purpose, each of\
us with our own attributes\
9:23\
and contributions, working\
to make this a more beautiful\
9:27\
and fruitful world--one small\
step at a time and in harmony\
9:34\
with God's commandments.\
9:36\
Our Lord Jesus Christ\
has promised us\
9:38\
that when we are gathered\
together in His name,\
9:41\
He is in the midst of us.\
9:43\
I testify that He\
lives and that He\
9:46\
was resurrected on a beautiful\
spring morning like today.\
9:50\
He is the Monarch above all\
monarchs, "the King of kings,\
9:56\
[the] Lord of lords."\
9:58\
May we be one in the Father\
and in His Begotten Son,\
10:01\
as we are guided\
by the Holy Ghost,\
10:04\
is my humble prayer in the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
