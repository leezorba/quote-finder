My dear brothers and\
sisters, like you,\
0:05\
I have been profoundly touched\
and edified and inspired\
0:12\
by the messages and music\
and the feelings of this time\
0:19\
together.\
0:21\
I'm sure I speak for\
you in expressing thanks\
0:25\
to our brothers and\
sisters who, as instruments\
0:30\
in the hands of the Lord, have\
given us the strengthening\
0:34\
effect of this time together.\
0:41\
I'm grateful to speak to this\
audience on Easter Sunday.\
0:45\
Today we join other Christians\
in celebrating the Resurrection\
0:51\
of the Lord Jesus Christ.\
0:54\
For members of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
0:58\
Saints, the literal\
Resurrection of Jesus Christ\
1:03\
is a pillar of our faith.\
1:05\
Because we believe the accounts\
in both the Bible and the Book\
1:11\
of Mormon about the literal\
Resurrection of Jesus Christ,\
1:15\
we also believe the numerous\
scriptural teachings\
1:19\
that a similar resurrection will\
come to all mortals who have\
1:25\
ever lived upon this earth.\
1:28\
That resurrection gives\
us what the Apostle Peter\
1:31\
called "a lively hope."\
1:34\
That lively hope\
is our conviction\
1:38\
that death is not the\
conclusion of our identity\
1:43\
but merely a necessary step\
in our Heavenly Father's\
1:47\
merciful plan for the\
salvation of His children.\
1:52\
That plan calls for a transition\
from mortality to immortality.\
1:59\
Central to that transition\
is the sunset of death\
2:05\
and the glorious morning made\
possible by the Resurrection\
2:09\
of our Lord and Savior that\
we celebrate on this Easter\
2:14\
Sunday.\
2:16\
In a great hymn whose words\
were written by Eliza R. Snow,\
2:20\
we sing:\
2:22\
"How great, how\
glorious, how complete\
2:26\
Redemption's grand design,\
2:30\
Where justice,\
love, and mercy meet\
2:34\
In harmony divine!"\
2:38\
In furtherance of that\
divine design and harmony,\
2:43\
we assemble in meetings,\
including this conference,\
2:47\
to teach and\
encourage one another.\
2:51\
This morning I have\
felt to use as my text\
2:54\
Alma's teaching to\
his son Helaman,\
2:57\
recorded in the Book of\
Mormon: "By small and simple\
3:03\
things are great things\
brought to pass."\
3:09\
We are taught many\
small and simple things\
3:11\
in the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
3:14\
We need to be\
reminded that in total\
3:18\
and over a significant\
period of time,\
3:20\
these seemingly small things\
bring to pass great things.\
3:26\
There have been many\
talks on this subject\
3:29\
by General Authorities and\
by other respected teachers.\
3:33\
The subject is so important that\
I feel to speak of it again.\
3:38\
I was reminded of the power\
of small and simple things\
3:42\
over time by something\
I saw on a morning walk.\
3:47\
Here is the picture I took.\
3:52\
The thick and strong concrete\
sidewalk is cracking.\
3:57\
Is this the result of some\
large and powerful thrust?\
4:02\
No, this cracking is caused\
by the slow, small growth\
4:08\
of one of the roots reaching\
out from the adjoining tree.\
4:14\
Here is a similar example\
I saw on another street.\
4:20\
The thrusting power that cracked\
these heavy concrete sidewalks\
4:25\
was too small to measure on a\
daily or even a monthly basis,\
4:30\
but its effect over time\
was incredibly powerful.\
4:37\
So is the powerful\
effect over time\
4:39\
of the small and simple things\
we are taught in the scriptures\
4:43\
and by living prophets.\
4:45\
Consider the\
scripture study we've\
4:48\
been taught to incorporate\
into our daily lives.\
4:52\
Or consider the personal prayers\
and the kneeling family prayers\
4:58\
that are regular practices for\
faithful Latter-day Saints.\
5:03\
Consider attendance at\
seminary for youth or institute\
5:08\
classes for young adults.\
5:11\
Though each of\
these practices may\
5:14\
seem to be small and\
simple, over time\
5:18\
they result in powerful\
spiritual uplift and growth.\
5:23\
This occurs because each of\
these small and simple things\
5:28\
invites the companionship of the\
Holy Ghost, the Testifier, who\
5:35\
enlightens us and\
guides us into truth,\
5:40\
as President Eyring\
has explained.\
5:45\
Another source of\
spiritual uplift and growth\
5:48\
is an ongoing practice\
of repenting, even\
5:53\
of seemingly small\
transgressions.\
5:56\
Our own inspired\
self-evaluations\
6:00\
can help us see how\
we have fallen short\
6:03\
and how we can do better.\
6:06\
Such repentance should\
precede our weekly partaking\
6:11\
of the sacrament.\
6:12\
Some subjects to\
consider in this process\
6:16\
of repentance are\
suggested in the hymn\
6:19\
"Have I Done Any Good?":\
6:23\
"Have I done any good\
in the world today?\
6:27\
Have I helped anyone in need?\
6:30\
Have I cheered up the sad and\
[helped] someone feel glad?\
6:36\
If not, I have failed indeed.\
6:40\
Has anyone's burden\
been lighter today\
6:43\
Because I was willing to share?\
6:46\
Have the sick and the weary\
been helped on their way?\
6:50\
When they needed my\
help was I there?"\
6:56\
Surely these are small things,\
but surely they are good\
6:59\
examples of what Alma\
taught his son Helaman:\
7:03\
"And the Lord God doth work by\
means to bring about his great\
7:09\
and eternal purposes; and by\
very small means the Lord ...\
7:14\
bringeth about the\
salvation of many souls."\
7:20\
President Steven C.\
Wheelwright gave an audience\
7:23\
at Brigham Young\
University-Hawaii\
7:26\
this inspired description\
of Alma's teaching:\
7:33\
"Alma confirms for his son\
that indeed the pattern\
7:36\
the Lord follows when\
we exercise faith in Him\
7:41\
and follow His counsel in\
the small and simple things\
7:45\
is that he blesses us with small\
daily miracles, and over time,\
7:52\
with marvelous works."\
7:56\
Elder Howard W. Hunter\
taught that "frequently it is\
8:00\
the commonplace tasks ... that\
have the greatest positive\
8:04\
effect on the lives of others,\
as compared with the things\
8:08\
that the world so often\
relates to greatness."\
8:14\
A persuasive secular teaching\
of this same principle\
8:17\
comes from former Senator\
Dan Coats of Indiana,\
8:21\
who wrote, "The only preparation\
for that one profound decision\
8:27\
which can change a\
life, or even a nation,\
8:31\
is those hundreds and\
thousands of half-conscious,\
8:36\
self-defining, seemingly\
insignificant decisions made\
8:42\
in private."\
8:46\
Those "seemingly insignificant"\
private decisions\
8:50\
include how we\
use our time, what\
8:54\
we view on television and\
the internet, what we read,\
8:59\
the art and music with\
which we surround ourselves\
9:03\
at work and at home, what\
we seek for entertainment,\
9:08\
and how we apply our commitment\
to be honest and truthful.\
9:14\
Another seemingly\
small and simple thing\
9:16\
is being civil and cheerful\
in our personal interactions.\
9:23\
None of these desirable\
small and simple things\
9:27\
will lift us to great things\
unless they are practiced\
9:31\
consistently and continuously.\
9:34\
President Brigham\
Young was reported\
9:37\
as saying, "Our\
lives are made up\
9:40\
of little, simple circumstances\
that amount to a great deal\
9:45\
when they are brought\
together, and sum up\
9:47\
the whole life of\
the man or woman."\
9:53\
We are surrounded\
by media influences\
9:56\
and cultural\
deteriorations that will\
10:00\
carry us downstream\
in our values\
10:03\
if we are not\
continually resisting.\
10:08\
To move upstream toward\
our eternal goal,\
10:12\
we must constantly\
keep paddling.\
10:17\
It helps if we are part of a\
team who are paddling together,\
10:21\
like a rowing crew in action.\
10:24\
To extend that\
example even further,\
10:27\
the cultural currents are\
so strong that if we ever\
10:33\
stop paddling, we will\
be carried downstream\
10:37\
toward a destination\
we do not seek\
10:40\
but which becomes inevitable\
if we do not constantly\
10:45\
try to move forward.\
10:50\
After reciting a\
seemingly small event\
10:52\
that had great\
consequences, Nephi wrote,\
10:55\
"And thus we see\
that by small means\
10:58\
the Lord can bring\
about great things."\
11:01\
The Old Testament includes\
a memorable example of this.\
11:05\
There we read how the Israelites\
were plagued by fiery serpents.\
11:10\
Many people died\
from their bites.\
11:14\
When Moses prayed\
for relief, he was\
11:16\
inspired to make "a serpent of\
brass, and put it upon a pole."\
11:22\
Then, "if a serpent had\
bitten any man, when\
11:27\
he beheld the serpent\
of brass, he lived."\
11:31\
Such a small thing for\
such a miraculous result!\
11:36\
Yet, as Nephi explained when\
he taught this example to those\
11:40\
who were rebelling\
against the Lord,\
11:43\
even when the Lord had prepared\
a simple way by which they\
11:48\
could be healed, "because of\
the simpleness of the way,\
11:54\
or the easiness of it, there\
were many who perished."\
12:01\
That example and that teaching\
remind us that the simplicity\
12:05\
of the way or the easiness of\
the commanded task cannot mean\
12:11\
that it is unimportant to\
achieve our righteous desire.\
12:15\
Similarly, even small acts of\
disobedience or minor failures\
12:21\
to follow righteous\
practices can draw us down\
12:25\
toward an outcome we have\
been warned to avoid.\
12:28\
The Word of Wisdom provides\
an example of this.\
12:32\
Likely the effect on the body\
of one cigarette or one drink\
12:37\
of alcohol or one dose\
of another drug cannot be\
12:41\
measured.\
12:42\
But over time, the\
effect is powerful\
12:46\
and may be irreversible.\
12:49\
Remember the cracking\
of the sidewalk\
12:51\
by the gradual small expansions\
of the root of the tree.\
12:56\
One thing is certain:\
the terrible consequences\
13:01\
of partaking of anything\
that can become addictive,\
13:05\
like drugs that attack our\
bodies or pornographic material\
13:10\
that degrades our thoughts, is\
totally avoidable if we never\
13:17\
partake for the first\
time--even once.\
13:21\
Many years ago, Elder\
M. Russell Ballard\
13:24\
described to a general\
conference audience\
13:27\
"how small and simple things\
can be negative and destructive\
13:31\
to a person's salvation."\
13:33\
He taught: "Like\
weak fibers that\
13:37\
form a yarn, then a\
strand, and finally a rope,\
13:41\
these small things\
combined together\
13:44\
can become too\
strong to be broken.\
13:47\
We must ever be\
aware of the power\
13:50\
that the small and simple\
things can have in building\
13:53\
spirituality," he said.\
13:55\
"At the same time,\
we must be aware\
13:58\
that Satan will use small\
and simple things to lead us\
14:02\
into despair and misery."\
14:07\
President Wheelwright gave\
a similar caution to his\
14:10\
BYU-Hawaii audience: "It is\
in failing to do the small\
14:14\
and simple things that faith\
wavers, miracles cease,\
14:19\
and progress [toward] the Lord\
and His kingdom is first put\
14:23\
on hold ... then begins to\
unravel as seeking after\
14:27\
the kingdom of God is replaced\
with more temporal pursuits\
14:32\
and worldly ambitions."\
14:37\
To protect against the\
cumulative negative effects\
14:40\
that are destructive to\
our spiritual progress,\
14:43\
we need to follow\
the spiritual pattern\
14:46\
of small and simple things.\
14:48\
Elder David A. Bednar described\
this principle in a BYU\
14:53\
Women's Conference: "We can\
learn much about the nature\
14:57\
and importance of this spiritual\
pattern from the technique\
15:01\
of ... dripping water onto\
the soil at very low rates,"\
15:05\
in contrast to flooding or\
spraying large quantities\
15:09\
of water where it\
may not be needed.\
15:11\
He explained:\
15:14\
"The steady drips of water\
sink deep into the ground\
15:17\
and provide a high\
moisture level in the soil\
15:20\
wherein plants can flourish.\
15:23\
In like manner, if you and\
I are focused and frequent\
15:28\
in receiving consistent drops\
of spiritual nourishment,\
15:32\
then gospel roots can\
sink deep into our soul,\
15:37\
can become firmly\
established and grounded,\
15:39\
and can produce extraordinary\
and delicious fruit.\
15:44\
Continuing, he said,\
"The spiritual pattern\
15:48\
of small and simple things\
bringing forth great things\
15:52\
produces firmness and\
steadfastness, deepening\
15:55\
devotion, and more complete\
conversion to the [gospel of]\
15:59\
Jesus Christ."\
16:04\
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught\
this principle in words now\
16:07\
included in the\
Doctrine and Covenants:\
16:10\
"Let no man count them\
as [simple] things;\
16:13\
for there is much ...\
pertaining to the saints,\
16:16\
which depends upon\
these things."\
16:21\
In connection with\
the earliest attempts\
16:23\
to establish the Church in\
Missouri, the Lord counseled\
16:27\
patience, for "all things must\
come to pass in their time."\
16:32\
Then He gave this\
great teaching:\
16:34\
"Wherefore, be not\
weary in well-doing,\
16:38\
for ye are laying the\
foundation of a great work.\
16:41\
And out of small\
things proceedeth\
16:43\
that which is great."\
16:48\
I believe we all desire to\
follow President Russell M.\
16:51\
Nelson's challenge to press\
forward "on the covenant path."\
16:56\
Our commitment to do\
so is strengthened\
17:00\
by consistently following\
the "small things" we\
17:05\
are taught by the\
gospel of Jesus Christ\
17:08\
and the leaders of His Church.\
17:10\
I testify of Him and\
invoke His blessings\
17:15\
on all who seek to keep\
on His covenant path,\
17:19\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
