Eliza R. Snow, speaking of the\
Kirtland Temple dedication,\
0:06\
which she attended, said, "The\
ceremonies of that dedication\
0:12\
may be rehearsed, but\
no mortal language\
0:16\
can describe the\
heavenly manifestations\
0:19\
of that memorable day.\
0:21\
Angels appeared to some, while\
a sense of divine presence\
0:27\
was realized by all\
present, and each heart\
0:31\
was filled with joy\
inexpressible and full\
0:35\
of glory."\
0:36\
The divine manifestations that\
occurred in the Kirtland Temple\
0:40\
were foundational to the purpose\
of the restored Church of Jesus\
0:44\
Christ to bring to\
pass the salvation\
0:47\
and exaltation of our\
Heavenly Father's children.\
0:51\
As we prepare to\
meet God, we can\
0:55\
know what our divinely\
appointed responsibilities\
0:58\
are by reviewing the sacred\
keys restored in the Kirtland\
1:03\
Temple.\
1:04\
In the dedicatory prayer, the\
Prophet Joseph Smith humbly\
1:07\
petitioned the Lord "to\
accept of this house, ...\
1:11\
which thou didst\
command us to build."\
1:15\
One week later,\
on Easter Sunday,\
1:18\
the Lord appeared in\
a magnificent vision\
1:21\
and accepted His temple.\
1:23\
This occurred on April 3,\
1836, almost exactly 182 years\
1:30\
ago from this Easter Sunday.\
1:33\
It was also the Passover\
season--one of those rare times\
1:37\
when Easter and\
Passover overlap.\
1:41\
After the vision closed, three\
ancient prophets--Moses, Elias,\
1:46\
and Elijah--appeared and\
committed keys which were\
1:50\
essential to accomplish the\
Lord's purpose for His restored\
1:53\
Church in this dispensation.\
1:56\
That purpose has been simply\
but eloquently defined\
2:01\
as gathering Israel,\
sealing them as families,\
2:04\
and preparing the world for\
the Lord's second coming.\
2:07\
For both Elijah and Moses to\
appear was a "striking parallel\
2:11\
... [with] Jewish tradition,\
according to which Moses\
2:14\
and Elijah would arrive together\
at the 'end of time.'" In\
2:19\
our doctrine, this appearance\
accomplished the foundational\
2:22\
restoration of certain\
keys "given ...\
2:26\
for the last days and\
for the last time,\
2:28\
in the which is the dispensation\
of the fulness of times."\
2:33\
The Kirtland Temple, both\
in location and size,\
2:36\
was relatively obscure.\
2:38\
But in terms of its enormous\
significance to mankind,\
2:43\
it was eternity-shaping.\
2:45\
Ancient prophets\
restored priesthood keys\
2:49\
for the eternal\
saving ordinances\
2:51\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
2:54\
This resulted in overwhelming\
joy for faithful members.\
2:59\
These keys provide the "power\
from on high" for divinely\
3:04\
appointed responsibilities that\
constitute the primary purpose\
3:08\
of the Church.\
3:09\
On that wonderful Easter\
day in the Kirtland Temple,\
3:12\
three keys were restored.\
3:15\
First, Moses appeared\
and committed\
3:18\
the keys of the\
gathering of Israel\
3:20\
from the four parts\
of the earth, which\
3:23\
is missionary work.\
3:25\
Second, Elias\
appeared and committed\
3:27\
the keys of the dispensation\
of the gospel of Abraham,\
3:30\
which includes the restoration\
of the Abrahamic covenant.\
3:34\
President Russell\
M. Nelson has taught\
3:36\
that the purpose of\
the covenant keys\
3:39\
is to prepare members\
for the kingdom of God.\
3:41\
He said, "We know who\
we are and [we know]\
3:44\
what God expects of us."\
3:47\
Third, Elijah\
appeared and committed\
3:49\
the keys of the sealing power\
in this dispensation, which\
3:54\
is family history\
work and temple\
3:56\
ordinances enabling salvation\
for the living and the dead.\
4:01\
There are, under the direction\
of the First Presidency\
4:04\
and Quorum of the Twelve,\
three executive councils\
4:08\
at Church headquarters\
that oversee\
4:10\
these divinely appointed\
responsibilities based\
4:14\
on the keys that were restored\
in the Kirtland Temple.\
4:17\
They are the Missionary\
Executive Council,\
4:20\
the Priesthood and\
Family Executive Council,\
4:22\
and the Temple and Family\
History Executive Council.\
4:26\
Where do we stand today in\
fulfilling these divinely\
4:30\
appointed responsibilities?\
4:32\
First, with respect\
to Moses's restoration\
4:36\
of the keys for the\
gathering of Israel,\
4:38\
today almost 70,000\
missionaries are\
4:41\
spread across the earth\
preaching His gospel\
4:44\
to gather His elect.\
4:46\
This is the commencement\
of the fulfillment\
4:49\
of the great and\
marvelous work Nephi\
4:51\
foresaw among both the Gentiles\
and the house of Israel.\
4:56\
Nephi saw our time,\
when the Saints of God\
5:00\
would be upon all\
the face of the earth\
5:02\
but their numbers would be\
small because of wickedness.\
5:06\
However, he foresaw\
that they would\
5:08\
be "armed with righteousness\
and with the power of God\
5:13\
in great glory."\
5:14\
When viewed across the brief\
history of the restored Church,\
5:18\
the missionary effort\
has been most remarkable.\
5:21\
We are seeing the fulfillment\
of Nephi's vision.\
5:25\
Though our numbers\
are relatively few,\
5:28\
we will continue our\
effort and outreach\
5:30\
to those who will respond\
to the Savior's message.\
5:34\
Second, Elias\
appeared and committed\
5:36\
the dispensation of\
the gospel of Abraham,\
5:38\
declaring that in us and\
our seed all generations\
5:43\
after us should be blessed.\
5:44\
In this conference,\
significant guidance\
5:48\
has been presented to assist\
in perfecting the Saints\
5:51\
and preparing them for\
the kingdom of God.\
5:54\
The announcement in\
the priesthood session\
5:56\
with respect to elders\
and high priests quorums\
6:00\
will unleash priesthood\
power and authority.\
6:04\
Home and visiting\
teaching, now "ministering"\
6:07\
as taught so eloquently\
in this session,\
6:10\
will prepare Latter-day\
Saints to meet God.\
6:15\
Third, Elijah committed\
the sealing keys\
6:17\
of this dispensation.\
6:19\
For those of us\
alive at this time,\
6:21\
the increase in temples\
and family history work\
6:24\
is phenomenal.\
6:26\
This pace will\
continue and accelerate\
6:29\
until the Second\
Coming of the Savior,\
6:32\
lest the whole earth "be\
utterly wasted at his coming."\
6:37\
Family history work,\
heaven-blessed by technology,\
6:40\
has dramatically increased\
in the past few years.\
6:43\
We would be unwise\
to become complacent\
6:46\
about this divinely\
appointed responsibility\
6:49\
and expect that Aunt Jane or\
some other committed relative\
6:54\
will take care of it.\
6:55\
Let me share President\
Joseph Fielding Smith's\
6:58\
jarring comments:\
"None is exempt\
7:02\
from this great obligation.\
7:04\
It is required of the apostle\
as well as the humblest elder\
7:08\
[or sister].\
7:09\
Place, or distinction, or\
long service in the Church ...\
7:13\
will not entitle one to\
disregard the salvation\
7:17\
of one's dead."\
7:19\
We now have temples across\
the world and the resources\
7:22\
of the patron assistance\
fund to help those in need\
7:25\
who are far from a temple.\
7:28\
As individuals, we would do\
well to evaluate our effort\
7:32\
in pursuing missionary, temple\
and family history work,\
7:35\
and preparing to meet God.\
7:38\
Righteousness, unity, and\
equality before the Lord\
7:42\
undergird these sacred\
responsibilities.\
7:45\
With respect to\
righteousness, this life\
7:49\
is the time for all of us\
to prepare to meet God.\
7:52\
The Book of Mormon\
provides multiple examples\
7:55\
of the tragic consequences\
when individuals or groups fail\
7:59\
to keep the commandments of God.\
8:02\
During my lifetime, worldly\
issues and concerns have moved\
8:06\
from one extreme to\
another--from frivolous\
8:09\
and trivial pursuits\
to serious immorality.\
8:12\
It is commendable that\
nonconsensual immorality\
8:16\
has been exposed and denounced.\
8:19\
Such nonconsensual immorality\
is against the laws of God\
8:23\
and of society.\
8:25\
Those who understand\
God's plan should also\
8:28\
oppose consensual immorality,\
which is also a sin.\
8:33\
The family proclamation to the\
world warns "that individuals\
8:39\
who violate covenants\
of chastity,\
8:41\
who abuse spouse or offspring\
[or, for that matter,\
8:46\
anyone else] ... will one day\
stand accountable before God."\
8:51\
As we look around, we see\
the devastation of wickedness\
8:54\
and addiction at every turn.\
8:57\
If as individuals we\
are really concerned\
9:00\
about the ultimate\
judgment of our Savior,\
9:02\
we should seek repentance.\
9:04\
I am afraid many people no\
longer feel accountable to God\
9:08\
and do not turn to the\
scriptures or the prophets\
9:11\
for guidance.\
9:12\
If we as a society would\
contemplate the consequences\
9:17\
of sin, there would be\
massive public opposition\
9:20\
to pornography and the\
objectification of women.\
9:24\
As Alma told his son Corianton\
in the Book of Mormon,\
9:27\
"Wickedness never\
was happiness."\
9:31\
In regards to unity, the Savior\
declared, "If ye are not one ye\
9:34\
are not mine."\
9:35\
We know that the spirit of\
contention is of the devil.\
9:39\
In our day the scriptural\
imperative for unity\
9:41\
is largely ignored,\
and for many people\
9:44\
the emphasis is on\
tribalism, often\
9:46\
based on status, gender,\
race, and wealth.\
9:49\
In many countries,\
if not most, people\
9:52\
are deeply divided\
about how to live.\
9:54\
In the Lord's Church, the only\
culture we adhere to and teach\
9:59\
is the culture of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
10:02\
The unity we seek\
is to be unified\
10:05\
with the Savior\
and His teachings.\
10:08\
As we look at the primary\
purposes of the Church,\
10:11\
they are based on\
equality before the Lord\
10:15\
and following the culture of\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
10:19\
With respect to missionary work,\
the principal qualifications\
10:23\
for baptism are humbling\
oneself before God\
10:28\
and coming forth with a broken\
heart and contrite spirit.\
10:32\
Education, wealth,\
race, or national origin\
10:35\
are not even considered.\
10:38\
In addition, missionaries\
humbly serve where called.\
10:41\
They do not attempt\
to serve based\
10:43\
on worldly standards of\
status or preparation\
10:47\
for future careers.\
10:48\
They serve with all their\
heart, might, mind, and strength\
10:53\
wherever they are assigned.\
10:55\
They do not choose their\
missionary companions,\
10:58\
and they seek diligently to\
develop Christlike attributes,\
11:02\
which is at the heart of\
the culture of Jesus Christ.\
11:06\
The scriptures give guidance\
for our most important\
11:09\
relationships.\
11:09\
The Savior taught that\
the first commandment\
11:11\
was to "love the Lord thy God."\
11:13\
And the second is to "love\
thy neighbour as thyself."\
11:17\
The Savior\
subsequently explained\
11:19\
that everyone is our neighbor.\
11:21\
The Book of Mormon\
makes it clear\
11:23\
that there must be no\
-ites, tribes, or classes.\
11:26\
We must be united\
and equal before God.\
11:29\
Sacred ordinances and\
divine responsibilities\
11:33\
are built upon this premise.\
11:35\
I would expect that your own\
experiences in the temple\
11:38\
would be similar to mine.\
11:40\
When I would leave my workaday\
world in San Francisco\
11:44\
and arrive at the\
Oakland Temple,\
11:46\
I would experience an\
overwhelming feeling\
11:48\
of love and peace.\
11:50\
A major part of\
that was sensing I\
11:52\
was closer to God\
and His purposes.\
11:55\
The saving ordinances\
were my primary focus,\
11:58\
but a significant part of\
those beautiful feelings\
12:02\
was the equality and unity\
that permeate the temple.\
12:05\
Everyone is dressed\
in white clothing.\
12:08\
There is no evidence\
of wealth, rank,\
12:10\
or educational attainment; we\
are all brothers and sisters\
12:14\
humbling ourselves before God.\
12:17\
In the sacred sealing room\
the eternal marriage ordinance\
12:20\
is the same for everyone.\
12:23\
I love the fact that the couple\
from the humblest background\
12:28\
and the couple from the\
wealthiest background\
12:31\
have exactly the\
same experience.\
12:33\
They wear the same type of robes\
and make the same covenants\
12:37\
across the same altar.\
12:38\
They also receive the same\
eternal priesthood blessings.\
12:42\
This is accomplished in\
a beautiful temple built\
12:44\
by the tithes of the Saints as\
the sacred house of the Lord.\
12:49\
Fulfilling divinely\
appointed responsibilities,\
12:52\
based on righteousness, unity,\
and equality before the Lord,\
12:55\
brings personal happiness\
and peace in this world\
12:58\
and prepares us for eternal\
life in the world to come.\
13:02\
It prepares us to meet God.\
13:05\
We pray that each\
of you, regardless\
13:07\
of your current circumstances,\
will counsel with your bishop\
13:10\
and be worthy of a\
temple recommend.\
13:13\
We are grateful that\
many more members are\
13:15\
preparing to go to the temple.\
13:17\
There has been a\
significant increase\
13:19\
in the number of worthy adult\
temple recommend holders\
13:22\
for many years.\
13:24\
Limited-use recommends\
for worthy youth\
13:27\
have increased dramatically\
over the last two years.\
13:31\
Clearly, the faithful core\
membership of the Church\
13:35\
has never been stronger.\
13:37\
In conclusion, please be assured\
that senior Church leaders who\
13:41\
preside over the\
divinely appointed\
13:44\
purposes of the Church\
receive divine assistance.\
13:48\
This guidance comes\
from the Spirit\
13:50\
and sometimes directly\
from the Savior.\
13:53\
Both kinds of spiritual\
guidance are given.\
13:55\
I am grateful to have\
received such assistance.\
13:59\
But guidance is given\
in the Lord's time, line\
14:02\
upon line and\
precept upon precept,\
14:05\
when "an omniscient\
Lord deliberately\
14:08\
chooses to school us."\
14:10\
Guidance for the whole Church\
comes only to His prophet.\
14:16\
We have all had the privilege of\
sustaining President Russell M.\
14:19\
Nelson as our\
prophet and President\
14:21\
of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day\
14:23\
Saints in this conference.\
14:25\
The Twelve, as a group\
and individually,\
14:27\
had a significant\
spiritual experience\
14:30\
when we laid our hands\
on President Nelson's\
14:32\
head and President\
Dallin H. Oaks,\
14:35\
acting as voice, ordained\
him and set him apart\
14:39\
as President of the Church.\
14:40\
I testify that he\
was foreordained\
14:44\
and has been prepared\
his entire life\
14:47\
to be the Lord's\
prophet for our day.\
14:50\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
