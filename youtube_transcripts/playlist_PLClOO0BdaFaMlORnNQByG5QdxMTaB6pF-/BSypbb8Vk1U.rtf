To paraphrase Ralph\
Waldo Emerson, "The most\
0:05\
memorable moments in life\
are those in which we\
0:08\
feel the rush of revelation."\
0:10\
President Nelson, I don't\
know how many more "rushes"\
0:14\
we can handle this weekend.\
0:15\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:23\
Some of us have weak hearts.\
0:26\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:28\
But as I think about it, you\
can take care of that, too.\
0:32\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:38\
What a prophet!\
0:43\
In the spirit of President\
Nelson's marvelous declarations\
0:46\
and testimonies last\
night and this morning,\
0:50\
I bear my own witness\
that these adjustments\
0:54\
are examples of the\
revelation that has guided\
0:57\
this Church from its beginning.\
0:59\
They are yet more\
evidence that the Lord is\
1:03\
hastening His work in its time.\
1:07\
For all who are eager to learn\
the details of these matters,\
1:11\
please know that immediately\
upon the conclusion\
1:15\
of this session of\
conference, a sequence\
1:19\
will begin that includes, not\
necessarily in this order,\
1:23\
sending a letter from\
the First Presidency\
1:26\
to every member of\
the Church for whom\
1:28\
we have an email address.\
1:29\
A seven-page document\
of questions and answers\
1:35\
will be attached for all\
priesthood and auxiliary\
1:38\
leaders.\
1:39\
Lastly, those materials are\
being posted immediately\
1:44\
on ministering.lds.org.\
1:48\
"Ask, and it shall be given\
you; seek, and ye shall find."\
1:55\
[LAUGHTER]\
1:55\
Now to the wonderful\
assignment President Nelson\
1:58\
has given to me and\
to Sister Bingham.\
2:02\
Brothers and sisters, as the\
work of quorums and auxiliaries\
2:07\
matures institutionally, it\
follows that we should mature\
2:12\
personally as well--individually\
rising above any mechanical,\
2:20\
function-without-feeling routine\
to the heartfelt discipleship\
2:26\
articulated by the Savior at\
the conclusion of His earthly\
2:30\
ministry.\
2:31\
As He prepared to leave\
His still-innocent and\
2:36\
somewhat-confused little\
band of followers,\
2:39\
He did not list a dozen\
administrative steps\
2:44\
they had to take or hand\
them a fistful of reports\
2:48\
to be filled out in triplicate.\
2:50\
No, He summarized their task\
in one fundamental commandment:\
2:58\
"Love one another; as\
I have loved you. ...\
3:04\
By this shall all\
men know that [you]\
3:10\
are my disciples, if [you]\
have love one to another."\
3:17\
Now, in an effort to move us\
closer to that gospel ideal,\
3:21\
this newly announced\
priesthood and Relief Society\
3:25\
ministering concept\
will include,\
3:27\
among other things,\
some of the following\
3:30\
elements, many of which the\
Relief Society has already\
3:35\
put in place with\
wonderful success.\
3:39\
We will no longer use\
home teaching and visiting\
3:43\
teaching language.\
3:44\
That is partly because much\
of our ministering effort\
3:48\
will be in settings\
other than the home\
3:50\
and partly because our contact\
won't be defined by teaching\
3:56\
a prepared lesson, though a\
lesson certainly may be shared\
4:01\
if there is need for such.\
4:03\
The primary purpose in this\
ministering idea will be,\
4:08\
as was said of the\
people in Alma's day,\
4:11\
to "watch over [the]\
people, and ...\
4:14\
nourish them with things\
pertaining to righteousness."\
4:20\
We will continue to\
visit homes as possible,\
4:23\
but local circumstances such as\
large numbers, long distances,\
4:28\
personal safety, other\
challenging conditions--this\
4:31\
may preclude a visit to\
every home every month.\
4:35\
As the First Presidency\
counseled years ago,\
4:38\
do the best you can.\
4:41\
In addition to whatever\
schedule you establish\
4:44\
for actual visits,\
that calendar can\
4:48\
be supplemented with telephone\
calls, written notes, texts,\
4:53\
emails, video\
chats, conversations\
4:57\
at Church meetings,\
shared service projects,\
5:00\
social activities, a\
host of possibilities\
5:04\
in the world of social media.\
5:06\
However, I should stress that\
this expansive new view does\
5:13\
not include the sorry statement\
I recently saw on an automobile\
5:18\
bumper sticker.\
5:20\
It read, "If I honk,\
you've been home taught."\
5:25\
[LAUGHTER]\
5:32\
Please, please,\
brethren, the sisters\
5:35\
would never be guilty of that.\
5:38\
I speak to the brethren of the\
Church: with these adjustments\
5:43\
we want more care and\
concern, not less.\
5:47\
With this newer, more\
gospel-based concept\
5:50\
of ministering, I\
feel you starting\
5:53\
to panic about what\
counts on the report.\
5:56\
Well, relax, because there\
isn't any report--at least not\
6:02\
the 31st-of-the-month "I made\
it through the door by the skin\
6:05\
of my teeth" report.\
6:07\
Here too we are\
trying to mature.\
6:11\
The only report\
that will be made\
6:14\
is the number of\
interviews leaders\
6:16\
had with the ministering\
companionships in the ward\
6:20\
that quarter.\
6:21\
Simple as that\
sounds, my friends,\
6:24\
those interviews are\
absolutely crucial.\
6:28\
Without that\
information the bishop\
6:31\
will have no way to receive the\
information he needs regarding\
6:36\
the spiritual and temporal\
conditions of his people.\
6:40\
Remember: ministering\
brethren represent\
6:45\
the bishopric and elders\
quorum presidency;\
6:48\
they do not replace them.\
6:51\
The keys of a bishop\
and a quorum president\
6:55\
go far beyond this\
ministering concept.\
7:00\
Because this report is\
different from anything\
7:02\
you have submitted\
in the past, let\
7:04\
me stress that we at\
the Church headquarters\
7:08\
don't need to know how or\
where or when you make contact\
7:13\
with your people.\
7:14\
We just need to know and care\
very much that you do make it\
7:18\
and that you bless them\
in every way you can.\
7:23\
Brothers and sisters, we have\
a heaven-sent opportunity\
7:29\
as an entire Church to\
demonstrate pure religion\
7:35\
undefiled before God--to bear\
one another's burdens that they\
7:40\
may be light and to comfort\
those that stand in need\
7:43\
of comfort, to minister to\
the widows and the fatherless,\
7:48\
the married and the single,\
the strong and the distraught,\
7:53\
the downtrodden and the robust,\
the happy and the sad--in\
7:58\
short, all of us,\
every one of us,\
8:02\
because we all need to feel\
the warm hand of friendship\
8:06\
and hear the firm\
declaration of faith.\
8:09\
However, I warn you, a new name,\
new flexibility, fewer reports\
8:17\
will not make one ounce of\
difference in our service\
8:22\
unless we see this\
as an invitation\
8:26\
to care for one another in\
a bold, new, holier way,\
8:31\
as President Nelson\
has just said.\
8:35\
As we lift our spiritual eyes\
toward living the law of love\
8:39\
more universally, we pay\
tribute to the generations who\
8:44\
have served that way for years.\
8:46\
Let me note a recent example\
of such devotion in hopes\
8:50\
that legions more will\
grasp the Lord's commandment\
8:54\
to "be with and strengthen"\
our brothers and sisters.\
9:01\
Last January 14, a\
Sunday, just a little\
9:05\
after 5:00 p.m., my young\
friends Brett and Kristin\
9:09\
Hamblin were chatting at\
their home in Tempe, Arizona,\
9:14\
after Brett's day serving in\
the bishopric and Kristin's\
9:18\
busy day caring\
for five children.\
9:21\
Suddenly Kristin, a\
seemingly successful survivor\
9:25\
of breast cancer the previous\
year, fell unresponsive.\
9:31\
A call to 911 brought\
an emergency team trying\
9:35\
desperately to revive her.\
9:37\
As Brett prayed and\
pleaded, he quickly\
9:41\
placed just two other\
telephone calls:\
9:45\
one to his mother\
requesting her help\
9:47\
with the children, the other to\
Edwin Potter, his home teacher.\
9:53\
The latter conversation in\
its entirety went as follows:\
9:59\
Edwin, noting caller ID,\
said, "Hey, Brett, what's up?"\
10:05\
Brett's near-shouted response\
was: "I need you here--now!"\
10:13\
In fewer minutes than\
Brett could count,\
10:16\
his priesthood colleague\
was standing at his side,\
10:20\
helping with the\
children and then driving\
10:23\
Brother Hamblin to the hospital\
behind the ambulance carrying\
10:27\
his wife.\
10:28\
There, less than 40\
minutes after she had first\
10:33\
closed her eyes, the physicians\
pronounced Kristin dead.\
10:39\
As Brett sobbed, Edwin simply\
held him in his arms and cried\
10:49\
with him--for a long, long time.\
10:55\
Then, leaving Brett to grieve\
with other family members who'd\
10:58\
gathered, Edwin drove\
to the bishop's home\
11:02\
to tell him what\
had just transpired.\
11:05\
A marvelous bishop started\
immediately for the hospital\
11:10\
while Edwin drove on to\
the Hamblin household.\
11:14\
There he and his\
wife, Charlotte,\
11:16\
who had also come\
running, played\
11:20\
with the five now-motherless\
Hamblin children,\
11:23\
ages 12 down to 3.\
11:26\
They fed them an\
evening meal, held\
11:30\
an impromptu musical\
recital, and helped\
11:34\
them get ready for bed.\
11:37\
Brett told me later, "The\
amazing part of this story\
11:42\
isn't that Edwin\
came when I called.\
11:44\
In an emergency, there are\
always people willing to help.\
11:48\
No, the amazing\
part of the story\
11:52\
is that he was the\
one I thought of.\
11:54\
There were other people around.\
11:56\
Kristin has a\
brother and a sister\
11:58\
less than three miles away.\
12:00\
We have a great\
bishop, the greatest.\
12:03\
But the relationship\
between Edwin and me\
12:06\
is such that I\
felt instinctively\
12:10\
to call him when I needed help.\
12:13\
The Church provides\
us," Brett said,\
12:17\
"a structured way to live the\
second commandment better--to\
12:22\
love, serve, and develop\
relationships with our brothers\
12:27\
and sisters that help\
us move closer to God."\
12:34\
Edwin said about the\
experience, "Elder Holland,\
12:39\
the irony in all of\
this is that Brett\
12:42\
has been our family's\
home teacher for longer\
12:45\
than I have been theirs.\
12:47\
Over that time, he has visited\
us more as a friend than\
12:52\
by any assignment.\
12:54\
He has been a great\
example, the epitome\
12:58\
of what an active and involved\
priesthood bearer should be.\
13:02\
My wife, our boys,\
we don't see him\
13:06\
as one obligated to bring\
us a message at the end\
13:09\
of the month; we think of him\
as a friend who just lives down\
13:14\
the street and around the\
corner, who would do anything\
13:17\
in this world to bless us.\
13:20\
I am so grateful I could\
repay just a little bit\
13:26\
of the debt I owe him."\
13:31\
Brothers and sisters,\
I join with you\
13:34\
in saluting every block teacher\
and ward teacher and home\
13:40\
teacher and visiting\
teacher who has loved\
13:44\
and served so faithfully\
throughout our history.\
13:48\
Our prayer today is that every\
man and woman--and our older\
13:54\
young men and young women--will\
leave this general conference\
13:59\
more deeply committed to\
heartfelt care for one another,\
14:03\
motivated only by the pure\
love of Christ to do so.\
14:10\
In spite of what we all\
feel are our limitations\
14:15\
and our inadequacies--and we all\
have challenges--nevertheless,\
14:21\
may we labor side by side\
with the Lord of the vineyard,\
14:33\
giving the God and Father of\
us all a helping hand with His\
14:40\
staggering task of answering\
prayers, providing comfort,\
14:47\
drying tears, and\
strengthening feeble knees.\
14:52\
If we will do that,\
we will be more\
14:57\
like the true disciples of\
Christ we are meant to be.\
15:03\
On this Easter Sunday,\
may we love one another\
15:08\
as He has loved us, I\
pray in the sacred name\
15:14\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
