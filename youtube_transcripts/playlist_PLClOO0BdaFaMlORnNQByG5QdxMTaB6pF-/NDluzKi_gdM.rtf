A year ago, in the\
general priesthood session\
0:03\
of conference,\
Bishop Gerald Causse\
0:06\
spoke to the men of\
the Church, describing\
0:09\
how Aaronic and\
Melchizedek Priesthood\
0:11\
holders are inseparable\
partners in accomplishing\
0:14\
the work of salvation.\
0:16\
That message has\
been a great blessing\
0:19\
in helping the young men who\
hold the Aaronic Priesthood see\
0:22\
the part they play in\
building the kingdom of God\
0:25\
on this earth.\
0:26\
Their joint service\
strengthens the Church\
0:29\
and brings about deeper\
conversion and commitment\
0:32\
in the hearts of our\
young men as they\
0:35\
see the value of\
their contribution\
0:37\
and how magnificent\
this work is.\
0:40\
Today I would like\
for my remarks\
0:42\
to be a bookend to\
that message as I\
0:45\
talk about the young\
women of the Church, who\
0:48\
are equally needed and\
essential in accomplishing\
0:51\
the work of the Lord in their\
families and in the Church.\
0:55\
Like Bishop Causse, I lived in\
a small branch of the Church\
0:58\
during a good part\
of my teen years,\
1:00\
and I was often asked to fulfill\
assignments and callings that\
1:04\
normally would have\
been done by adults.\
1:06\
For example, those of\
us in the youth program\
1:09\
often took the lead in\
helping organize and run\
1:12\
our activities and\
special events.\
1:14\
We wrote plays, formed a\
singing group to entertain\
1:17\
at branch activities, and\
were full participants\
1:19\
in every meeting.\
1:21\
I was called to be the\
branch music leader\
1:23\
and led the singing in\
sacrament meeting each week.\
1:26\
It was a great experience\
as a 16-year-old\
1:30\
to stand in front of\
everyone in the branch each\
1:32\
Sunday and lead them\
in singing the hymns.\
1:34\
I felt needed and knew I\
had something to contribute.\
1:38\
People depended\
on me to be there,\
1:40\
and I loved feeling useful.\
1:43\
That experience helped build\
my testimony of Jesus Christ,\
1:47\
and just as it did\
for Bishop Causse,\
1:49\
it anchored my life\
in gospel service.\
1:53\
Each member should know how\
much he or she is needed.\
1:57\
Each person has something\
important to contribute\
2:01\
and has unique\
talents and abilities\
2:03\
that help move this\
important work along.\
2:06\
Our young men have\
Aaronic Priesthood duties\
2:08\
described in the\
Doctrine and Covenants\
2:10\
that are rather visible.\
2:12\
It may be less obvious\
to the young women\
2:15\
of the Church, their\
parents, and their leaders\
2:17\
that from the time\
they are baptized,\
2:20\
young women have covenant\
responsibilities "to mourn\
2:24\
with those that mourn;\
yea, and comfort\
2:26\
those that stand\
in need of comfort,\
2:28\
and to stand as witnesses of God\
at all times and in all things,\
2:33\
and in all places that [they]\
may be in, even until death."\
2:37\
Young women have\
opportunities to fulfill\
2:39\
these responsibilities in\
their wards and branches\
2:42\
and when they serve\
in class presidencies,\
2:45\
on youth councils,\
and in other callings.\
2:48\
Every young woman in the\
Church should feel valued,\
2:52\
have opportunities\
to serve, and feel\
2:55\
that she has something of worth\
to contribute to this work.\
2:58\
In Handbook 2, we learn\
that the work of salvation\
3:01\
within our wards includes\
"member missionary work,\
3:05\
convert retention, activation\
of less-active members, temple\
3:10\
and family history work,\
and teaching the gospel."\
3:13\
This work is directed by our\
faithful bishops, who hold\
3:16\
priesthood keys for their ward.\
3:18\
For many years\
now our presidency\
3:20\
has been asking the question,\
"Which of these areas\
3:23\
mentioned should our young\
women not be involved in?"\
3:27\
The answer is that they\
have something to contribute\
3:30\
in all areas of this work.\
3:33\
For example, I recently\
met several young women\
3:35\
in the Las Vegas\
area who have been\
3:37\
called to serve as ward temple\
and family history consultants.\
3:41\
They were glowing\
with enthusiasm\
3:44\
about being able to teach and\
help members of their ward\
3:47\
find their ancestors.\
3:48\
They had valuable\
skills on the computer,\
3:51\
had learned how to\
use FamilySearch,\
3:53\
and were excited to share\
that knowledge with others.\
3:56\
It was clear that\
they had testimonies\
3:59\
and an understanding of the\
importance of seeking out\
4:02\
the names of our\
deceased ancestors\
4:04\
so that essential saving\
ordinances can be performed\
4:08\
for them in the temple.\
4:10\
Several months ago,\
I had the opportunity\
4:13\
to test an idea with two\
14-year-old young women.\
4:16\
I obtained copies of two\
actual ward council agendas\
4:21\
and gave Emma and\
Maggie each a copy.\
4:23\
I asked them to read\
over the agendas\
4:26\
and see if there were any action\
items from the ward councils\
4:29\
in which they might be\
able to be of service.\
4:32\
Emma saw that a new family\
was moving into the ward,\
4:35\
and she said she thought\
she could help them move in\
4:38\
and unpack.\
4:39\
She thought she could befriend\
the children in the family\
4:41\
and show them around\
their new school.\
4:43\
She saw there was a\
ward dinner coming up\
4:46\
and felt there were\
many different ways she\
4:47\
could offer her services there.\
4:50\
Maggie saw that there were\
several elderly people\
4:52\
in the ward who needed\
visits and fellowshipping.\
4:55\
She said she would love\
to visit with and be\
4:57\
of help to these\
wonderful older members.\
4:59\
She also felt she could help\
teach members of the ward\
5:02\
how to set up and use\
social media accounts.\
5:05\
There really wasn't one\
thing on those agendas\
5:08\
with which those two young\
women could not help!\
5:12\
Do those who sit\
on ward councils,\
5:14\
or hold any calling in the\
ward, see the young women\
5:17\
as valuable resources to\
help fill the many needs\
5:20\
within our wards?\
5:21\
There is usually a long list of\
situations that require someone\
5:25\
to serve, and we often only\
think of the adults in the ward\
5:28\
to meet those needs.\
5:30\
Just as our Aaronic\
Priesthood holders\
5:33\
have been invited to\
labor with their fathers\
5:35\
and other men of the\
Melchizedek Priesthood,\
5:38\
our young women can be called\
upon to provide service\
5:41\
and minister to the needs of\
ward members with their mothers\
5:44\
or other exemplary sisters.\
5:46\
They are capable, eager, and\
willing to do so much more\
5:50\
than merely attend\
church on Sundays!\
5:53\
As we consider the roles\
that our young women will\
5:56\
be expected to assume\
in the near future,\
5:58\
we might ask ourselves\
what kind of experiences\
6:01\
we could provide for\
them now that will\
6:04\
help with their preparation\
to be missionaries, gospel\
6:07\
scholars, leaders in\
the Church auxiliaries,\
6:09\
temple workers, wives, mothers,\
mentors, examples, and friends.\
6:15\
They can actually begin now\
to fill many of those roles.\
6:19\
Youth are often asked\
to help teach lessons\
6:22\
on Sunday in their classes.\
6:24\
Opportunities are now\
available for our young women\
6:27\
to perform service in the\
temple previously completed\
6:30\
by ordinance workers\
or volunteers\
6:32\
when they attend with\
their youth groups\
6:34\
to perform baptisms\
for the dead.\
6:36\
Our Primary-age\
girls are now invited\
6:38\
to attend Temple and Priesthood\
Preparation meetings, which\
6:42\
will help them\
understand that they too\
6:45\
are important participants\
in priesthood-directed work.\
6:48\
They are learning that men,\
women, youth, and children are\
6:52\
all recipients of\
priesthood blessings,\
6:54\
and all can take an active\
role in moving forward\
6:57\
the Lord's work.\
6:59\
Bishops, we know your\
duties are often heavy,\
7:02\
but just as one of\
your highest priorities\
7:04\
is to preside over the\
Aaronic Priesthood quorums,\
7:07\
Handbook 2 explains that "the\
bishop and his counselors\
7:12\
provide priesthood leadership\
for the Young Women\
7:14\
organization.\
7:15\
They watch over and strengthen\
individual young women,\
7:19\
working closely with\
parents and Young Women\
7:22\
leaders in this effort."\
7:23\
It also states that "the\
bishop and his counselors\
7:27\
regularly participate in\
Young Women meetings, service,\
7:30\
and activities."\
7:32\
We are grateful for bishops who\
take the time to visit Young\
7:36\
Women classes and who provide\
opportunities for young women\
7:39\
to be more than mere\
spectators of the work.\
7:42\
Thank you for making\
sure your young women are\
7:44\
valued participants in meeting\
the needs of ward members!\
7:48\
These opportunities to\
serve in meaningful ways\
7:51\
bless them much more than\
activities in which they\
7:54\
are just entertained.\
7:57\
To you, the young women of\
the Church, your teenage years\
8:01\
can be busy and\
often challenging.\
8:03\
We have noticed that\
many more of you\
8:05\
are struggling with issues\
of self-worth, anxiety,\
8:08\
high levels of stress, and\
perhaps even depression.\
8:11\
Turning your thoughts\
outward, instead of\
8:14\
dwelling on your own\
problems, may not\
8:16\
resolve all of these issues,\
but service can often\
8:20\
lighten your burdens and make\
your challenges seem less hard.\
8:23\
One of the best ways to\
increase feelings of self-worth\
8:27\
is to show, through our\
concern and service to others,\
8:30\
that we have much of\
worth to contribute.\
8:34\
I encourage you young women to\
raise your hands to volunteer\
8:38\
and to put those hands to work\
when you see needs around you.\
8:42\
As you fulfill your\
covenant responsibilities\
8:45\
and participate in building\
the kingdom of God,\
8:48\
blessings will\
flow into your life\
8:50\
and you'll discover the deep\
and lasting joy of discipleship.\
8:55\
Brothers and sisters, our\
young women are amazing.\
8:59\
They have talents, unlimited\
enthusiasm, and energy,\
9:03\
and they are\
compassionate and caring.\
9:05\
They want to be of service.\
9:08\
They need to know they\
are valued and essential\
9:10\
in the work of salvation.\
9:12\
Just as young men prepare in the\
Aaronic Priesthood for greater\
9:16\
service as they advance into\
the Melchizedek Priesthood,\
9:19\
our young women are preparing to\
become members of the greatest\
9:23\
women's organization on the\
earth--the Relief Society.\
9:26\
Together, these beautiful,\
strong, faithful young women\
9:30\
and young men are preparing\
to be wives and husbands\
9:34\
and mothers and\
fathers who will raise\
9:36\
families worthy of the\
celestial kingdom of God.\
9:39\
I testify that the work\
of our Heavenly Father\
9:42\
is to bring about the\
immortality and eternal life\
9:45\
of His children.\
9:46\
Our precious young women\
have an important role\
9:49\
to play in helping to\
accomplish this great work.\
9:53\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
