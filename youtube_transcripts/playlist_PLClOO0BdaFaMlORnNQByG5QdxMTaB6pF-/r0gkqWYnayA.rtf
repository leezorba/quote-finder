My dear wife, Julie, and I have\
raised six precious children,\
0:05\
and we recently\
became empty nesters.\
0:08\
How I miss having our\
children in our home\
0:11\
on a full-time basis.\
0:12\
I miss learning from\
them and teaching them.\
0:16\
Today I direct my remarks\
to all parents and all\
0:18\
who desire to be parents.\
0:20\
Many of you are\
raising children now.\
0:23\
For others, that\
time might come soon.\
0:24\
And for still others, parenthood\
may be a future blessing.\
0:28\
I pray we all recognize\
the joyful and sacred\
0:31\
responsibility it\
is to teach a child.\
0:34\
As parents, we\
introduce our children\
0:36\
to Heavenly Father and\
His Son, Jesus Christ.\
0:38\
We help our children\
say their first prayer.\
0:41\
We offer guidance and support\
as they enter the covenant path\
0:43\
through baptism.\
0:45\
We teach them to obey\
God's commandments.\
0:47\
We educate them about His\
plan for His children,\
0:50\
and we help them recognize the\
whisperings of the Holy Ghost.\
0:54\
We tell them stories\
of ancient prophets\
0:56\
and encourage them to\
follow living ones.\
0:59\
We pray for their triumphs\
and ache with them\
1:01\
during their trials.\
1:03\
We testify to our children\
of temple blessings,\
1:06\
and we strive to\
prepare them well\
1:07\
to serve full-time missions.\
1:09\
We offer loving counsel as\
our children become parents\
1:11\
themselves.\
1:12\
But--even then--we never\
stop being their parents.\
1:16\
We never stop being\
their teachers.\
1:18\
We are never released from\
these eternal callings.\
1:22\
Today let's contemplate a few of\
the wonderful opportunities we\
1:25\
have to teach our\
children in our homes.\
1:27\
Let's begin with\
family home evening,\
1:29\
which was a high priority in\
the faith-filled home where\
1:31\
I was raised.\
1:33\
I don't remember specific\
lessons taught at family home\
1:36\
evening, but I do remember\
that we never missed a week.\
1:38\
I knew what was\
important to my parents.\
1:42\
I recall one of my favorite\
family home evening activities.\
1:45\
Dad would invite one of his\
children to take "The Test."\
1:48\
He would give the child\
a series of instructions\
1:50\
like, "First, go\
into the kitchen\
1:52\
and open and close the fridge.\
1:53\
Then run into my bedroom\
and grab a pair of socks\
1:56\
from my dresser.\
1:57\
Then come back to me, jump up\
and down three times, and say,\
2:00\
'Dad, I did it!'"\
2:04\
I loved it when it was my turn.\
2:06\
I wanted to get every\
step just right,\
2:08\
and I cherished the moment when\
I could say, "Dad, I did it!"\
2:12\
This activity helped\
build my confidence\
2:14\
and made it easier\
for a restless boy\
2:16\
to pay attention when Mom or\
Dad taught a gospel principle.\
2:20\
President Gordon B.\
Hinckley counseled:\
2:22\
"If you have any doubt about the\
virtue of family home evening,\
2:24\
try it.\
2:25\
Gather your children\
about you, teach them,\
2:28\
bear testimony to them,\
read the scriptures together\
2:31\
and have a good time together."\
2:33\
There will always be opposition\
to holding family home evening.\
2:37\
Regardless, I invite you to\
find a way around the obstacles\
2:40\
and make family home evening\
a priority--and make fun a key\
2:44\
ingredient.\
2:46\
Family prayer is another\
prime opportunity to teach.\
2:49\
I love how President N. Eldon\
Tanner's father taught him\
2:52\
during family prayer.\
2:53\
President Tanner said this:\
2:56\
"I remember one evening when we\
were kneeling in family prayer,\
2:58\
my father said to the Lord,\
'Eldon did something today he\
3:02\
shouldn't have done; he's sorry,\
and if you will forgive him,\
3:05\
he won't do it anymore.'\
3:09\
"That made me determined not to\
do it anymore--much more than\
3:13\
a trouncing would have done."\
3:17\
As a boy, I would sometimes get\
irritated with our seemingly\
3:20\
excessive family prayers,\
thinking to myself, "Didn't we\
3:23\
just pray a few minutes ago?"\
3:25\
Now, as a parent, I\
know we can't ever\
3:29\
pray too much as a family.\
3:32\
I've always been\
impressed with how\
3:33\
Heavenly Father introduces\
Jesus Christ as His Beloved Son.\
3:37\
I enjoy praying for\
my children by name\
3:39\
as they listen to me express\
to Heavenly Father how\
3:42\
beloved they are to me.\
3:44\
It seems there is no better\
time to communicate love\
3:47\
to our children than\
when praying with them\
3:49\
or blessing them.\
3:50\
When families gather\
in humble prayer,\
3:52\
powerful and lasting\
lessons are taught.\
3:56\
Parental teaching is like\
being an on-call physician.\
3:58\
We always need to be ready to\
teach our children because we\
4:01\
never know when the opportunity\
will present itself.\
4:04\
We are like the Savior, whose\
teaching often "did not happen\
4:06\
in a synagogue but in informal,\
everyday settings--while eating\
4:11\
a meal with His disciples,\
drawing water from a well,\
4:14\
or walking past a fig tree."\
4:17\
Years ago, my mother shared\
that her two best gospel\
4:19\
conversations with my\
older brother, Matt,\
4:21\
were once while she was folding\
laundry and another time\
4:24\
while driving him\
to the dentist.\
4:26\
One of the many things I\
admired about my mother\
4:29\
was her readiness to\
teach her children.\
4:32\
Her parental\
teaching never ended.\
4:34\
While I was serving as a bishop,\
my mom, then 78 years old,\
4:37\
told me I needed\
to get a haircut.\
4:39\
She knew I needed\
to be an example,\
4:41\
and she didn't\
hesitate to tell me so.\
4:44\
I love you, Mom!\
4:47\
As a father, I am\
motivated personally\
4:50\
to study and ponder\
the scriptures in order\
4:52\
to be able to respond\
when my children\
4:54\
or grandchildren present an\
on-call teaching opportunity.\
4:57\
"Some of the best\
teaching moments\
4:59\
start as a question or concern\
in the heart of a [family]\
5:02\
member."\
5:02\
Are we listening\
during those moments?\
5:06\
I love the Apostle\
Peter's invitation:\
5:08\
"Be ready always\
to give an answer\
5:10\
to every man [and I add,\
child] that asketh you\
5:14\
a reason of the hope\
that is in you."\
5:17\
When I was a\
teenager, my dad and I\
5:20\
enjoyed challenging\
each other to see\
5:22\
who had the strongest grip.\
5:24\
We would squeeze\
the other's hand\
5:26\
as tightly as\
possible in an effort\
5:28\
to make the other\
grimace in pain.\
5:30\
It doesn't seem\
like much fun now,\
5:33\
but somehow it was at the time.\
5:35\
After one such battle,\
Dad looked me in the eyes\
5:38\
and said, "You have\
strong hands, son.\
5:42\
I hope your hands always have\
the strength to never touch\
5:45\
a young lady inappropriately."\
5:47\
He then invited me\
to stay morally clean\
5:49\
and help others do the same.\
5:52\
Elder Douglas L. Callister\
shared this about his father:\
5:55\
"While traveling home\
from work one day Father\
5:58\
spontaneously said, 'I\
paid my tithing today.\
6:01\
I wrote "thank you"\
on the tithing check.\
6:05\
I am so grateful to the Lord\
for blessing our family.'"\
6:10\
Elder Callister then paid this\
tribute to his father-teacher:\
6:13\
"He taught both acts and\
attitudes of obedience."\
6:18\
I think it wise to ask\
ourselves occasionally,\
6:20\
"What will I teach,\
or what am I teaching,\
6:22\
my children by my acts and\
attitudes of obedience?"\
6:27\
Family scripture study\
is an ideal forum\
6:29\
for teaching\
doctrine in the home.\
6:31\
President Russell M.\
Nelson said, "Not only\
6:34\
are parents to cling to\
the word of the Lord,\
6:36\
but they have a divine mandate\
to teach it to their children."\
6:41\
As Julie and I\
raised our children,\
6:42\
we tried to be\
consistent and creative.\
6:45\
One year we decided to\
read the Book of Mormon\
6:46\
in Spanish as a family.\
6:48\
Was that why the Lord\
called each of our children\
6:51\
who served a full-time mission\
to a Spanish-speaking mission?\
6:54\
Es posible.\
6:57\
I was deeply touched when\
Brother Brian K. Ashton shared\
7:02\
with me that he\
and his father read\
7:04\
every page of the Book of Mormon\
together during his senior year\
7:06\
of high school.\
7:07\
Brother Ashton loves\
the scriptures.\
7:09\
They are written in his\
mind and on his heart.\
7:12\
His father planted that\
seed when Brother Ashton was\
7:15\
a teenager, and that seed has\
grown into a deep-rooted tree\
7:18\
of truth.\
7:19\
Brother Ashton has done the\
same with his older children.\
7:22\
His eight-year-old son\
recently asked him,\
7:25\
"Dad, when do I get to read\
the Book of Mormon with you?"\
7:31\
Lastly, our most impactful\
parental teaching\
7:33\
is our example.\
7:34\
We are counseled to be "an\
example of the believers,\
7:37\
in word, in conversation, in\
charity, in spirit, in faith,\
7:40\
in purity."\
7:42\
During a recent\
trip, Julie and I\
7:44\
attended church and saw\
this verse in action.\
7:46\
A young man, soon to\
leave for his mission,\
7:48\
spoke in sacrament meeting.\
7:50\
He said, "You all think my dad\
is such a good man at church,\
7:53\
but ..."\
7:54\
He paused, and I\
anxiously wondered\
7:56\
what he might say next.\
7:57\
He continued and said,\
"He's a better man at home."\
8:02\
I thanked this\
young man afterward\
8:04\
for the inspiring tribute\
he had paid his father.\
8:06\
I then found out that his father\
was the bishop of the ward.\
8:10\
Even though this bishop was\
serving his ward faithfully,\
8:13\
his son felt that his best\
work was done at home.\
8:18\
Elder D. Todd\
Christofferson counsels:\
8:19\
"We have many avenues\
for teaching the ...\
8:21\
rising generation, and we\
should devote our best thinking\
8:24\
and effort to taking\
full advantage of them.\
8:26\
Above all, we must continue to\
encourage and help parents be\
8:29\
better and more\
consistent teachers ...\
8:31\
especially by example."\
8:36\
That's how the Savior teaches.\
8:39\
During a recent vacation with\
our two youngest children,\
8:41\
Julie suggested we do proxy\
baptisms in both the St. George\
8:44\
and San Diego Temples.\
8:46\
I murmured--to myself--thinking,\
"We attend the temple at home,\
8:51\
and now we're on vacation.\
8:52\
Why not do something\
more vacation-like?"\
8:55\
After the baptisms, Julie\
wanted to take pictures\
8:58\
outside the temple.\
9:00\
I silently murmured--again.\
9:02\
You can guess what happened\
next--we took pictures.\
9:08\
Julie wants our children\
to have memories\
9:10\
of how we helped our\
ancestors, and so do\
9:13\
I. We didn't need\
a formal lesson\
9:15\
on the importance of temples.\
9:17\
We were living it--thanks to\
a mother who loves the temple\
9:21\
and wants her children\
to share that love.\
9:24\
As parents cherish each other\
and offer righteous examples,\
9:27\
children are eternally blessed.\
9:29\
For all of you who are striving\
to do your best to teach\
9:31\
in your homes, may you find\
peace and joy in your efforts.\
9:34\
And if you feel you have\
room for improvement\
9:36\
or need greater preparation,\
please humbly respond\
9:39\
as the Spirit prompts you,\
and bind yourself to act.\
9:43\
Elder L. Tom Perry\
said, "The health\
9:46\
of any society, the happiness\
of its people, their prosperity,\
9:49\
and their peace all\
find common roots\
9:51\
in the teaching of\
children in the home."\
9:54\
Yes, my home nest is now\
empty, but I'm still on call,\
9:58\
ready and eager to find\
additional precious\
10:01\
opportunities to teach my\
grown children, their children,\
10:04\
and someday, I hope,\
their children.\
10:07\
I plead for heaven's\
help as we strive\
10:09\
to be Christlike\
teachers in our homes.\
10:11\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
