We are grateful to President\
Eyring and President Oaks\
0:04\
for their inspired messages, and\
to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir\
0:08\
for the beautiful\
music they have\
0:10\
provided this Easter morning.\
0:13\
It will now be my\
privilege to speak\
0:15\
to you, brothers and sisters.\
0:17\
Following my remarks, the\
choir will sing "He Is Risen."\
0:22\
The benediction will then\
be offered by Elder Joaquin\
0:25\
Costa of the Seventy.\
0:30\
What a glorious\
privilege it has been\
0:31\
to celebrate Easter\
with you on this Sunday\
0:35\
of general conference!\
0:36\
Nothing could be more\
fitting than to commemorate\
0:39\
the most important event that\
ever occurred on this earth\
0:43\
by worshipping the most\
important being who ever walked\
0:46\
this earth.\
0:48\
In this, The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints,\
0:52\
we worship Him who commenced\
His infinite Atonement\
0:56\
in the Garden of Gethsemane.\
0:58\
He was willing to suffer for\
the sins and weaknesses of each\
1:02\
of us, which suffering caused\
Him "to bleed at every pore."\
1:08\
He was crucified\
on Calvary's cross\
1:11\
and rose the third day as\
the first resurrected being\
1:14\
of our Heavenly\
Father's children.\
1:16\
I love Him and\
testify that He lives!\
1:20\
It is He who leads\
and guides His Church.\
1:27\
Without our Redeemer's infinite\
Atonement, not one of us\
1:30\
would have hope\
of ever returning\
1:33\
to our Heavenly Father.\
1:34\
Without His Resurrection,\
death would be the end.\
1:39\
Our Savior's Atonement\
made eternal life\
1:42\
a possibility and immortality\
a reality for all.\
1:49\
It is because of His\
transcendent mission\
1:52\
and the peace He grants His\
followers that my wife, Wendy,\
1:56\
and I felt comfort late\
on January 2, 2018,\
2:02\
when we were awakened by\
a phone call telling us\
2:07\
that President Thomas S. Monson\
had stepped through the veil.\
2:13\
How we miss President Monson!\
2:15\
We honor his life\
and his legacy.\
2:19\
A spiritual giant, he\
left an indelible imprint\
2:24\
upon all who knew him and\
upon the Church that he loved.\
2:30\
On Sunday, January 14, 2018, in\
the upper room of the Salt Lake\
2:35\
Temple, the First\
Presidency was reorganized\
2:38\
in the simple yet sacred\
pattern established by the Lord.\
2:44\
Then at yesterday\
morning's solemn assembly,\
2:47\
members of the Church\
throughout the world\
2:50\
raised their hands to\
confirm the earlier\
2:53\
action taken by the Apostles.\
2:56\
I am humbly grateful for\
your sustaining support.\
3:03\
I am also grateful for those\
upon whose shoulders I stand.\
3:08\
It has been my\
privilege to serve\
3:11\
in the Quorum of the Twelve\
Apostles for 34 years\
3:15\
and to know personally 10 of\
the 16 previous Presidents\
3:21\
of the Church.\
3:22\
I learned much\
from each of them.\
3:27\
I also owe much to my forebears.\
3:30\
All eight of my\
great-grandparents\
3:35\
were converts to the\
Church in Europe.\
3:40\
Each of these stalwart\
souls sacrificed everything\
3:45\
to come to Zion.\
3:50\
During subsequent generations,\
however, not all my ancestors\
3:54\
remained so committed.\
3:56\
As a result, I was not raised\
in a gospel-centered home.\
4:03\
I adored my parents.\
4:05\
They meant the world to me\
and taught me crucial lessons.\
4:08\
I cannot thank them enough\
for the happy home life they\
4:13\
created for me and my siblings.\
4:16\
And yet, even as a boy, I\
knew I was missing something.\
4:22\
One day I jumped\
on the streetcar\
4:25\
and went to an LDS bookstore to\
find a book about the Church.\
4:31\
I loved learning\
about the gospel.\
4:35\
As I came to understand\
the Word of Wisdom,\
4:37\
I wanted my parents\
to live that law.\
4:41\
So, one day when I was very\
young, I went to our basement\
4:48\
and smashed on the concrete\
floor every bottle of liquor!\
5:01\
I expected my father to punish\
me, but he never said a word.\
5:10\
As I matured and\
began to understand\
5:12\
the magnificence of\
Heavenly Father's plan,\
5:17\
I often said to myself, "I\
don't want one more Christmas\
5:22\
present!\
5:23\
I just want to be\
sealed to my parents."\
5:29\
That longed-for\
event did not happen\
5:32\
until my parents were past\
80, and then it did happen.\
5:40\
I cannot fully express\
the joy I felt that day.\
5:43\
And each day, I feel that joy\
of their sealing and my sealing\
5:50\
to them.\
5:53\
In 1945, while I was\
in medical school,\
5:57\
I married Dantzel White\
in the Salt Lake Temple.\
6:02\
She and I were blessed with\
nine splendid daughters and one\
6:09\
precious son.\
6:14\
El ultimo.\
6:19\
Today our ever-growing\
family is one of the greatest\
6:23\
joys of my life.\
6:26\
In 2005, after nearly\
60 years of marriage,\
6:31\
my dear Dantzel was\
unexpectedly called home.\
6:37\
For a season, my grief\
was almost immobilizing.\
6:43\
But the message of Easter and\
the promise of resurrection\
6:47\
sustained me.\
6:52\
Then the Lord brought\
Wendy Watson to my side.\
6:56\
We were sealed in the Salt\
Lake Temple on April 6, 2006.\
7:03\
How I love her!\
7:05\
She is an extraordinary\
woman--a great blessing to me,\
7:10\
to our family, and\
to the entire Church.\
7:15\
Each of these blessings\
has come as a result\
7:17\
of seeking and heeding the\
promptings of the Holy Ghost.\
7:23\
Said President Lorenzo Snow,\
"This is the grand privilege\
7:28\
of every Latter-day Saint ...\
that it is our right to have\
7:31\
the manifestations of the\
Spirit every day of our lives."\
7:39\
One of the things the\
Spirit has repeatedly\
7:42\
impressed upon my mind\
since my new calling\
7:45\
as President of the Church\
is how willing the Lord is\
7:49\
to reveal His mind and will.\
7:52\
The privilege of\
receiving revelation\
7:55\
is one of the greatest gifts\
of God to His children.\
8:00\
Through the manifestations\
of the Holy Ghost,\
8:02\
the Lord will assist us in\
all our righteous pursuits.\
8:09\
I remember in an operating\
room, I have stood over\
8:13\
a patient--unsure about how\
to perform an unprecedented\
8:17\
procedure--and experienced\
the Holy Ghost diagramming\
8:23\
the technique in my mind.\
8:28\
To strengthen my proposal\
to Wendy, I said to her,\
8:34\
"I know about revelation\
and how to receive it."\
8:37\
To her credit--and, as\
I have come to learn,\
8:43\
typical of her--she had already\
sought and received her own\
8:47\
revelation about us, which gave\
her the courage to say yes.\
8:58\
As a member of the Quorum\
of the Twelve Apostles,\
9:00\
I prayed daily for revelation\
and gave thanks to the Lord\
9:04\
every time He spoke\
to my heart and mind.\
9:09\
Imagine the miracle of it!\
9:11\
Whatever our Church calling, we\
can pray to our Heavenly Father\
9:16\
and receive guidance\
and direction,\
9:19\
be warned about dangers\
and distractions,\
9:23\
and be enabled to\
accomplish things we simply\
9:26\
could not do on our own.\
9:29\
If we will truly\
receive the Holy Ghost\
9:32\
and learn to discern and\
understand His promptings,\
9:35\
we will be guided in\
matters large and small.\
9:43\
When I recently faced\
the daunting task\
9:46\
of choosing two\
counselors, I wondered\
9:49\
how I could possibly choose just\
two from twelve men whom I love\
9:55\
and respect.\
9:58\
Because I know that\
good inspiration is\
10:00\
based upon good information,\
I prayerfully met one-on-one\
10:04\
with each Apostle.\
10:06\
I then sequestered myself in\
a private room in the temple\
10:10\
and sought the Lord's will.\
10:13\
I testify that the\
Lord instructed\
10:16\
me to select President Dallin\
H. Oaks and President Henry B.\
10:22\
Eyring to serve as my counselors\
in the First Presidency.\
10:27\
In like manner, I testify\
that the Lord inspired\
10:30\
the call of Elder Gerrit W.\
Gong and Elder Ulisses Soares\
10:35\
to be ordained as His Apostles.\
10:39\
I and we welcome them to this\
unique brotherhood of service.\
10:47\
When we convene as a Council\
of the First Presidency\
10:50\
and Quorum of the\
Twelve, our meeting rooms\
10:54\
become rooms of revelation.\
10:57\
The Spirit is palpably present.\
11:01\
As we wrestle with\
complex matters,\
11:04\
a thrilling process unfolds as\
each Apostle freely expresses\
11:10\
his thoughts and point of view.\
11:13\
Though we may differ in\
our initial perspectives,\
11:17\
the love we feel for\
each other is constant.\
11:21\
Our unity helps us to discern\
the Lord's will for His Church.\
11:30\
In our meetings, the\
majority never rules!\
11:33\
We listen prayerfully\
to one another\
11:36\
and talk with each other\
until we are united.\
11:40\
Then when we have\
reached complete accord,\
11:43\
the unifying influence of the\
Holy Ghost is spine-tingling!\
11:50\
We experience what the\
Prophet Joseph Smith\
11:52\
knew when he taught,\
"By union of feeling\
11:58\
we obtain power with God."\
12:04\
No member of the\
First Presidency\
12:05\
or Quorum of the\
Twelve would ever\
12:07\
leave decisions for the\
Lord's Church to his own best\
12:13\
judgment!\
12:15\
Brothers and sisters, how can\
we become the men and women--the\
12:20\
Christlike servants--the\
Lord needs us to be?\
12:24\
How can we find answers to\
questions that perplex us?\
12:29\
If Joseph Smith's transcendent\
experience in the Sacred Grove\
12:34\
teaches us anything, it is\
that the heavens are open\
12:38\
and that God speaks\
to His children.\
12:43\
The Prophet Joseph Smith\
set a pattern for us\
12:45\
to follow in resolving\
our questions.\
12:48\
Drawn to the promise of\
James that if we lack wisdom\
12:52\
we may ask of God,\
the boy Joseph\
12:55\
took his question directly\
to Heavenly Father.\
13:00\
He sought personal\
revelation, and his seeking\
13:04\
opened this last dispensation.\
13:09\
In like manner, what will\
your seeking open for you?\
13:16\
What wisdom do you lack?\
13:19\
What do you feel an urgent\
need to know or understand?\
13:25\
Follow the example of\
the Prophet Joseph.\
13:28\
Find a quiet place where\
you can regularly go.\
13:33\
Humble yourself before God.\
13:36\
Pour out your heart to\
your Heavenly Father.\
13:40\
Turn to Him for answers\
and for comfort.\
13:46\
Pray in the name of Jesus\
Christ about your concerns,\
13:49\
your fears, your\
weaknesses--yes,\
13:52\
the very longings of your heart.\
13:56\
And then listen!\
14:01\
Write the thoughts\
that come to your mind.\
14:03\
Record your feelings and\
follow through with actions\
14:06\
that you are prompted to take.\
14:08\
As you repeat this process day\
after day, month after month,\
14:14\
year after year, you will\
"grow into the principle\
14:19\
of revelation."\
14:24\
Does God really want\
to speak to you?\
14:29\
Yes!\
14:31\
"As well might man stretch\
forth his puny arm to stop\
14:35\
the Missouri river in\
its decreed course ...\
14:38\
as to hinder the Almighty\
from pouring down\
14:41\
knowledge from\
heaven upon the heads\
14:43\
of the Latter-day Saints."\
14:47\
You don't have to wonder\
about what is true.\
14:50\
You do not have to wonder\
whom you can safely trust.\
14:55\
Through personal revelation,\
you can receive your own witness\
15:00\
that the Book of Mormon\
is the word of God,\
15:03\
that Joseph Smith is a\
prophet of this dispensation,\
15:07\
and that this is\
the Lord's Church.\
15:11\
Regardless of what\
others may say or do,\
15:15\
no one can ever take away a\
witness borne to your heart\
15:20\
and mind about what is true.\
15:25\
I urge you to stretch beyond\
your current spiritual ability\
15:29\
to receive personal revelation,\
for the Lord has promised that\
15:34\
"if thou shalt [seek], thou\
shalt receive revelation upon\
15:38\
revelation, knowledge\
upon knowledge,\
15:42\
that thou mayest know the\
mysteries and peaceable\
15:46\
things--that which bringeth\
joy, that which bringeth life\
15:52\
eternal."\
15:57\
There is so much more\
that your Father in Heaven\
15:59\
wants you to know.\
16:01\
As Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught,\
"To those who have eyes to see\
16:06\
and ears to hear, it is clear\
that the Father and the Son\
16:09\
are giving away the\
secrets of the universe!"\
16:18\
Nothing opens the heavens\
quite like the combination\
16:21\
of increased purity,\
exact obedience,\
16:27\
earnest seeking, daily\
feasting on the words of Christ\
16:33\
in the Book of Mormon,\
and regular time\
16:36\
committed to temple and\
family history work.\
16:41\
To be sure, there may be\
times when you feel as\
16:43\
though the heavens are closed.\
16:45\
But I promise that as you\
continue to be obedient,\
16:49\
expressing gratitude for every\
blessing the Lord gives you,\
16:55\
and as you patiently honor\
the Lord's timetable,\
17:00\
you will be given the knowledge\
and understanding you seek.\
17:06\
Every blessing the Lord has\
for you--even miracles--will\
17:12\
follow.\
17:13\
That is what personal\
revelation will do for you.\
17:19\
I am optimistic\
about the future.\
17:22\
It will be filled with\
opportunities for each of us\
17:25\
to progress, contribute,\
and take the gospel\
17:30\
to every corner of the earth.\
17:34\
But I am also not naive\
about the days ahead.\
17:38\
We live in a world that is\
complex and increasingly\
17:42\
contentious.\
17:43\
The constant availability of\
social media and a 24-hour news\
17:50\
cycle bombard us with\
relentless messages.\
17:53\
If we are to have any\
hope of sifting through\
17:57\
the myriad of voices and\
the philosophies of men\
18:00\
that attack truth, we must\
learn to receive revelation.\
18:08\
Our Savior and\
Redeemer, Jesus Christ,\
18:10\
will perform some of His\
mightiest works between now\
18:14\
and when He comes again.\
18:16\
We will see\
miraculous indications\
18:20\
that God the Father and\
His Son, Jesus Christ,\
18:24\
preside over this earth\
in majesty and glory.\
18:30\
But in coming days,\
it will not be\
18:32\
possible to survive\
spiritually without\
18:36\
the guiding, directing,\
and comforting and constant\
18:40\
influence of the Holy Ghost.\
18:44\
My beloved brothers and\
sisters, I plead with you\
18:49\
to increase your spiritual\
capacity to receive revelation.\
18:53\
Let this Easter Sunday be a\
defining moment in your life.\
18:58\
Choose to do the\
spiritual work required\
19:01\
to enjoy the gift\
of the Holy Ghost\
19:04\
and hear the voice of the\
Spirit more frequently\
19:07\
and more clearly.\
19:10\
With Moroni, I exhort you\
on this Easter Sabbath\
19:14\
to "come unto\
Christ, and lay hold\
19:18\
upon every good gift,"\
beginning with the gift\
19:22\
of the Holy Ghost, which gift\
can and will change your life.\
19:29\
We are followers\
of Jesus Christ.\
19:32\
The most important truth\
the Holy Ghost will ever\
19:35\
witness to you is that\
Jesus is the Christ,\
19:39\
the Son of the living God.\
19:41\
He lives!\
19:43\
He is our Advocate with\
the Father, our Exemplar,\
19:48\
and our Redeemer.\
19:50\
On this Easter\
Sunday, we commemorate\
19:53\
His atoning sacrifice,\
His literal Resurrection,\
19:57\
and His divinity.\
19:59\
This is His Church, restored\
through the Prophet Joseph\
20:03\
Smith.\
20:04\
I so testify, with my expression\
of love for each of you,\
20:11\
in the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
