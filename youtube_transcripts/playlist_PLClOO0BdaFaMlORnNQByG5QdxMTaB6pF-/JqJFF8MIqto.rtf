Brethren, it is a\
privilege to be with you\
0:05\
in this historic conference.\
0:07\
When I was a new\
mission president,\
0:09\
I was excited to\
receive our first group\
0:11\
of new missionaries.\
0:13\
A few of our more\
experienced missionaries\
0:15\
were preparing for a\
brief meeting with them.\
0:17\
I noticed that they had\
arranged children's chairs\
0:20\
in a semicircle.\
0:23\
"What's up with\
the little chairs?"\
0:25\
I asked.\
0:26\
The missionaries,\
somewhat sheepishly,\
0:28\
said, "For the\
new missionaries."\
0:31\
I believe the way we\
see others significantly\
0:34\
impacts their perception\
of who they are\
0:38\
and what they can become.\
0:39\
Our new missionaries sat\
on adult chairs that day.\
0:44\
Sometimes, I fear,\
we figuratively\
0:47\
give our young men of the\
Aaronic Priesthood children's\
0:50\
chairs to sit on\
rather than helping\
0:52\
them see that God has given them\
a sacred trust and a vital work\
0:58\
to do.\
0:59\
President Thomas S. Monson\
counseled us that young men\
1:03\
need to understand\
"what it means ...\
1:05\
to be bearers of the\
priesthood of God.\
1:08\
They need to be guided\
to a spiritual awareness\
1:11\
of the sacredness of\
their ordained calling."\
1:15\
Today I pray the Holy\
Ghost will guide us\
1:19\
to a greater\
understanding of the power\
1:22\
and sacredness of the\
Aaronic Priesthood\
1:24\
and inspire us to\
focus more diligently\
1:28\
on our priesthood duties.\
1:30\
My message is for all\
Aaronic Priesthood holders,\
1:34\
including those who also hold\
the Melchizedek Priesthood.\
1:39\
Elder Dale G. Renlund\
taught that the purpose\
1:42\
of the priesthood is to\
provide God's children\
1:45\
access to the atoning\
power of Jesus Christ.\
1:48\
To receive Christ's\
atoning power in our lives,\
1:52\
we must believe in Him,\
repent of our sins,\
1:56\
make and keep sacred\
covenants through ordinances,\
1:59\
and receive the Holy Ghost.\
2:01\
These are not principles\
we engage in just once;\
2:05\
rather, they work together,\
reinforcing and building\
2:08\
on each other in a continuing\
process of upward progression\
2:13\
to "come unto Christ,\
and be perfected in him."\
2:18\
So what is the role of the\
Aaronic Priesthood in this?\
2:21\
How does it help us gain access\
to Christ's atoning power?\
2:25\
I believe the answer lies\
in the keys of the Aaronic\
2:29\
Priesthood--the keys of\
the ministering of angels\
2:33\
and of the preparatory gospel.\
2:36\
Let's begin with one aspect\
of the ministering of angels.\
2:40\
Before God's children can\
have faith in Jesus Christ,\
2:45\
they need to know Him\
and be taught His gospel.\
2:48\
As the Apostle Paul said:\
2:51\
"How shall they believe in him\
of whom they have not heard?\
2:55\
and how shall they hear\
without a preacher?\
2:57\
"And how shall they preach,\
except they be sent?\
2:59\
...\
3:00\
"So then faith cometh\
by hearing, and hearing\
3:05\
by the word of God."\
3:07\
From the beginning of time, God\
has "sent angels to minister\
3:11\
unto the children of\
men, to make manifest ...\
3:14\
the coming of Christ."\
3:16\
Angels are heavenly beings\
bearing God's message.\
3:21\
In both Hebrew and Greek,\
the root word of angel\
3:25\
is "messenger."\
3:27\
In much the same way that\
angels are authorized messengers\
3:32\
sent by God to declare\
His word and thereby\
3:35\
build faith, we who hold\
the Aaronic Priesthood have\
3:39\
been ordained to\
"teach, and invite\
3:42\
all to come unto Christ."\
3:44\
To preach the gospel\
is a priesthood duty.\
3:47\
And the power associated\
with this duty\
3:49\
is not just for prophets or\
even just for missionaries.\
3:53\
It is for you!\
3:55\
So how do we get this power?\
3:57\
How does a 12-year-old\
deacon--or any of us--bring\
4:01\
faith in Christ to the\
hearts of God's children?\
4:05\
We start by treasuring up His\
word so its power is within us.\
4:12\
He has promised that if we do,\
we will have "the power of God\
4:17\
unto the convincing of men."\
4:19\
It may be an opportunity to\
teach in a quorum meeting\
4:22\
or visit the home of a member.\
4:24\
It may be something less\
formal, like a conversation\
4:27\
with a friend or\
a family member.\
4:29\
In any of these settings,\
if we have prepared,\
4:33\
we can teach the gospel\
the way angels do:\
4:36\
by the power of the Holy Ghost.\
4:40\
I recently heard Jacob,\
an Aaronic Priesthood\
4:43\
holder in Papua\
New Guinea, testify\
4:45\
of the power of\
the Book of Mormon\
4:48\
and how it has helped him resist\
evil and follow the Spirit.\
4:52\
His words increased my faith\
and the faith of others.\
4:56\
My faith has also\
grown as I have\
4:58\
heard Aaronic Priesthood\
holders teach and testify\
5:01\
in their quorum meetings.\
5:04\
Young men, you are\
authorized messengers.\
5:08\
Through your words and actions,\
you can bring faith in Christ\
5:13\
to the hearts of God's children.\
5:15\
As President Russell M.\
Nelson said, "To them\
5:19\
you will be as a\
ministering angel."\
5:23\
Increased faith in Christ\
always leads to a desire\
5:26\
to change or repent.\
5:28\
So it is logical that the key\
of the ministering of angels\
5:32\
would be accompanied by the\
key of the preparatory gospel,\
5:35\
"the gospel of repentance\
and of baptism,\
5:38\
and the remission of sins."\
5:40\
As you study your Aaronic\
Priesthood duties,\
5:43\
you will see a clear\
charge to invite\
5:46\
others to repent and improve.\
5:49\
That does not mean we\
stand on street corners\
5:51\
shouting, "Repent ye!"\
5:53\
More often, it means that\
we repent, we forgive,\
5:59\
and as we minister to others, we\
offer the hope that repentance\
6:04\
brings--because we have\
experienced it ourselves.\
6:09\
I have been with Aaronic\
Priesthood holders\
6:11\
as they visited\
fellow quorum members.\
6:13\
I have witnessed their\
care soften hearts and help\
6:17\
their brothers feel God's love.\
6:19\
I heard one young\
man bear testimony\
6:22\
to his peers of the\
power of repentance.\
6:25\
As he did, hearts were\
softened, commitments were made,\
6:30\
and the healing power\
of Christ was felt.\
6:34\
President Gordon\
B. Hinckley taught:\
6:36\
"It is one thing to repent.\
6:38\
It is another to have our\
sins remitted or forgiven.\
6:43\
The power to bring\
this about is found\
6:47\
in the Aaronic Priesthood."\
6:50\
The Aaronic\
Priesthood ordinances\
6:52\
of baptism and the\
sacrament witness\
6:56\
and complete our repentance\
for a remission of sins.\
7:01\
President Dallin H. Oaks\
explained it this way:\
7:04\
"We are commanded to\
repent of our sins and ...\
7:06\
come to the Lord with a broken\
heart and a contrite spirit\
7:09\
and partake of the sacrament.\
7:11\
...\
7:11\
When we renew our baptismal\
covenants in this way,\
7:15\
the Lord renews the cleansing\
effect of our baptism."\
7:20\
Brethren, it is a sacred\
and holy privilege\
7:23\
to administer ordinances that\
bring a remission of sins\
7:28\
to repentant hearts.\
7:31\
I was recently told\
of a priest who\
7:32\
struggles to express himself\
blessing the sacrament\
7:35\
for the first time.\
7:36\
As he did, a\
powerful spirit came\
7:39\
over him and the congregation.\
7:41\
Later in the meeting he bore\
a simple but clear testimony\
7:45\
of the power of God that he\
felt during that ordinance.\
7:49\
In Sydney, Australia, four\
members of a priests quorum\
7:53\
baptized members of\
the Mbuelongo family.\
7:55\
The mother of one\
of these priests\
7:57\
related to me how this\
experience powerfully\
8:00\
impacted her son.\
8:02\
These priests came\
to understand what\
8:04\
it means to be "commissioned\
of Jesus Christ."\
8:09\
As you know, priests\
can now officiate\
8:11\
in performing proxy\
baptisms in the temple.\
8:14\
My 17-year-old son\
recently baptized me\
8:18\
for some of our ancestors.\
8:20\
We both felt deep gratitude\
for the Aaronic Priesthood\
8:24\
and the privilege of acting\
for the salvation of God's\
8:28\
children.\
8:31\
Young men, as you\
diligently engage\
8:33\
in your priesthood duties,\
you participate with God\
8:37\
in His work "to bring to pass\
the immortality and eternal\
8:41\
life of man."\
8:43\
Experiences like these\
increase your desire\
8:47\
and prepare you to teach\
repentance and baptize converts\
8:52\
as missionaries.\
8:53\
They also prepare you\
for lifelong service\
8:56\
in the Melchizedek Priesthood.\
8:58\
Aaronic Priesthood holders,\
we have the privilege and duty\
9:02\
to be fellow servants\
with John the Baptist.\
9:05\
John was sent as an authorized\
messenger to bear witness\
9:08\
of Christ and invite all to\
repent and be baptized--that\
9:13\
is, he exercised the Aaronic\
Priesthood keys we have\
9:16\
discussed.\
9:17\
John then declared, "I indeed\
baptize you with water unto\
9:23\
repentance: but he that cometh\
after me is mightier than I ...\
9:27\
: he shall baptize you with\
the Holy Ghost, and with fire."\
9:33\
Thus, the Aaronic\
Priesthood, with the keys\
9:36\
of the ministering of angels\
and the preparatory gospel,\
9:40\
prepares the way\
for God's children\
9:43\
to receive, through the\
Melchizedek Priesthood,\
9:46\
the gift of the Holy\
Ghost, the greatest gift we\
9:50\
can receive in this life.\
9:53\
What a profound\
responsibility God\
9:56\
has given to Aaronic\
Priesthood holders!\
9:59\
Parents and priesthood leaders,\
can you sense the importance\
10:03\
of President Monson's counsel to\
help young men understand "what\
10:07\
it means ... to be bearers\
of the priesthood of God"?\
10:11\
Understanding and magnifying\
the Aaronic Priesthood\
10:15\
will prepare them to be\
faithful Melchizedek Priesthood\
10:17\
holders, power-filled\
missionaries,\
10:20\
and righteous\
husbands and fathers.\
10:22\
Through their service, they\
will understand and feel\
10:25\
the reality of priesthood\
power, the power\
10:29\
to act in the name of\
Christ for the salvation\
10:31\
of God's children.\
10:34\
Young men, God has a\
work for you to do.\
10:37\
Your Aaronic\
Priesthood ordination\
10:40\
is central to helping\
His children receive\
10:42\
Christ's atoning power.\
10:44\
I promise, as you put\
these sacred duties\
10:47\
at the center of your life,\
you will feel the power of God\
10:51\
as never before.\
10:52\
You will understand\
your identity\
10:54\
as a son of God, called with\
a holy calling to do His work.\
11:00\
And, like John the Baptist,\
you will help prepare the way\
11:04\
for the coming of His Son.\
11:07\
Of these truths I bear\
witness in the name\
11:10\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
