I rejoice in the opportunity\
to sustain our Church leaders,\
0:06\
and I wholeheartedly welcome\
Elder Gong and Elder Soares\
0:10\
to the Quorum of\
the Twelve Apostles.\
0:12\
The ministries of\
these faithful men\
0:14\
will bless individuals and\
families all over the earth.\
0:19\
And I am eager to serve\
with and learn from them.\
0:32\
I pray that the Holy Ghost\
will teach and enlighten us\
0:37\
as we now learn together about\
a vital aspect of the Savior's\
0:41\
divine nature that each of\
us should strive to emulate.\
0:46\
I will present several examples\
that highlight this Christlike\
0:50\
quality before identifying\
the specific attribute later\
0:54\
in my message.\
0:56\
Please listen to each\
example and consider with me\
1:00\
possible answers to the\
questions I will pose.\
1:05\
EXAMPLE NUMBER 1:\
In the New Testament\
1:08\
we learn about a\
rich young man who\
1:10\
asked Jesus, "Good Master,\
what good thing shall\
1:14\
I do, that I may\
have eternal life?"\
1:16\
The Savior first admonished\
him to keep the commandments.\
1:20\
The Master next\
gave the young man\
1:23\
an additional\
requirement customized\
1:25\
to his specific needs\
and circumstances.\
1:29\
"Jesus said unto him, If thou\
wilt be perfect, go and sell\
1:34\
that thou hast, and\
give to the poor,\
1:37\
and thou shalt have treasure in\
heaven: and come and follow me.\
1:43\
"But when the young\
man heard that saying,\
1:44\
he went away sorrowful: for\
he had great possessions."\
1:49\
Compare the response\
of the rich young man\
1:51\
with the experience of\
Amulek, as described\
1:54\
in the Book of Mormon.\
1:56\
Amulek was an industrious\
and prosperous man\
2:00\
with many kindreds and friends.\
2:02\
He described himself as a\
man who was called many times\
2:06\
but would not hear, a man\
who knew the things of God\
2:09\
but would not know.\
2:11\
A basically good man,\
Amulek was distracted\
2:14\
by worldly concerns much\
like the rich young man\
2:18\
described in the New Testament.\
2:21\
Even though he had previously\
hardened his heart,\
2:24\
Amulek obeyed the\
voice of an angel,\
2:26\
received the prophet\
Alma in his home,\
2:29\
and provided nourishment to him.\
2:32\
He was spiritually awakened\
during Alma's visit\
2:35\
and was called to\
preach the gospel.\
2:38\
Alma then forsook "all\
his gold, and silver,\
2:42\
and his precious things\
... for the word of God,\
2:45\
[and was] rejected by those who\
were once his friends and also\
2:49\
by his father and his kindred."\
2:54\
What do you think\
explains the difference\
2:56\
between the responses of the\
rich young man and Amulek?\
3:01\
EXAMPLE NUMBER 2:\
During a perilous period\
3:04\
of war described in the Book of\
Mormon, an exchange of epistles\
3:08\
occurred between Moroni, the\
captain of the Nephite armies,\
3:12\
and Pahoran, the chief judge\
and governor of the land.\
3:16\
Moroni, whose army was suffering\
because of inadequate support\
3:20\
from the government,\
wrote to Pahoran\
3:22\
"by the way of\
condemnation" and accused\
3:25\
him and his fellow leaders of\
thoughtlessness, slothfulness,\
3:30\
neglect, and even\
being traitors.\
3:34\
Pahoran easily might\
have resented Moroni\
3:36\
and his inaccurate\
allegations, but he did not.\
3:40\
He responded compassionately\
and described a rebellion\
3:44\
against the government about\
which Moroni was not aware.\
3:48\
And then Pahoran\
declared, "Behold,\
3:51\
I say unto you,\
Moroni, that I do not\
3:54\
joy in your great afflictions,\
yea, it grieves my soul.\
3:58\
...\
3:59\
"In your epistle you\
have censured me,\
4:02\
but it mattereth not; I am\
not angry, but do rejoice\
4:07\
in the greatness of your heart."\
4:10\
What do you think explains\
Pahoran's measured reply\
4:14\
to Moroni's accusations?\
4:19\
EXAMPLE NUMBER 3: In general\
conference six months ago,\
4:22\
President Russell M. Nelson\
described his response\
4:26\
to President Thomas\
S. Monson's invitation\
4:29\
to study, ponder, and\
apply the truths contained\
4:32\
in the Book of Mormon.\
4:34\
He said: "I have tried\
to follow his counsel.\
4:38\
Among other things,\
I've made lists\
4:40\
of what the Book of Mormon\
is, what it affirms,\
4:43\
what it refutes, what it\
fulfills, what it clarifies,\
4:47\
and what it reveals.\
4:49\
Looking at the Book of Mormon\
through these lenses has been\
4:52\
... insightful and\
inspiring ... !\
4:55\
I recommend it to each of you."\
4:59\
In the same conference,\
President Henry B. Eyring\
5:02\
likewise emphasized\
the importance\
5:04\
in his life of President\
Monson's request.\
5:07\
He observed: "I have read\
the Book of Mormon every day\
5:11\
for more than 50 years.\
5:13\
So perhaps I could\
have reasonably thought\
5:16\
that President Monson's\
words were for someone else.\
5:19\
Yet, like many of you, I felt\
the prophet's encouragement\
5:24\
and his promise invite me\
to make a greater effort.\
5:27\
...\
5:28\
"The happy result for\
me, and for many of you,\
5:31\
has been what the\
prophet promised."\
5:35\
What do you think explains\
the immediate and heartfelt\
5:39\
responses to President\
Monson's invitation\
5:42\
by these two leaders\
of the Lord's Church?\
5:47\
I am not suggesting that the\
spiritually strong responses\
5:50\
of Amulek, Pahoran, President\
Nelson, and President Eyring\
5:54\
are explained by only\
one Christlike quality.\
5:58\
Certainly, many interrelated\
attributes and experiences\
6:02\
led to the spiritual maturity\
reflected in the lives\
6:06\
of these four noble servants.\
6:09\
But the Savior and His\
prophets have highlighted\
6:12\
an essential quality\
that all of us\
6:15\
need to more fully\
understand and strive\
6:18\
to incorporate into our lives.\
6:22\
Please notice the\
characteristic the Lord\
6:24\
used to describe Himself\
in the following scripture:\
6:29\
"Take my yoke upon\
you, and learn of me;\
6:32\
for I am meek and\
lowly in heart:\
6:35\
and ye shall find\
rest unto your souls."\
6:39\
Instructively, the Savior\
chose to emphasize meekness\
6:44\
from among all the attributes\
and virtues He potentially\
6:47\
could have selected.\
6:50\
A similar pattern is evident\
in a revelation received\
6:53\
by the Prophet\
Joseph Smith in 1829.\
6:56\
The Lord declared, "Learn of\
me, and listen to my words;\
7:02\
walk in the meekness\
of my Spirit,\
7:04\
and you shall have peace in me."\
7:08\
Meekness is a defining\
attribute of the Redeemer\
7:13\
and is distinguished by\
righteous responsiveness,\
7:17\
willing submissiveness,\
and strong self-restraint.\
7:23\
This quality helps us to\
understand more completely\
7:27\
the respective reactions of\
Amulek, Pahoran, President\
7:30\
Nelson, and President Eyring.\
7:34\
For example, President\
Nelson and President Eyring\
7:36\
righteously and\
rapidly responded\
7:39\
to President Monson's\
encouragement to read and study\
7:42\
the Book of Mormon.\
7:43\
Though both men were serving\
in important and visible Church\
7:47\
positions and had studied\
the scriptures extensively\
7:51\
for decades, they demonstrated\
in their responses\
7:55\
no hesitation or sense\
of self-importance.\
8:00\
Amulek willingly\
submitted to God's will,\
8:03\
accepted a call to\
preach the gospel,\
8:06\
and left behind his\
comfortable circumstances\
8:09\
and familiar relationships.\
8:12\
And Pahoran was blessed\
with perspective\
8:15\
and strong self-restraint\
to act rather than react\
8:19\
as he explained to Moroni\
the challenges arising\
8:23\
from a rebellion\
against the government.\
8:26\
The Christlike\
quality of meekness\
8:28\
often is misunderstood in\
our contemporary world.\
8:32\
Meekness is strong,\
not weak; active,\
8:37\
not passive;\
courageous, not timid;\
8:42\
restrained, not excessive;\
modest, not self-aggrandizing;\
8:49\
and gracious, not brash.\
8:53\
A meek person is not easily\
provoked, pretentious,\
8:57\
or overbearing and\
readily acknowledges\
9:00\
the accomplishments of others.\
9:03\
Whereas humility denotes\
generally a dependence upon God\
9:08\
and the constant need for\
His guidance and support,\
9:11\
a distinguishing\
characteristic of meekness\
9:15\
is a particular\
spiritual receptivity\
9:19\
to learning both from the\
Holy Ghost and from people\
9:24\
who may seem less\
capable, experienced,\
9:28\
or educated, who may not\
hold important positions,\
9:32\
or who otherwise may not appear\
to have much to contribute.\
9:37\
Recall how Naaman, captain\
of the king's army in Syria,\
9:41\
overcame his pride\
and meekly accepted\
9:45\
the advice of his\
servants to obey Elisha\
9:48\
the prophet and wash in the\
river Jordan seven times.\
9:53\
Meekness is the\
principal protection\
9:57\
from the prideful\
blindness that often\
10:00\
arises from prominence,\
position, power, wealth,\
10:04\
and adulation.\
10:08\
Meekness is an attribute\
developed through desire,\
10:11\
the righteous exercise\
of moral agency,\
10:15\
and striving always to retain\
a remission of our sins.\
10:19\
It also is a spiritual gift\
for which we appropriately\
10:23\
can seek.\
10:24\
We should remember, however,\
the purposes for which\
10:27\
such a blessing is given,\
even to benefit and serve\
10:31\
the children of God.\
10:34\
As we come unto and\
follow the Savior,\
10:36\
we increasingly\
and incrementally\
10:38\
are enabled to\
become more like Him.\
10:41\
We are empowered by the Spirit\
with disciplined self-restraint\
10:46\
and a settled and calm demeanor.\
10:49\
Thus, meek is what we become as\
disciples of the Master and not\
10:54\
just something we do.\
10:57\
Moses "was learned in all\
the wisdom of the Egyptians,\
11:01\
and was mighty in\
words and in deeds."\
11:03\
Yet he "was very meek,\
above all the men\
11:07\
which were upon the\
face of the earth."\
11:09\
His knowledge and\
competence could\
11:12\
have caused him to be prideful.\
11:13\
Instead, the attribute\
and spiritual gift\
11:17\
of meekness with\
which he was blessed\
11:20\
attenuated arrogance in his\
life and magnified Moses\
11:24\
as an instrument to\
accomplish God's purposes.\
11:29\
The most majestic and\
meaningful examples of meekness\
11:33\
are found in the life\
of the Savior Himself.\
11:37\
The Great Redeemer, who\
"descended below all things"\
11:41\
and suffered, bled,\
and died "to cleanse us\
11:44\
from all\
unrighteousness," tenderly\
11:48\
washed the dusty feet\
of His disciples.\
11:52\
Such meekness is a\
hallmark characteristic\
11:55\
of the Lord as a\
servant and leader.\
12:00\
Jesus provides the ultimate\
example of righteous\
12:03\
responsiveness and\
willing submission\
12:05\
as He suffered intense\
agony in Gethsemane.\
12:11\
"And when he was at the place,\
he said unto [His disciples],\
12:14\
Pray that ye enter\
not into temptation.\
12:18\
"And he ... kneeled\
down, and prayed,\
12:21\
"Saying, Father,\
if thou be willing,\
12:23\
remove this cup from me:\
nevertheless not my will,\
12:27\
but thine, be done."\
12:30\
The Savior's meekness\
in this eternally\
12:34\
essential and\
excruciating experience\
12:37\
demonstrates for each\
of us the importance\
12:40\
of putting the wisdom of\
God above our own wisdom.\
12:45\
The consistency of the\
Lord's willing submission\
12:48\
and strong self-restraint\
is both awe-inspiring and\
12:52\
instructive for us all.\
12:55\
As an armed company of temple\
guardsmen and Roman soldiers\
12:59\
arrived at Gethsemane to\
seize and arrest Jesus,\
13:03\
Peter drew his sword and\
cut off the right ear\
13:06\
of the high priest's servant.\
13:08\
The Savior then touched the\
servant's ear and healed him.\
13:14\
Please note that He\
reached out and blessed\
13:18\
His potential captor using\
the same heavenly power that\
13:24\
could have prevented Him from\
being captured and crucified.\
13:30\
Consider also how the Master\
was accused and condemned\
13:33\
before Pilate to be crucified.\
13:36\
Jesus had declared\
during His betrayal,\
13:39\
"Thinkest thou that I cannot\
now pray to my Father,\
13:43\
and he shall presently give\
me more than twelve legions\
13:46\
of angels?"\
13:47\
Yet the "Eternal Judge of both\
quick and dead" paradoxically\
13:53\
was judged before a temporary\
political appointee.\
13:58\
"And [Jesus] answered him\
to never a word; insomuch\
14:03\
that the governor\
marvelled greatly."\
14:06\
The Savior's\
meekness is evidenced\
14:09\
in His disciplined\
response, strong restraint,\
14:13\
and unwillingness to\
exert His infinite power\
14:17\
for personal benefit.\
14:20\
Mormon identifies\
meekness as the foundation\
14:23\
from which all spiritual\
capacities and gifts arise.\
14:28\
"Wherefore, if a man have\
faith he must needs have hope;\
14:32\
for without faith there\
cannot be any hope.\
14:36\
"And again, behold I say unto\
you that he cannot have faith\
14:39\
and hope, save he shall be\
meek, and lowly of heart.\
14:43\
"If so, his faith\
and hope is vain,\
14:46\
for none is\
acceptable before God,\
14:49\
save the meek and\
lowly in heart;\
14:52\
and if a man be meek\
and lowly in heart,\
14:54\
and confesses by the\
power of the Holy Ghost\
14:57\
that Jesus is the\
Christ, he must needs\
15:00\
have charity; for if he have\
not charity he is nothing;\
15:03\
wherefore he must\
needs have charity."\
15:08\
The Savior declared,\
"Blessed are the meek:\
15:10\
for they shall\
inherit the earth."\
15:12\
Meekness is an essential\
aspect of the divine nature\
15:17\
and can be received and\
developed in our lives\
15:20\
because of and through\
the Savior's Atonement.\
15:26\
I testify that Jesus Christ\
is our resurrected and living\
15:31\
Redeemer.\
15:32\
And I promise that He will\
guide, protect, and strengthen\
15:37\
us as we walk in the\
meekness of His spirit.\
15:41\
I declare my sure witness\
of these truths and promises\
15:46\
in the sacred name of the\
Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
