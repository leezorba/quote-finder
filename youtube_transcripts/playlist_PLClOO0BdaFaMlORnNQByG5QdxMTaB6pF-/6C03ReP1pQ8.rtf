We love and miss\
President Monson,\
0:04\
and we love and sustain\
our dear President Nelson.\
0:08\
President Nelson has a\
special place in my heart.\
0:12\
When I was a young father,\
our little son, who was five,\
0:16\
came home from school\
one day and asked\
0:18\
his mother, "What kind\
of work does Daddy do?"\
0:22\
He then explained that his new\
classmates started debating\
0:26\
about their fathers' jobs.\
0:28\
One said that his father was\
the chief of the city police,\
0:32\
while another proudly\
declared that his father was\
0:35\
the chief of a big company.\
0:37\
So when asked about his\
father, my son simply said,\
0:41\
"My father works in an\
office on a computer."\
0:45\
Then, noticing that\
his answer did not\
0:48\
impress his new\
little friends much,\
0:50\
he added, "And by\
the way, my father\
0:54\
is the chief of the universe."\
0:59\
I guess that was the\
end of the conversation.\
1:03\
I told my wife, "It's\
time to teach him\
1:06\
some more details of\
the plan of salvation\
1:09\
and who is really in charge."\
1:12\
But as we taught our children\
the plan of salvation,\
1:15\
their love for Heavenly\
Father and for the Savior\
1:19\
grew as they learned that\
it is a plan of love.\
1:23\
The gospel of Jesus\
Christ is centered\
1:26\
on the love of the Father\
and the Savior for us\
1:30\
and our love for Them\
and for one another.\
1:34\
ELDER JEFFREY R. HOLLAND SAID:\
"The first great commandment\
1:38\
of all eternity is to love God\
with all of our heart, might,\
1:43\
mind, and strength--that's\
the first great commandment.\
1:47\
But the first great\
truth of all eternity\
1:50\
is that God loves us with all\
of His heart, might, mind,\
1:56\
and strength.\
1:57\
That love is the foundation\
stone of eternity,\
2:01\
and it should be the foundation\
stone of our daily life."\
2:08\
Being the foundation\
stone of our daily life,\
2:10\
pure love is a requirement\
for every true disciple\
2:15\
of Jesus Christ.\
2:18\
The prophet Mormon\
taught, "Wherefore,\
2:21\
my beloved brethren,\
pray unto the Father\
2:25\
with all the energy\
of heart, that ye\
2:27\
may be filled with\
this love, which\
2:30\
he hath bestowed\
upon all who are\
2:33\
true followers of his\
Son, Jesus Christ."\
2:37\
Love indeed is the true\
sign of every true disciple\
2:42\
of Jesus Christ.\
2:45\
True disciples love to serve.\
2:47\
They know that serving\
is an expression\
2:50\
of true love and a covenant\
they made at baptism.\
2:53\
Regardless of their\
callings in the Church\
2:56\
or their role in\
the community, they\
2:59\
feel an increasing\
desire to love and serve\
3:02\
the Lord and one another.\
3:06\
True disciples love to forgive.\
3:08\
They know that the\
Atonement of the Savior\
3:11\
covers all sins and\
mistakes of each one of us.\
3:15\
They know that the price He\
paid is an "all-included price."\
3:20\
Spiritual taxes, fees,\
commissions, and charges\
3:23\
related to sins, mistakes, or\
wrongdoings are all covered.\
3:28\
True disciples are\
quick to forgive\
3:31\
and quick to ask\
for forgiveness.\
3:34\
My dear brothers\
and sisters, if you\
3:37\
are struggling to find\
the strength to forgive,\
3:41\
don't think of what\
others have done to you,\
3:44\
but think of what the\
Lord has done for you,\
3:49\
and you will find peace in\
the redemptive blessings\
3:52\
of His Atonement.\
3:55\
True disciples love to\
submit themselves to the Lord\
3:59\
with peace in their heart.\
4:00\
They are humble and submissive\
because they love Him.\
4:06\
They have faith to\
fully accept His will,\
4:09\
not only in what He does\
but also in how and when.\
4:15\
True disciples know that the\
real blessings are not always\
4:19\
what they want but rather\
what the Lord wants for them.\
4:25\
True disciples love the\
Lord more than the world\
4:27\
and are steadfast and\
immovable in their faith.\
4:30\
They stay strong and firm in a\
changing and confusing world.\
4:35\
True disciples love to listen\
to the voice of the Spirit\
4:40\
and of the prophets\
and are not confused\
4:43\
by the voices of the world.\
4:45\
True disciples love to\
"stand in holy places"\
4:50\
and love to make holy the\
places where they stand.\
4:54\
Wherever they go, they bring\
the love of the Lord and peace\
5:00\
to the hearts of others.\
5:03\
True disciples love to obey\
the Lord's commandments,\
5:06\
and they obey because\
they love the Lord.\
5:10\
As they love and\
keep their covenants,\
5:13\
their hearts are renewed and\
their very nature changes.\
5:18\
Pure love is the true sign\
of every true disciple\
5:24\
of Jesus Christ.\
5:27\
I learned about pure\
love from my mother.\
5:30\
She was not a member\
of the Church.\
5:34\
One day, many years ago,\
I visited my mother,\
5:38\
who was struggling with cancer.\
5:40\
I knew that she\
was going to die,\
5:43\
but I was concerned\
that she was suffering.\
5:47\
I didn't say anything,\
but knowing me well,\
5:50\
she said, "I see that\
you are concerned."\
5:55\
Then to my surprise, she\
asked me with a feeble voice,\
5:59\
"Can you teach me how to pray?\
6:02\
I want to pray for you.\
6:05\
I know you start by\
saying, 'Dear Heavenly\
6:08\
Father,' but then\
what should I say?"\
6:12\
As I knelt next to her\
bed and she prayed for me,\
6:16\
I felt a love never felt before.\
6:20\
It was simple, true, pure love.\
6:26\
Although she didn't know\
about the plan of salvation,\
6:29\
she had in her heart\
her personal plan\
6:31\
of love, the plan of love\
of a mother for her son.\
6:36\
She was in pain, struggling to\
even find the strength to pray.\
6:42\
I could barely hear her voice,\
but I surely felt her love.\
6:48\
I remember thinking,\
"How can someone\
6:51\
who is in such great pain\
pray for someone else?\
6:55\
She is the one in need."\
6:58\
Then the answer came clearly\
to my mind: pure love.\
7:03\
She loved me so much that\
she forgot about herself.\
7:07\
In her most critical hour, she\
loved me more than herself.\
7:13\
Now, dear brothers and sisters,\
isn't this what the Savior did?\
7:18\
Of course, in an eternal and\
much broader perspective.\
7:21\
But in the midst of His greatest\
pain, in the garden that night,\
7:27\
He was the one who needed help,\
suffering in a way that we\
7:31\
cannot even imagine\
or comprehend.\
7:33\
But in the end, He\
forgot about Himself\
7:37\
and prayed for us until\
He paid the full price.\
7:41\
How was He able to do it?\
7:44\
Because of His pure love for\
the Father, who sent Him,\
7:48\
and for us.\
7:50\
He loved the Father and\
us more than Himself.\
7:55\
He paid for something\
that He had not done.\
7:57\
He paid for sins that\
He had not committed.\
7:59\
Why?\
8:01\
Pure love.\
8:03\
Having paid the full price,\
He was in the position\
8:07\
to offer us the\
blessings of what\
8:08\
He paid for if we would repent.\
8:11\
Why did He offer this?\
8:13\
Again, and always, pure love.\
8:18\
Pure love is the true sign\
of every true disciple\
8:23\
of Jesus Christ.\
8:26\
President Thomas S. Monson\
said: "May we begin now,\
8:30\
this very day, to express\
love to all of God's children,\
8:35\
whether they be our family\
members, our friends,\
8:38\
mere acquaintances,\
or total strangers.\
8:41\
As we arise each\
morning, let us determine\
8:43\
to respond with\
love and kindness\
8:45\
to whatever might come our way."\
8:48\
Brothers and sisters, the\
gospel of Jesus Christ\
8:51\
is a gospel of love.\
8:52\
The greatest commandment\
is about love.\
8:55\
For me, it's all about\
love--the love of the Father,\
8:59\
who sacrificed His Son for\
us; the love of the Savior,\
9:02\
who sacrificed all for us; the\
love of a mother or a father\
9:06\
who would give anything\
for their children;\
9:08\
the love of those who serve\
silently and are not known\
9:11\
to most of us but are\
well known to the Lord;\
9:14\
the love of those who\
forgive all and always;\
9:18\
the love of the ones who\
give more than they receive.\
9:21\
I love my Heavenly Father.\
9:23\
I love my Savior.\
9:24\
I love the gospel.\
9:26\
I love this Church.\
9:27\
I love my family.\
9:29\
I love this wonderful life.\
9:31\
For me, it's all about love.\
9:34\
May this day of remembrance of\
the Resurrection of the Savior\
9:38\
be a day of spiritual\
renewal for each one of us.\
9:42\
May this day be the\
beginning of a life\
9:45\
full of love, "the foundation\
stone of our daily life."\
9:50\
May our hearts be filled\
with the pure love\
9:53\
of Christ, the true sign of\
every true disciple of Jesus\
9:57\
Christ.\
9:58\
It is my prayer in the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
