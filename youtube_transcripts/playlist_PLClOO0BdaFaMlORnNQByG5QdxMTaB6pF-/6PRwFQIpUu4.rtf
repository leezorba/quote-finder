My dear brothers and\
sisters, wherever you may be,\
0:05\
I would like to express\
my sincere and deep thanks\
0:09\
for your sustaining\
vote yesterday.\
0:12\
Though I feel ineloquent and\
slow of speech like Moses,\
0:17\
I console myself in the\
Lord's words to him:\
0:22\
"Who hath made man's mouth?\
0:24\
or who maketh the dumb, or deaf,\
or the seeing, or the blind?\
0:28\
have not I the Lord?\
0:31\
"Now therefore go, and I\
will be with thy mouth,\
0:34\
and teach thee what\
thou shalt say."\
0:38\
I take solace also in the love\
and support of my beloved wife.\
0:42\
She has been an example of\
goodness, love, and total\
0:45\
devotion to the Lord and\
for me and my family.\
0:49\
I love her with every\
ounce of my heart,\
0:53\
and I am grateful for\
the positive influence\
0:56\
she has had on us.\
0:58\
Brothers and sisters, I\
want to testify to you today\
1:01\
that President Russell M. Nelson\
is the prophet of God on earth.\
1:07\
I have never seen anyone more\
kind and loving than he is.\
1:11\
Though I felt so inadequate\
for this sacred call,\
1:15\
his words and the\
tender look in his eyes\
1:18\
as he extended this\
responsibility made me feel\
1:21\
embraced by the Savior's love.\
1:24\
Thank you, President Nelson.\
1:27\
I sustain you, and I love you.\
1:31\
Isn't it a blessing to have\
prophets, seers, and revelators\
1:34\
on earth in these\
days in which we live,\
1:39\
who seek to know the will\
of the Lord and follow it?\
1:42\
It is comforting to know that\
we are not alone in the world,\
1:46\
despite the challenges\
we face in life.\
1:49\
Having prophets is a sign of\
God's love for His children.\
1:53\
They make known the promises\
and the true nature of God\
1:57\
and of Jesus Christ\
to Their people.\
1:59\
I have learned that through\
my own personal experiences.\
2:04\
Eighteen years\
ago, my wife and I\
2:06\
received a phone call from\
President James E. Faust, then\
2:10\
Second Counselor in\
the First Presidency.\
2:12\
He called us to serve as\
mission president and companion\
2:15\
in Portugal.\
2:17\
He told us that we\
had only six weeks\
2:20\
before we started the mission.\
2:21\
Although we felt\
unprepared and inadequate,\
2:24\
we accepted the call.\
2:26\
Our most important\
concern at the time\
2:29\
was to obtain the visas required\
to serve in that country\
2:33\
because, according\
to past experience,\
2:36\
we knew the process took six\
to eight months to complete.\
2:41\
President Faust then\
asked if we had faith\
2:45\
that the Lord would\
perform a miracle\
2:47\
and that we would be able to\
solve the visa problem faster.\
2:51\
Our answer was a\
big "Yes," and we\
2:55\
started making the\
arrangements immediately.\
2:57\
We prepared the documents\
required for the visas,\
3:01\
took our young family\
with our three kids,\
3:03\
and went to the consulate\
as fast as we could.\
3:07\
A very nice lady\
met with us there.\
3:10\
In reviewing our papers\
and getting acquainted\
3:13\
with what we were going to do\
in Portugal, she turned to us\
3:17\
and asked, "Are you\
really going to help\
3:20\
the people of my country?"\
3:21\
We firmly answered,\
"Yes," and explained\
3:25\
that we would represent Jesus\
Christ and testify of Him\
3:30\
and His divine\
mission in the world.\
3:32\
We returned there four weeks\
later, received our visas,\
3:37\
and landed in the mission\
field within the six weeks,\
3:41\
as a prophet of the\
Lord had asked us to do.\
3:45\
Brothers and sisters, I testify\
from the bottom of my heart\
3:49\
that the prophets speak by\
the power of the Holy Spirit.\
3:53\
They testify of Christ and\
His divine mission on earth.\
3:58\
They represent the mind\
and heart of the Lord\
4:01\
and are called to\
represent Him and teach us\
4:04\
what we must do to return to\
live in the presence of God\
4:08\
and His Son, Jesus Christ.\
4:10\
We are blessed as we\
exercise our faith\
4:13\
and follow their teachings.\
4:15\
By following them, our lives are\
happier and less complicated,\
4:21\
our difficulties and\
problems are easier to bear,\
4:24\
and we create a\
spiritual armor around us\
4:28\
that will protect us from the\
attack of the enemy in our day.\
4:33\
On this Easter day,\
I solemnly testify\
4:36\
that Jesus Christ\
is risen, He lives,\
4:40\
and He directs this Church on\
earth through His prophets,\
4:44\
seers, and revelators.\
4:46\
I testify that He is the Savior\
and the Redeemer of the world\
4:51\
and that through Him we\
can be saved and exalted\
4:56\
in the presence of our dear God.\
4:58\
I love Him; I adore Him.\
5:01\
I want to follow Him and do His\
will and become more like Him.\
5:06\
I humbly say these things in the\
sacred name of our Lord Jesus\
5:10\
Christ, amen.\
