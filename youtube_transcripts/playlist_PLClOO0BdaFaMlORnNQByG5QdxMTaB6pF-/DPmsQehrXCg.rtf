We thank Thee, O God,\
for our prophets.\
0:06\
Recently I went to church with\
my sweet mother at our old rock\
0:10\
chapel.\
0:11\
Drawn to little voices coming\
from the same Primary room I\
0:15\
attended decades ago,\
I walked in the back\
0:19\
and observed caring leaders\
teach this year's theme,\
0:22\
"I Am a Child of God."\
0:25\
I smiled as I remembered\
patient and loving teachers who,\
0:30\
during our singing\
time back then,\
0:33\
would often look at me--that\
rambunctious little boy\
0:36\
at the end of the\
pew--as if to say,\
0:38\
"Is he really a child of God?\
0:43\
And who has sent him here?"\
0:45\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:49\
I invite each of us to open our\
hearts to the Holy Ghost, who\
0:54\
"beareth witness\
with our spirit,\
0:56\
that we are the\
children of God."\
1:00\
President Boyd K. Packer's\
words are plain and precious:\
1:04\
"You are a child of God.\
1:07\
He is the father of your spirit.\
1:09\
Spiritually you are of\
noble birth, the offspring\
1:13\
of the King of Heaven.\
1:15\
Fix that truth in your\
mind and hold to it.\
1:18\
However many generations\
in your mortal ancestry,\
1:22\
no matter what race or\
people you represent,\
1:25\
the pedigree of your spirit can\
be written on a single line.\
1:29\
You are a child of God!"\
1:34\
"When you ... see our Father,"\
Brigham Young described,\
1:38\
"you will see a being with whom\
you have long been acquainted,\
1:42\
and he will receive\
you into his arms,\
1:45\
and you will be ready to fall\
into his embrace and kiss him."\
1:49\
The great war over\
divine identity.\
1:50\
Moses learned of his\
divine heritage talking\
1:54\
with the Lord face to face.\
1:56\
Following that\
experience, "Satan\
1:59\
came tempting" with subtle\
yet vicious intent to distort\
2:04\
Moses's identity, "saying:\
Moses, son of man, worship me.\
2:12\
And ...\
2:13\
Moses looked upon Satan\
and said: Who art thou?\
2:17\
For behold, I am a son of God."\
2:22\
This great war over divine\
identity rages fiercely\
2:25\
as Satan's proliferating\
arsenal aims\
2:28\
to destroy our belief in and\
knowledge of our relationship\
2:33\
with God.\
2:34\
Thankfully, we have been\
blessed with clear understanding\
2:39\
of our true identity\
from the beginning:\
2:42\
"And God said, Let us\
make man in our image,\
2:47\
after our likeness."\
2:49\
And His living\
prophets proclaim,\
2:52\
"Each is a beloved spirit son\
or daughter of heavenly parents,\
2:56\
and, as such, each has a\
divine nature and destiny."\
3:03\
Coming to know these truths\
with certainty helps us overcome\
3:07\
trials, troubles, and\
afflictions of every kind.\
3:11\
When asked, "How can we\
help those struggling\
3:15\
with a personal challenge?"\
3:17\
an Apostle of the Lord\
instructed, "Teach them\
3:21\
their identity and\
their purpose."\
3:22\
"The most powerful\
knowledge I possess."\
3:24\
These powerful truths were\
life-changing for my friend\
3:28\
Jen, who as a teenager caused\
a serious car accident.\
3:33\
Though her physical\
trauma was severe,\
3:37\
she felt exquisite pain because\
the other driver lost her life.\
3:43\
"Someone lost their mom, and\
it was my fault," she says.\
3:48\
Jen, who just days before stood\
and recited, "We are daughters\
3:54\
of our Heavenly\
Father, who loves us,"\
3:57\
now questioned, "How\
could He love me?"\
4:02\
"The physical suffering\
passed," she says,\
4:05\
"but I didn't think\
I would ever heal\
4:07\
from the emotional\
and spiritual wounds."\
4:10\
In order to survive, Jen\
hid her feelings deeply,\
4:13\
becoming distant and numb.\
4:15\
After a year, when\
she was finally\
4:18\
able to talk about the\
accident, an inspired counselor\
4:21\
invited her to write the\
phrase "I am a child of God"\
4:25\
and say it 10 times daily.\
4:28\
"Writing the words was\
easy," she recalls,\
4:31\
"but I couldn't speak them. ...\
4:33\
That made it real,\
and I didn't really\
4:36\
believe God wanted\
me as His child.\
4:39\
I would curl up and cry."\
4:43\
After several months,\
Jen was finally\
4:46\
able to complete\
the task every day.\
4:48\
"I poured out my whole soul,"\
she said, "pleading with God.\
4:54\
...\
4:54\
Then I began to\
believe the words."\
4:57\
This belief allowed\
the Savior to begin\
5:00\
mending her wounded soul.\
5:02\
The Book of Mormon brought\
comfort and courage\
5:05\
in His Atonement.\
5:06\
"Christ felt my pains,\
my sorrows, my guilt,"\
5:10\
Jen concludes.\
5:12\
"I felt God's pure love\
and had never experienced\
5:15\
anything so powerful!\
5:17\
Knowing I am a child of God\
is the most powerful knowledge\
5:21\
I possess!"\
5:22\
Seeking to know God, our Father.\
5:24\
Brothers and sisters,\
how can each of us\
5:26\
experience the power\
of understanding\
5:28\
our divine identity?\
5:31\
It begins by seeking to\
know God, our Father.\
5:35\
President Russell M. Nelson\
testified, "Something powerful\
5:40\
happens when a child of\
God seeks to know more\
5:42\
about Him and His Beloved Son."\
5:45\
Learning of and\
following the Savior\
5:47\
helps us come to\
know the Father.\
5:50\
"Being ... the express image"\
of His Father, Jesus taught,\
5:54\
"The Son can do\
nothing of himself,\
5:56\
but what he seeth\
the Father do."\
5:58\
Christ's every word and deed\
reveals the true nature of God\
6:03\
and our relationship to Him.\
6:05\
Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught,\
"With blood appearing at every\
6:11\
pore and an anguished\
cry upon His lips,\
6:15\
Christ sought Him whom He had\
always sought--His Father.\
6:20\
'Abba,' He cried, 'Papa.'"\
6:26\
As Jesus earnestly sought\
His Father in Gethsemane,\
6:29\
so young Joseph Smith,\
in 1820, prayerfully\
6:32\
sought God in the Sacred Grove.\
6:35\
After reading, "If any\
of you lack wisdom,\
6:38\
let him ask of God,"\
Joseph retired to pray.\
6:43\
"I kneeled down," he wrote,\
"and began to offer up\
6:46\
the desires of my heart to God.\
6:48\
...\
6:48\
"...\
6:49\
I saw a pillar of light\
exactly over my head. ...\
6:53\
"...\
6:53\
I saw two Personages,\
whose brightness and glory\
6:57\
defy all description,\
standing above me in the air.\
7:01\
One of them spake unto me,\
calling me by name and said,\
7:05\
pointing to the other--[Joseph,]\
This is My Beloved Son.\
7:10\
Hear Him!"\
7:13\
As we follow the examples of the\
Savior and the Prophet Joseph\
7:17\
in earnestly seeking God,\
we will come to understand\
7:21\
in a very real way, as Jen\
did, that our Father knows us\
7:25\
by name--that we\
are His children.\
7:28\
To young mothers who often\
feel overwhelmed and underwater\
7:33\
while striving to raise a\
"sin-resistant generation,"\
7:37\
never underestimate your\
central role in God's plan.\
7:41\
In stressful moments--perhaps\
when you are chasing little\
7:45\
ones and a charred smell from\
the kitchen informs you that\
7:48\
your lovingly prepared dinner is\
now a burnt offering--know that\
7:55\
God sanctifies your\
most difficult days.\
7:59\
"Fear thou not; for I am with\
thee," He peacefully reassures.\
8:04\
We honor you as you fulfill\
the hope of Sister Joy D.\
8:07\
Jones, who stated, "Our\
children deserve to understand\
8:11\
their divine identity."\
8:13\
I invite each of us to seek\
God and His Beloved Son.\
8:17\
"Nowhere," President\
Nelson said,\
8:19\
"are those truths taught\
more clearly and powerfully\
8:22\
than in the Book of Mormon."\
8:24\
Open its pages\
and learn that God\
8:27\
does "all things\
for [our] welfare\
8:29\
and happiness," that He\
is "merciful and gracious,\
8:32\
slow to anger, long-suffering\
and full of goodness,"\
8:36\
and that "all are\
alike unto [Him]."\
8:39\
When you feel hurt, lost,\
scared, upset, sad, hungry,\
8:43\
or hopelessly abandoned\
in life's extremities,\
8:47\
open the Book of Mormon, and you\
will come to know "[God] will\
8:51\
never desert us.\
8:53\
He never has, and He never will.\
8:55\
He cannot do it.\
8:57\
It is not His\
character [to do so]."\
9:01\
Coming to know our Father\
changes everything,\
9:04\
especially our hearts,\
as His gentle Spirit\
9:06\
confirms our true identity\
and great worth in His sight.\
9:10\
God walks with us\
along the covenant path\
9:14\
as we seek Him through\
prayerful pleadings,\
9:16\
scriptural searching,\
and obedient strivings.\
9:20\
The excellency of God's\
character--my witness.\
9:22\
I love Almighty God, who\
weeps with us in our sorrows,\
9:28\
patiently chastens\
our unrighteousness,\
9:30\
and rejoices when we seek\
to "give away all [our]\
9:34\
sins to know [Him]."\
9:36\
I worship Him, who is ever\
"a father of the fatherless"\
9:40\
and a companion to\
the companionless.\
9:42\
Gratefully, I\
testify that I have\
9:45\
come to know God,\
my Father, and bear\
9:50\
witness of the perfections,\
attributes, and "excellency\
9:53\
of [His] character."\
9:55\
That every one of us might\
truly understand and cherish\
9:59\
our "noble birthright"\
as a child of God\
10:01\
in coming to "know\
[Him] the only true God,\
10:05\
and Jesus Christ, whom [He has]\
sent," is my fervent prayer.\
10:09\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
