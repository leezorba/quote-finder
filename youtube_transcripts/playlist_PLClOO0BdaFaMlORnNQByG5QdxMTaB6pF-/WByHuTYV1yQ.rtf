My beloved brethren, thank\
you for your devotion\
0:05\
to the Lord and His holy work.\
0:07\
It is truly a joy\
to be with you.\
0:12\
As a new First Presidency, we\
thank you for your prayers,\
0:15\
for your sustaining efforts.\
0:18\
We are grateful for your\
lives and for your service\
0:22\
to the Lord.\
0:24\
Your devotion to duty\
and your selfless service\
0:27\
are just as important\
in your callings\
0:29\
as ours are in our callings.\
0:33\
Through a lifetime of\
service in this Church,\
0:35\
I have learned that\
it really doesn't\
0:37\
matter where one serves.\
0:39\
What the Lord cares\
about is how one serves.\
0:47\
I express deep gratitude for\
President Thomas S. Monson,\
0:51\
who was an example to me\
for more than 50 years,\
0:57\
and for his counselors,\
President Henry B.\
0:59\
Eyring and President\
Dieter F. Uchtdorf.\
1:04\
I express profound\
admiration for them.\
1:07\
I commend them for their service\
to the Lord and His prophets.\
1:12\
Both of these devoted servants\
have received new assignments.\
1:16\
They continue to serve\
with vigor and commitment.\
1:20\
I honor and love them both.\
1:25\
It is a remarkable\
blessing to serve\
1:27\
in the Lord's true and living\
Church with His authority\
1:30\
and power.\
1:31\
The restoration of\
the priesthood of God,\
1:35\
including the keys\
of the priesthood,\
1:38\
opens to worthy Latter-day\
Saints the greatest\
1:41\
of all spiritual blessings.\
1:44\
We see those blessings flowing\
to women, men, and children\
1:50\
throughout the world.\
1:53\
We see faithful women who\
understand the power inherent\
1:58\
in their callings and in\
their work in the endowment\
2:04\
and other temple ordinances.\
2:06\
These women know how to call\
upon the powers of heaven\
2:10\
to protect and strengthen their\
husbands, children, and others\
2:15\
they love.\
2:16\
These are spiritually\
strong women\
2:20\
who lead, teach, and minister\
fearlessly in their callings\
2:25\
with the power and\
authority of God!\
2:28\
How thankful I am for them!\
2:34\
Likewise, we see faithful men\
who live up to their privileges\
2:37\
as bearers of the priesthood.\
2:39\
They lead and serve by sacrifice\
in the Lord's way with love,\
2:44\
kindness, and patience.\
2:46\
They bless, guide, protect,\
and strengthen others\
2:51\
by the power of the\
priesthood they hold.\
2:55\
They bring miracles\
to those they\
2:57\
serve while they keep their own\
marriages and families safe.\
3:02\
They shun evil and are\
mighty elders in Israel.\
3:07\
I am most thankful for them!\
3:12\
Now, may I voice a concern?\
3:15\
It is this: Too many of\
our brothers and sisters\
3:21\
do not fully understand the\
concept of priesthood power\
3:24\
and authority.\
3:25\
They act as though they\
would rather satisfy\
3:28\
their own selfish\
desires and appetites\
3:32\
than use the power of God\
to bless His children.\
3:37\
I fear that too many of\
our brothers and sisters\
3:40\
do not grasp the privileges\
that could be theirs.\
3:45\
Some of our brethren,\
for example,\
3:46\
act like they do not understand\
what the priesthood is\
3:49\
and what it enables them to do.\
3:52\
Let me give you some\
specific examples.\
3:57\
Not long ago, I attended\
a sacrament meeting\
3:59\
in which a new baby\
was to be given\
4:01\
a name and a father's blessing.\
4:03\
The young father held his\
precious infant in his arms,\
4:08\
gave her a name, and then\
offered a beautiful prayer.\
4:16\
But he did not give\
that child a blessing.\
4:21\
That sweet baby girl got\
a name but no blessing!\
4:27\
That dear elder did not know\
the difference between a prayer\
4:30\
and a priesthood blessing.\
4:32\
With his priesthood\
authority and power,\
4:35\
he could have blessed his\
infant, but he did not.\
4:40\
I thought, "What a\
missed opportunity!"\
4:45\
Let me cite other examples.\
4:48\
We know of brethren who set\
sisters apart as Primary,\
4:52\
Young Women, or Relief Society\
leaders and teachers but fail\
4:56\
to bless them--to bless them\
with the power to fulfill\
5:01\
their callings.\
5:02\
They give only admonitions\
and instructions.\
5:08\
We see a worthy father\
who fails to give\
5:10\
his wife and his children\
priesthood blessings when\
5:13\
that is exactly what they need.\
5:16\
Priesthood power has been\
restored to this earth,\
5:19\
and yet far too many\
brothers and sisters\
5:23\
go through terrible trials,\
insatiable trials in life,\
5:29\
without ever receiving a\
true priesthood blessing.\
5:34\
What a tragedy!\
5:36\
That's a tragedy that\
we can eliminate.\
5:40\
Brethren, we hold the\
holy priesthood of God!\
5:42\
We have His authority\
to bless His people.\
5:46\
Just think of the\
remarkable assurance\
5:49\
the Lord gave us when He\
said, "Whomsoever you bless\
5:54\
I will bless."\
5:55\
It is our privilege to act\
in the name of Jesus Christ\
5:59\
to bless God's children\
according to His will for them.\
6:04\
Stake presidents and bishops,\
please ensure that every member\
6:08\
of the quorums within your\
stewardship understands how\
6:12\
to give a priesthood\
blessing--including\
6:16\
the personal worthiness and\
spiritual preparation required\
6:19\
to call fully upon\
the power of God.\
6:24\
To all brethren\
holding the priesthood,\
6:26\
I invite you to inspire members\
to keep their covenants,\
6:30\
fast and pray, study\
the scriptures,\
6:34\
worship in the temple,\
and serve with faith\
6:38\
as men and women of God.\
6:40\
We can help all to see\
with the eye of faith\
6:44\
that obedience and\
righteousness will draw them\
6:47\
closer to Jesus\
Christ, allow them\
6:50\
to enjoy the companionship\
of the Holy Ghost,\
6:53\
and experience joy in life!\
6:58\
A hallmark of the Lord's\
true and living Church\
7:00\
will always be an organized,\
directed effort to minister\
7:05\
to individual children of\
God and their families.\
7:09\
Because it is His Church,\
we as His servants\
7:13\
will minister to the\
one, just as He did.\
7:18\
We will minister in His name,\
with His power and authority,\
7:23\
and with His loving kindness.\
7:27\
An experience I had more\
than 60 years ago in Boston\
7:31\
taught me just how powerful\
the privilege of ministering\
7:35\
one-on-one can be.\
7:39\
I was then a resident surgeon\
at the Massachusetts General\
7:42\
Hospital--on duty every\
day, every other night,\
7:47\
and every other weekend.\
7:50\
I had limited time for my\
wife, our four children,\
7:55\
and Church activity.\
7:57\
Nonetheless, our\
branch president\
7:59\
assigned me to visit the home\
of Wilbur and Leonora Cox\
8:03\
with the hope that Brother\
Cox might come back\
8:06\
into activity in the Church.\
8:08\
He and Leonora had been\
sealed in the temple.\
8:11\
Yet Wilbur had not\
participated for many years.\
8:18\
My companion and I\
went to their home.\
8:21\
As we entered, Sister\
Cox welcomed us warmly,\
8:25\
but Brother Cox abruptly\
walked into another room\
8:29\
and closed the door.\
8:32\
I went to the closed\
door and knocked.\
8:37\
[LAUGHTER]\
8:41\
After a moment, I heard\
a muffled, "Come in."\
8:47\
I opened the door to\
find Brother Cox sitting\
8:50\
beside an array of\
amateur radio equipment.\
8:53\
In that small room,\
he lit up a cigar.\
8:58\
Clearly, my visit was\
not all that welcome.\
9:03\
I gazed about the\
room with wonderment\
9:05\
and said, "Brother\
Cox, I have always\
9:08\
wanted to learn more\
about amateur radio work.\
9:11\
Would you be willing\
to teach me about it?\
9:14\
I'm sorry I can't stay\
any longer tonight,\
9:17\
but could I come\
back another time?"\
9:22\
He hesitated for a moment\
and then said, "Yes."\
9:28\
That was the beginning of what\
became a wonderful friendship.\
9:32\
I returned and he taught me.\
9:36\
I began to love and respect him.\
9:39\
Through subsequent visits, the\
greatness of this man emerged.\
9:44\
We became very good\
friends, as did\
9:48\
our dear eternal companions.\
9:50\
Then, with the passage of\
time, our family moved away.\
9:55\
Local leaders continued\
to nurture the Cox family.\
10:01\
About eight years\
after that first visit,\
10:04\
the Boston Stake was created.\
10:09\
Can you guess who the\
first stake president was?\
10:14\
Yes!\
10:14\
Brother Cox!\
10:17\
During subsequent years, he also\
served as a mission president\
10:21\
and a temple president.\
10:26\
Years later, I, as a member\
of the Quorum of the Twelve,\
10:30\
was assigned to create a new\
stake in Sanpete County, Utah.\
10:34\
During the usual interviews,\
I was pleasantly surprised\
10:38\
to encounter again my\
dear friend Brother Cox!\
10:44\
I felt impressed to call him\
as the new stake patriarch.\
10:51\
After I ordained him, we\
embraced each other and wept.\
10:59\
People in the room were\
wondering why these two\
11:02\
grown men were crying.\
11:04\
[LAUGHTER]\
11:06\
But we knew.\
11:07\
And Sister Cox knew.\
11:09\
Ours were tears of joy!\
11:12\
We silently remembered\
the incredible journey\
11:16\
of love and repentance that\
began more than 30 years ago,\
11:20\
one night in their home.\
11:25\
The account doesn't end there.\
11:27\
Brother and Sister\
Cox's family grew\
11:29\
to include 3 children,\
20 grandchildren, and 54\
11:34\
great-grandchildren.\
11:36\
Add to that their impact on\
hundreds of missionaries,\
11:40\
on thousands more in the\
temple, and on hundreds more\
11:43\
who received\
patriarchal blessings\
11:45\
at the hands of Wilbur Cox.\
11:47\
His and Leonora's influence\
will continue to ripple\
11:51\
through many generations\
throughout the world.\
11:56\
Experiences such as this with\
Wilbur and Leonora Cox occur\
12:01\
every week--hopefully, every\
day--within this Church.\
12:07\
Dedicated servants of\
the Lord Jesus Christ\
12:10\
carry out His work with\
His power and authority.\
12:17\
Brethren, there are\
doors we can open,\
12:19\
priesthood blessings we can\
give, hearts we can heal,\
12:23\
burdens we can lift,\
testimonies we can strengthen,\
12:27\
lives we can save, and joy\
we can bring into the homes\
12:32\
of the Latter-day Saints--all\
because we hold the priesthood\
12:35\
of God.\
12:38\
We are the men who have\
been "called and prepared\
12:41\
from the foundation\
of the world according\
12:43\
to the foreknowledge of God,\
on account of [our] exceeding\
12:47\
faith," to do this work.\
12:52\
Tonight I invite you\
literally to rise up\
12:56\
with me in our great\
eternal brotherhood.\
13:01\
When I name your\
priesthood office,\
13:04\
please stand and\
remain standing.\
13:08\
Deacons, please arise!\
13:15\
Teachers, arise!\
13:20\
Priests!\
13:25\
Bishops!\
13:30\
Elders!\
13:35\
High priests!\
13:38\
Patriarchs!\
13:42\
Seventies!\
13:45\
Apostles!\
13:49\
Now, brethren, will you\
please remain standing\
13:52\
and join with our chorus\
in singing all three verses\
13:55\
of "Rise Up, O Men of God"?\
13:59\
While you sing,\
think of your duty\
14:02\
as God's mighty\
army to help prepare\
14:05\
the world for the Second\
Coming of the Lord.\
14:08\
This is our charge.\
14:10\
This is our privilege.\
14:12\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
