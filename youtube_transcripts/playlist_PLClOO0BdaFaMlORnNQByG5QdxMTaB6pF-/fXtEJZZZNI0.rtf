My Brothers and\
sisters, we have just\
0:04\
participated in a solemn\
assembly, a practice that\
0:09\
can be traced back to the Bible\
when ancient Israel gathered\
0:14\
to feel the Lord's presence\
and celebrate His blessings.\
0:18\
We are privileged\
to live in a time\
0:21\
when this ancient\
practice has been\
0:23\
restored through the\
Prophet Joseph Smith.\
0:26\
I urge you to record in\
your personal journal what\
0:31\
you felt regarding this most\
sacred occasion in which you\
0:35\
have taken part.\
0:37\
Recently we said goodbye to\
our dear friend and prophet,\
0:41\
President Thomas S. Monson.\
0:44\
Although we all miss\
him, we are deeply\
0:48\
grateful the Lord has called a\
new prophet, President Russell\
0:52\
M. Nelson, to preside\
over His Church.\
0:56\
In an orderly way we have\
now begun a new chapter\
1:02\
in our Church history.\
1:04\
This is a precious\
gift from God.\
1:09\
As we each sustained President\
Nelson by our uplifted hands,\
1:15\
we stood as witnesses\
before God and acknowledged\
1:20\
that he is President\
Monson's rightful successor.\
1:25\
With our raised hands we\
promised to hearken unto\
1:29\
his voice as he receives\
direction from the Lord.\
1:36\
THE LORD HAS SAID: "Thou shalt\
give heed unto all his [meaning\
1:41\
the President of the Church]\
words and commandments which he\
1:46\
shall give unto you as\
he receiveth them ... ;\
1:52\
"For his word ye shall receive,\
as if from mine own mouth,\
1:57\
in all patience and faith."\
2:01\
I have known our new\
prophet-president\
2:04\
for over 60 years.\
2:06\
I have served with him in the\
Quorum of the Twelve for 33\
2:11\
years, and I am a witness\
that the hand of the Lord\
2:16\
has been preparing him to\
become our presiding apostle\
2:21\
and prophet to administer all\
the keys of the holy priesthood\
2:26\
on the earth.\
2:28\
May each one of us completely\
sustain him and his counselors\
2:34\
and follow their direction.\
2:36\
We also warmly welcome\
Elder Gong and Elder Soares\
2:41\
as members of the Quorum\
of the Twelve Apostles.\
2:46\
After Jesus's\
Resurrection, an event\
2:50\
we celebrate this\
glorious Easter weekend,\
2:54\
He appeared to His disciples\
and said, "Peace be unto you:\
3:00\
as my Father hath sent\
me, even so send I you."\
3:07\
Notice a twofold action:\
God sends His Son.\
3:12\
The Son sends His\
servants--mortal men\
3:15\
and women--to\
accomplish Their work.\
3:19\
We should not be\
surprised to know\
3:22\
that those individuals\
called to do the Lord's work\
3:25\
are not humanly perfect.\
3:27\
Stories in the scriptures detail\
incidents about men and women\
3:32\
who were called of God to\
accomplish a great work--good\
3:35\
sons and daughters of our\
Heavenly Father called to serve\
3:39\
in their assignments\
in the Church,\
3:42\
striving to do their best,\
but none of them yet perfect.\
3:47\
The same is true of us.\
3:51\
Given the reality of our human\
weaknesses and shortcomings,\
3:55\
how do we move forward in\
supporting and sustaining\
3:59\
each other?\
4:00\
It begins with faith--real,\
sincere faith in the Lord Jesus\
4:07\
Christ.\
4:08\
Faith in the Savior is the\
first principle of the doctrine\
4:13\
and gospel of Christ.\
4:16\
Several years ago I was\
visiting the Holy Land.\
4:19\
As we drove by a mustard\
plant, the director\
4:23\
of the BYU Jerusalem\
Center asked if I had ever\
4:27\
seen a mustard seed.\
4:30\
I hadn't, so we stopped.\
4:33\
He showed me the seeds\
from the mustard plant.\
4:37\
They were surprisingly small.\
4:40\
I then remembered\
Jesus's teachings:\
4:43\
"For verily I say unto\
you, If ye have faith\
4:48\
as a grain of mustard seed, ye\
shall say unto this mountain,\
4:53\
Remove hence to yonder\
place; and it shall remove;\
4:59\
and nothing shall be\
impossible unto you."\
5:03\
If we have faith as\
small as a mustard seed,\
5:07\
the Lord can help us remove\
the mountains of discouragement\
5:12\
and doubt in the\
tasks ahead of us\
5:15\
as we serve with God's children,\
including family members,\
5:21\
Church members, and\
those who are not yet\
5:24\
members of the Church.\
5:26\
Brothers and sisters, life\
can be filled with faith, joy,\
5:32\
happiness, hope, and love when\
we exercise the smallest amount\
5:37\
of real faith in Christ--even\
a mustard seed of faith.\
5:44\
Elder George A. Smith remembered\
some advice the Prophet Joseph\
5:49\
Smith gave him: "He told me I\
should never get discouraged,\
5:55\
whatever difficulties\
might surround me.\
5:58\
If I was sunk in the\
lowest pit of Nova Scotia\
6:02\
and all the Rocky Mountains\
piled on top of me,\
6:07\
I ought not to be discouraged\
but hang on, exercise faith,\
6:13\
and keep up good courage\
and I should come out\
6:17\
on the top of the heap at last."\
6:21\
We should remember\
Paul's declaration:\
6:24\
"I can do all things through\
Christ which strengtheneth me."\
6:29\
Knowing this is another\
precious gift from God.\
6:34\
In addition to the gifts I have\
mentioned, there are many more.\
6:38\
I speak now of just a few:\
the gift of the Sabbath day,\
6:43\
the sacrament,\
service to others,\
6:47\
and the matchless gift\
from God of our Savior.\
6:52\
The power of the Sabbath\
day is to experience\
6:55\
in Church and at home\
the delight, the joy,\
6:59\
and the warmth of feeling\
the Spirit of the Lord\
7:02\
without any kind of distraction.\
7:07\
Too many allow themselves\
to almost live online with\
7:11\
their smart devices--screens\
illuminating their faces day\
7:17\
and night and earplugs in their\
ears blocking out the still,\
7:21\
small voice of the Spirit.\
7:24\
If we do not find\
time to unplug,\
7:28\
we may miss opportunities to\
hear the voice of Him who said,\
7:33\
"Be still, and know\
that I am God."\
7:38\
Now, there is nothing\
wrong with taking advantage\
7:41\
of the advances in the\
technologies inspired\
7:44\
by the Lord, but we must\
be wise in their use.\
7:48\
Remember the gift\
of the Sabbath day.\
7:53\
The blessing of\
receiving the sacrament\
7:57\
must never become\
routine or just something\
8:01\
we do in sacrament meeting.\
8:04\
It is only 70 minutes\
in a whole week\
8:08\
when we can pause and find\
more peace, joy, and happiness\
8:13\
in our lives.\
8:15\
Partaking of the sacrament\
and renewing our covenants\
8:19\
is a sign by us to the Lord\
that we do always remember Him.\
8:25\
His Atonement is a\
gracious gift from God.\
8:31\
The privilege of service to\
Heavenly Father's children\
8:35\
is an opportunity to follow\
the example of His Beloved Son\
8:40\
by serving one another.\
8:43\
Some service opportunities\
are formal--in our family,\
8:47\
our Church callings, and our\
participation in community\
8:51\
service organizations.\
8:53\
Church members--both men and\
women--should not hesitate,\
8:57\
if they desire, to run for\
public office at any level\
9:02\
of government\
wherever they live.\
9:04\
Our voices are essential today\
and important in our schools,\
9:10\
our cities, and our countries.\
9:13\
Where democracy\
exists, it is our duty\
9:17\
as members to vote for\
honorable men and women who\
9:22\
are willing to serve.\
9:25\
Many opportunities to\
serve are informal--without\
9:28\
assignment--and come as we\
reach out to others we meet\
9:33\
in life's journey.\
9:34\
Remember, Jesus\
taught the lawyer\
9:38\
that we should love\
God and our neighbor\
9:41\
as ourselves, using the Good\
Samaritan as an example.\
9:47\
Service opens a window by\
which we understand the life\
9:51\
and ministry of Christ.\
9:53\
He came to serve,\
as the scriptures\
9:56\
teach, "even as\
the Son of man came\
10:01\
not to be ministered\
unto, but to minister,\
10:04\
and to give his life\
a ransom for many."\
10:09\
Peter may have given the best\
description of the Savior's\
10:13\
mortal ministry in five words\
when he referred to Jesus,\
10:18\
"who went about doing good."\
10:20\
The Lord Jesus Christ\
is our most precious\
10:25\
of all gifts from God.\
10:27\
Jesus said, "I am the way,\
the truth, and the life:\
10:32\
no man cometh unto the\
Father, but by me."\
10:37\
Nephi captured the\
importance of our Savior\
10:41\
when he declared, "We talk of\
Christ, we rejoice in Christ,\
10:46\
we preach of Christ,\
we prophesy of Christ,\
10:51\
and we write according\
to our prophecies,\
10:54\
that our children may know\
to what source they may look\
10:59\
for a remission of their sins."\
11:02\
We must keep Christ as\
the center of our lives\
11:07\
at all times and in all places.\
11:12\
We should remember that\
it is His name that\
11:15\
appears on our\
places of worship,\
11:18\
we are baptized in\
His name, and we\
11:21\
are confirmed, ordained,\
endowed, and sealed\
11:24\
in marriage in His name.\
11:27\
We partake of the sacrament and\
promise to take upon ourselves\
11:33\
His name--and become\
true Christians.\
11:36\
Finally, we are asked in\
the sacramental prayer\
11:40\
to "always remember him."\
11:44\
As we prepare for Easter\
Sunday tomorrow, let\
11:48\
us remember that\
Christ is supreme.\
11:51\
He is the righteous Judge,\
our faithful Advocate,\
11:56\
blessed Redeemer, Good Shepherd,\
promised Messiah, true Friend,\
12:05\
and much, much more.\
12:08\
He is indeed a very precious\
gift to us from the Father.\
12:15\
In our discipleship, we\
have many demands, concerns,\
12:21\
and assignments.\
12:22\
However, some\
activities must always\
12:25\
be at the heart of\
our Church membership.\
12:28\
"Wherefore," the Lord\
commands, "be faithful;\
12:32\
stand in the office which\
I have appointed unto you;\
12:36\
succor the weak, lift up\
the hands which hang down,\
12:40\
and strengthen\
the feeble knees."\
12:43\
This is the Church in action!\
12:45\
This is pure religion!\
12:47\
This is the gospel\
in its true sense\
12:51\
as we succor, lift,\
and strengthen those\
12:55\
in spiritual and temporal need!\
12:58\
Doing so requires\
us to visit them\
13:01\
and to assist them that\
their testimonies of faith\
13:05\
in Heavenly Father and Jesus\
Christ and His Atonement\
13:09\
will be anchored\
in their hearts.\
13:13\
May the Lord help and bless\
us to treasure our membership\
13:23\
in His restored Church.\
13:25\
I pray we will be\
filled with love\
13:28\
for all of Heavenly\
Father's children\
13:31\
and be able to see their\
needs and be willing to answer\
13:35\
their questions and\
concerns about the gospel\
13:38\
in clear and kind ways that\
will increase understanding\
13:44\
and appreciation\
for one another.\
13:47\
I testify that Jesus\
Christ is our Savior.\
13:51\
What we will be taught at\
this general conference\
13:55\
comes to us by inspiration\
from apostles and prophets,\
13:59\
from General Authorities\
and sister leaders who are\
14:03\
General Officers of the Church.\
14:05\
May the joy and peace of\
the Lord abide with each one\
14:10\
is my humble prayer in the name\
of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
