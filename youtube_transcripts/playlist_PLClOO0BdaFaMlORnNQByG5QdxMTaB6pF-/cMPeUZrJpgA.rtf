I have fervently prayed\
that the Holy Ghost\
0:03\
will be with each of us today\
on this heavenly occasion.\
0:07\
What we have\
collectively witnessed\
0:09\
has been most impressive\
as the 17th prophet\
0:13\
of this dispensation has been\
sustained in solemn assembly.\
0:17\
As I sought guidance to know\
the topic the Lord would have\
0:20\
me address today,\
my mind was directed\
0:23\
to a recent conversation\
with the newly called First\
0:25\
Presidency.\
0:26\
In this discussion,\
one of the counselors\
0:28\
shared words to this\
effect: "I deeply\
0:31\
hope that the\
membership of the Church\
0:33\
can comprehend the magnitude\
of what has taken place\
0:37\
with the calling of our new\
prophet, President Russell M.\
0:40\
Nelson, and the significance\
and sacredness of the solemn\
0:43\
assembly that will take\
place at general conference."\
0:47\
He further observed,\
"It has been 10 years,\
0:51\
and many, especially the youth\
of the Church, do not remember\
0:55\
or have not experienced\
this before."\
0:59\
This caused me to reflect\
on experiences I have had.\
1:03\
The first prophet I remember\
is President David O. McKay.\
1:07\
I was 14 years old\
when he passed away.\
1:11\
I remember a sense of\
loss that accompanied\
1:14\
his passing, the tears\
in my mother's eyes,\
1:17\
and the sorrow felt\
by our whole family.\
1:19\
I remember how the words "Please\
bless President David O. McKay"\
1:24\
fell out of my lips so\
naturally in my prayers\
1:26\
that if I wasn't mindful,\
even following his passing,\
1:30\
I would find myself using\
to those same words.\
1:34\
I wondered if my mind and\
heart would transition\
1:37\
to the same feeling and\
conviction for the prophets\
1:40\
succeeding him.\
1:41\
But almost like parents who\
love each of their children,\
1:44\
I found a love for,\
connection with,\
1:47\
and testimony of President\
Joseph Fielding Smith, who\
1:51\
followed President McKay, and\
for each prophet thereafter:\
1:55\
Harold B. Lee, Spencer W.\
Kimball, Ezra Taft Benson,\
1:59\
Howard W. Hunter, Gordon B.\
Hinckley, Thomas S. Monson,\
2:03\
and today President\
Russell M. Nelson.\
2:07\
I fully sustained each prophet\
with uplifted hand--and\
2:11\
uplifted heart.\
2:13\
As each of our beloved\
prophets have passed on,\
2:15\
it is only natural to feel\
a sense of sorrow and loss.\
2:19\
But our sadness is tempered\
by the joy and hope that\
2:22\
comes as we experience\
one of the great blessings\
2:26\
of the Restoration: the calling\
and sustaining of a living\
2:30\
prophet on the earth.\
2:32\
To that end, I will speak to\
this divine process as observed\
2:36\
over the past 90 days.\
2:38\
I will describe it in\
four segments: first,\
2:41\
the passing of our prophet\
and the dissolution\
2:44\
of the First Presidency; second,\
the period of time awaiting\
2:47\
the reorganization of\
the new First Presidency;\
2:50\
third, the calling\
of the new prophet;\
2:53\
and fourth, the sustaining\
of the new prophet\
2:56\
and First Presidency\
in solemn assembly.\
2:59\
The passing of a prophet.\
3:01\
On January 2, 2018, our dear\
prophet Thomas S. Monson\
3:06\
passed to the other\
side of the veil.\
3:08\
He will forever have\
a place in our hearts.\
3:11\
President Henry B. Eyring\
offered sentiments at President\
3:15\
Monson's passing which\
succinctly describe\
3:18\
our feelings: "The\
hallmark of his life,\
3:21\
like the Savior's, will be his\
individual concern in reaching\
3:25\
out to the poor, the sick--even\
all individuals--worldwide."\
3:31\
President Spencer W.\
Kimball explained:\
3:34\
"As one star sinks\
behind the horizon,\
3:37\
another comes into the\
picture, and death spawns life.\
3:41\
"The work of the\
Lord is endless.\
3:43\
Even when a powerful leader\
dies, not for a single instant\
3:46\
is the Church without\
leadership, thanks to the kind\
3:50\
Providence who gave his kingdom\
continuity and perpetuity.\
3:55\
As it already has happened ...\
before in this dispensation,\
3:58\
a people reverently close\
a grave, dry their tears,\
4:03\
and turn their faces\
to the future."\
4:06\
The apostolic interregnum.\
4:08\
The period of time between\
the death of a prophet\
4:11\
and the reorganization\
of the First Presidency\
4:14\
is referred to as an\
"apostolic interregnum."\
4:17\
During this period, the\
Quorum of the Twelve,\
4:20\
under the leadership of\
the quorum president,\
4:23\
jointly holds the\
keys to administer\
4:25\
the leadership of the Church.\
4:27\
President Joseph F. Smith\
taught, "There is always\
4:31\
a head in the Church, and if\
the Presidency of the Church\
4:33\
are removed by death\
or other cause,\
4:36\
then the next head\
of the Church is\
4:39\
the Twelve Apostles, until a\
presidency is again organized."\
4:44\
The most recent\
interregnum period\
4:46\
began when President Monson\
passed away on January 2\
4:50\
and ended 12 days later,\
on Sunday, January 14.\
4:54\
On that Sabbath morning,\
the Quorum of the Twelve\
4:57\
met in the upper room\
of the Salt Lake Temple\
5:00\
in a spirit of\
fasting and prayer,\
5:02\
under the presiding direction\
of President Russell M.\
5:05\
Nelson, the senior\
Apostle and President\
5:08\
of the Quorum of the Twelve.\
5:09\
Calling of a new prophet.\
5:11\
In this sacred and\
memorable meeting,\
5:14\
following a\
well-established precedent\
5:16\
in unity and\
unanimity, the Brethren\
5:18\
were seated by seniority in\
a semicircle of 13 chairs\
5:23\
and raised their\
hands first to sustain\
5:27\
the organization of\
a First Presidency\
5:29\
and then to sustain\
President Russell Marion\
5:32\
Nelson as President\
of The Church of Jesus\
5:36\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
5:37\
This sustaining was followed\
by the Quorum of the Twelve\
5:42\
gathering in a circle\
and placing hands\
5:44\
upon the head of\
President Nelson\
5:47\
to ordain and set him apart,\
with the next most-senior\
5:51\
Apostle acting as voice.\
5:54\
President Nelson then named his\
counselors, President Dallin\
5:58\
Harris Oaks, President\
Henry Bennion Eyring,\
6:01\
with President Oaks\
as the President\
6:04\
of the Quorum of the Twelve\
Apostles and President Melvin\
6:08\
Russell Ballard as the Acting\
President of the Quorum\
6:11\
of the Twelve Apostles.\
6:12\
Following similar sustaining\
votes, each of these Brethren\
6:16\
were set apart to their\
respective offices\
6:19\
by President Nelson.\
6:21\
This was a deeply\
sacred experience,\
6:25\
with an outpouring\
of the Spirit.\
6:28\
I offer to you my\
absolute witness\
6:30\
that the will of the Lord,\
for which we fervently prayed,\
6:34\
was powerfully manifest\
in the activities\
6:38\
and events of that day.\
6:40\
With the ordination\
of President Nelson\
6:42\
and the reorganization\
of the First Presidency,\
6:44\
the apostolic interregnum ended\
and the newly constituted First\
6:50\
Presidency began to operate\
without, remarkably, even one\
6:56\
second of interruption\
in governing the Lord's\
6:59\
kingdom on the earth.\
7:00\
Solemn assembly.\
7:02\
This morning, this divine\
process is culminated\
7:06\
in accordance with\
scriptural mandate outlined\
7:09\
in the Doctrine and Covenants:\
"For all things must be done\
7:13\
in order, and by common\
consent in the church,\
7:15\
by the prayer of faith," and\
"three Presiding High Priests,\
7:20\
... upheld by the\
confidence, faith,\
7:22\
and prayer of the church, form\
a quorum of the Presidency\
7:25\
of the Church."\
7:28\
Elder David B. Haight\
described a previous occurrence\
7:30\
of what we\
participated in today:\
7:34\
"We are witnesses to and\
participants in a most sacred\
7:37\
occasion--a solemn assembly\
to act upon heavenly things.\
7:42\
As in olden times, there has\
been much fasting and prayer\
7:45\
offered by the Saints throughout\
the world that they may receive\
7:48\
an outpouring of the\
Spirit of the Lord,\
7:50\
which is so much in evidence ...\
on this occasion this morning.\
7:55\
"A solemn assembly,\
as the name implies,\
7:57\
denotes a sacred, sober,\
and reverent occasion\
8:01\
when the Saints assemble under\
the direction of the First\
8:04\
Presidency."\
8:07\
Brothers and sisters, we\
can rejoice--even shout,\
8:10\
"Hosanna!"--that the Lord's\
mouthpiece, a prophet of God,\
8:13\
is in place and that the Lord is\
pleased that His work is being\
8:18\
done in the way that He\
has divinely prescribed.\
8:21\
President Russell M. Nelson.\
8:23\
This divinely ordained process\
leads to another divinely\
8:26\
called prophet.\
8:27\
Just as President Monson was\
one of the grandest inhabitants\
8:31\
to grace this earth,\
so is President Nelson.\
8:33\
He has been profoundly prepared\
and specifically tutored\
8:37\
by the Lord to lead\
us at this time.\
8:39\
It is a great blessing to now\
have dear President Russell M.\
8:43\
Nelson as our loving and devoted\
prophet--the 17th President\
8:47\
of the Church in this\
final dispensation.\
8:51\
President Nelson is\
truly a remarkable man.\
8:54\
I had the privilege of serving\
in the Quorum of the Twelve\
8:57\
with him as my quorum president\
for just over two years.\
9:02\
I have traveled with him\
and marvel at his energy,\
9:05\
as one must move quickly\
to keep up with his pace!\
9:09\
In total, he has visited 133\
countries in his lifetime.\
9:14\
His outreach is to\
all, young and old.\
9:16\
He seems to know everyone\
and is particularly\
9:19\
gifted at remembering names.\
9:22\
All who know him feel that\
they are his favorite.\
9:26\
And so it is with each of\
us--because of his genuine love\
9:29\
and concern for everyone.\
9:32\
My primary association\
with President Nelson\
9:34\
has been in\
ecclesiastical roles,\
9:36\
yet I have also become familiar\
with the professional life\
9:40\
that President Nelson\
led before he was\
9:42\
called as a General Authority.\
9:44\
As many of you know,\
President Nelson\
9:46\
was a world-renowned\
heart surgeon\
9:48\
and, early in his\
medical career,\
9:50\
a pioneer developer of\
the heart-lung machine.\
9:53\
He was on the research\
team that supported\
9:56\
the first open-heart\
operation on a human being,\
9:58\
in 1951, using a\
heart-lung bypass.\
10:03\
President Nelson performed\
a heart operation\
10:06\
on President Spencer\
W. Kimball not long\
10:10\
before President Kimball\
became the prophet.\
10:13\
Interestingly, as President\
Nelson's call to the Twelve\
10:17\
34 years ago ended a\
professional medical career\
10:22\
of strengthening and\
repairing hearts,\
10:25\
it began a ministry\
as an Apostle devoted\
10:29\
to strengthening\
and repairing hearts\
10:34\
of countless tens of\
thousands around the world,\
10:37\
each having been\
lifted and healed\
10:39\
by his words and acts of\
wisdom, service, and love.\
10:43\
A Christlike heart.\
10:45\
When I envision a Christlike\
heart in daily practice,\
10:48\
I see President Nelson.\
10:50\
I have not met anyone who\
exemplifies this trait\
10:53\
at a higher level than him.\
10:54\
It has been a remarkable\
tutelage for me\
10:57\
to be in the position\
to observe firsthand\
11:01\
the manifestations of the\
Christlike heart of President\
11:04\
Nelson.\
11:06\
Within weeks of my call to\
the Twelve in October 2015,\
11:10\
I had the opportunity to\
get an up-close glimpse\
11:13\
of the past professional\
life of President Nelson.\
11:17\
I was invited to\
attend an event where\
11:19\
he received the\
Cardiothoracic Surgery Award.\
11:24\
When I entered the\
venue, I was astonished\
11:26\
to see the large\
number of professionals\
11:29\
there to honor and recognize the\
work that President Nelson had\
11:33\
done many years before as a\
medical doctor and surgeon.\
11:37\
That evening,\
numerous professionals\
11:40\
expressed their\
respect and admiration\
11:42\
for President Nelson's\
outstanding contribution\
11:46\
to his medical specialty.\
11:50\
As impressive as each\
of the presenters\
11:53\
was in describing\
President Nelson's\
11:56\
various accomplishments,\
I was even more\
11:59\
spellbound by a\
conversation I struck\
12:02\
up with a man seated next to me.\
12:05\
He did not know who I was,\
but he knew President Nelson\
12:09\
as Dr. Nelson, director of\
the thoracic surgery residency\
12:15\
program at a medical\
school in 1955.\
12:20\
This man was President\
Nelson's former student.\
12:23\
He shared many memories.\
12:25\
Most interesting\
was his description\
12:27\
of President Nelson's teaching\
style, which, he said,\
12:31\
brought with it a large\
measure of notoriety.\
12:34\
He explained that much of\
the teaching of heart surgery\
12:37\
residents was conducted\
in the operating room.\
12:40\
There, residents observed\
and performed surgery\
12:43\
under faculty supervision,\
as a laboratory classroom.\
12:47\
He shared that the\
operating room environment\
12:50\
under certain faculty\
surgeons was chaotic,\
12:53\
competitive, pressure\
filled, and even ego driven.\
12:57\
This man described it as\
a difficult environment,\
13:00\
sometimes even demeaning.\
13:02\
As a result, resident\
surgeons even\
13:04\
felt their careers\
were often on the line.\
13:08\
He then explained the\
unique environment\
13:09\
found in President\
Nelson's operating room.\
13:11\
It was peaceful,\
calm, and dignified.\
13:15\
Residents were treated\
with deep respect.\
13:18\
However, following the\
demonstration of a procedure,\
13:21\
Dr. Nelson expected the\
highest standard of performance\
13:24\
from each of the residents.\
13:27\
This man further described\
how the best patient outcomes\
13:30\
and the best surgeons came out\
of Dr. Nelson's operating room.\
13:34\
This is no surprise\
to me at all.\
13:35\
This is what I have\
observed firsthand and been\
13:38\
truly blessed by in the\
Quorum of the Twelve.\
13:41\
I feel like I have\
been, in a sense,\
13:43\
one of his "residents\
in training."\
13:45\
President Nelson has\
an exceptional way\
13:47\
of teaching others and\
offering correction\
13:50\
in a positive, respectful,\
and uplifting manner.\
13:53\
He is the embodiment\
of a Christlike heart\
13:56\
and an example to us all.\
13:58\
From him, we learn that in any\
circumstance we find ourselves,\
14:02\
our conduct and hearts\
can be in accordance\
14:05\
with the principles of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
14:08\
We now have the great blessing\
to sustain our prophet,\
14:11\
President Russell M. Nelson.\
14:13\
Throughout his life, he has\
magnified his numerous roles\
14:16\
as student, father,\
professor, husband, doctor,\
14:20\
priesthood leader,\
grandfather, and Apostle.\
14:24\
He fulfilled these roles\
then--and continues to do\
14:27\
so--with the heart of a prophet.\
14:31\
Brothers and sisters, what we\
have witnessed and participated\
14:34\
in today, a solemn assembly,\
leads to my witness\
14:38\
that President Russell M.\
Nelson is the Lord's living\
14:42\
mouthpiece for all humankind.\
14:44\
I also add my testimony of God\
the Father, of Jesus Christ,\
14:49\
and of His role as our\
Savior and Redeemer.\
14:52\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
