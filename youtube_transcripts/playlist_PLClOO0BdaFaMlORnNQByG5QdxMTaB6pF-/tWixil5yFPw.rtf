"Now upon the first\
day of the week,\
0:03\
very early in the morning,\
they came unto the sepulchre,\
0:08\
bringing the spices\
which they had prepared,\
0:11\
and certain others with them.\
0:14\
"And they found the stone\
rolled away from the sepulchre.\
0:18\
"And they entered in, and found\
not the body of the Lord Jesus.\
0:25\
"And it came to pass, as they\
were much perplexed thereabout,\
0:28\
behold, two men stood by\
them in shining garments:\
0:34\
"And as they were afraid,\
and bowed down their faces\
0:36\
to the earth, they\
said unto them,\
0:39\
Why seek ye the\
living among the dead?\
0:45\
"He is not here, but is risen."\
0:50\
Tomorrow, the Easter Sabbath, we\
will remember in a special way\
0:55\
what Jesus Christ\
has done for us:\
0:58\
"For God so loved the world,\
that he gave his only begotten\
1:03\
Son, that whosoever believeth in\
him should not perish, but have\
1:09\
everlasting life."\
1:11\
Eventually we will be\
resurrected, as He was,\
1:16\
to live forever.\
1:19\
Through the miracle of\
the sacred Atonement\
1:21\
of Jesus Christ, we can also\
receive the gift of forgiveness\
1:26\
of our sins and\
misdeeds if we accept\
1:32\
the opportunity and\
responsibility of repentance.\
1:38\
And by receiving\
necessary ordinances,\
1:41\
keeping covenants, and\
obeying commandments,\
1:45\
we can gain eternal\
life and exaltation.\
1:51\
Today I want to\
focus on forgiveness,\
1:53\
an essential and precious gift\
offered to us from our Savior\
1:58\
and Redeemer, Jesus Christ.\
2:02\
On a December night in\
1982, my wife, Terry, and I\
2:08\
were awakened by a phone call\
to our home in Pocatello, Idaho.\
2:14\
As I answered the phone,\
I heard only sobbing.\
2:19\
Finally my sister's struggling\
voice said, "Tommy is dead."\
2:26\
A 20-year-old drunk driver,\
speeding at more than 85 miles\
2:36\
per hour, recklessly\
ran a stoplight\
2:39\
in a suburb of Denver, Colorado.\
2:44\
He crashed violently\
into the car driven\
2:47\
by my youngest brother,\
Tommy, instantly killing him\
2:51\
and his wife, Joan.\
2:54\
They were returning\
home to a young daughter\
2:58\
after a Christmas party.\
3:03\
My wife and I immediately\
flew to Denver\
3:06\
and made our way\
to the mortuary.\
3:09\
We gathered with my\
parents and siblings\
3:13\
and grieved the loss of\
our beloved Tommy and Joan.\
3:17\
We had lost them to a\
senseless criminal act.\
3:22\
Our hearts were broken, and\
anger toward the young offender\
3:27\
began to well up inside me.\
3:30\
Tommy had served as a\
lawyer in the United States\
3:34\
Department of Justice\
and was on a course\
3:37\
to be a strong\
advocate for protection\
3:39\
of Native American lands and\
natural resources for years\
3:46\
to come.\
3:48\
After some time had passed,\
a court sentencing hearing\
3:52\
was held for the young\
man found responsible\
3:55\
for vehicular manslaughter.\
3:58\
In their ongoing\
grief and sorrow,\
4:01\
my parents and oldest sister,\
Katy, attended the hearing.\
4:05\
The drunk driver's\
parents were also there,\
4:09\
and after the hearing concluded,\
they sat on a bench and wept.\
4:15\
My parents and sister\
were sitting nearby\
4:19\
as they sought to gain\
control of their own emotions.\
4:23\
After a moment, my\
parents and sister\
4:27\
stood up and walked to\
the driver's parents\
4:32\
and offered them words of\
comfort and forgiveness.\
4:38\
The men shook hands;\
the women held hands;\
4:43\
there was deep sorrow and\
tears for all and recognition\
4:48\
that both families had\
suffered immensely.\
4:52\
Mom, Dad, and Katy led the\
way with their quiet strength\
5:00\
and courage and\
showed our family\
5:03\
what forgiveness looks like.\
5:08\
That outreach of\
forgiveness in those moments\
5:11\
caused my own heart to\
soften and opened a pathway\
5:15\
to healing.\
5:16\
Over time I learned how\
to have a forgiving heart.\
5:21\
Only with the help of\
the Prince of Peace\
5:25\
was my painful burden lifted.\
5:29\
My heart will always\
miss Tommy and Joan,\
5:33\
but forgiveness now\
allows me to remember them\
5:36\
with unfettered joy.\
5:39\
And I know we will be\
together again as a family.\
5:45\
I am not suggesting that we\
condone unlawful conduct.\
5:50\
We know full well\
that individuals\
5:52\
are to be held accountable\
for their criminal acts\
5:55\
and civil wrongdoings.\
5:57\
However, we also know that as\
sons and daughters of God who\
6:03\
follow the teachings\
of Jesus Christ,\
6:06\
we are to be forgiving even\
when it seems others may not\
6:12\
warrant our forgiveness.\
6:15\
THE SAVIOR TAUGHT: "For if ye\
forgive men their trespasses,\
6:20\
your heavenly Father\
will also forgive you:\
6:24\
"But if ye forgive not\
men their trespasses,\
6:27\
neither will your Father\
forgive your trespasses."\
6:32\
We can all receive unspeakable\
peace and partnering\
6:36\
with our Savior as we learn\
to freely forgive those\
6:40\
who have trespassed against us.\
6:43\
This partnering brings the\
Savior's power into our lives\
6:48\
in an unmistakable and\
never-to-be-forgotten way.\
6:55\
THE APOSTLE PAUL COUNSELED:\
"Put on therefore,\
6:58\
as the elect of God, ...\
7:01\
bowels of mercies, kindness,\
humbleness of mind,\
7:07\
meekness, longsuffering;\
7:10\
"Forbearing one another, and\
forgiving one another ... :\
7:14\
even as Christ forgave\
you, so also do ye."\
7:23\
THE LORD HIMSELF DECLARED:\
"Wherefore, I say unto you,\
7:27\
that ye ought to forgive one\
another; for he that forgiveth\
7:32\
not his brother his\
trespasses standeth condemned\
7:37\
before the Lord; for\
there remaineth in him\
7:41\
the greater sin.\
7:44\
"I, the Lord, will forgive\
whom I will forgive,\
7:47\
but of you it is required\
to forgive all men."\
7:54\
The teachings of our Savior\
and Redeemer are clear:\
7:59\
the sinner must be\
willing to forgive others\
8:03\
if he or she hopes to\
obtain forgiveness.\
8:08\
Brothers and sisters, are\
there people in our lives\
8:13\
who have hurt us?\
8:15\
Do we harbor what seem like\
fully justified feelings\
8:20\
of resentment and anger?\
8:23\
Are we letting pride keep us\
from forgiving and letting go?\
8:29\
I invite all of us\
to forgive completely\
8:34\
and let healing\
occur from within.\
8:37\
And even if forgiveness\
doesn't come today,\
8:41\
know that as we desire\
it and work for it,\
8:46\
it will come--just as it\
eventually did for me after\
8:52\
my brother's death.\
8:55\
Please also remember\
that an essential element\
8:59\
of forgiveness includes\
forgiving ourselves.\
9:04\
"He who has repented\
of his sins,"\
9:07\
the Lord said, "the same is\
forgiven, and I, the Lord,\
9:13\
remember them no more."\
9:17\
I plead for all of us this\
day to remember and follow\
9:21\
the example of Jesus Christ.\
9:24\
On the cross at\
Golgotha, in His anguish,\
9:30\
He uttered these words: "Father,\
forgive them; for they know not\
9:37\
what they do."\
9:40\
By having a forgiving\
spirit and acting upon it,\
9:44\
like my parents\
and oldest sister,\
9:47\
we can realize the\
promise of the Savior:\
9:51\
"Peace I leave with you,\
my peace I give unto you:\
9:58\
not as the world\
giveth, give I unto you.\
10:01\
Let not your heart be troubled,\
neither let it be afraid."\
10:08\
I witness this peace\
will come into our lives\
10:11\
as we heed the teachings\
of Jesus Christ\
10:15\
and follow His example\
by forgiving others.\
10:19\
As we forgive, I promise the\
Savior will strengthen us,\
10:25\
and His power and joy\
will flow into our lives.\
10:32\
The tomb is empty.\
10:35\
Christ lives.\
10:38\
I know Him.\
10:40\
And I love Him.\
10:45\
I am grateful for\
His grace, which\
10:49\
is the strengthening\
power that is\
10:52\
sufficient to heal all things.\
10:55\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
