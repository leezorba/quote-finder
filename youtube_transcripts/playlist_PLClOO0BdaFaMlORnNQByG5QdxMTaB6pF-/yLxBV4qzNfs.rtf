The Redeemer of Israel is\
indeed our only delight.\
0:07\
My beloved brothers and\
sisters, dear friends,\
0:10\
I am grateful to be with you\
on this wonderful general\
0:14\
conference weekend.\
0:16\
Harriet and I rejoice with\
you in sustaining Elders Gong\
0:20\
and Soares and the\
many who have received\
0:23\
significant new callings\
during this general conference.\
0:28\
Although I miss my dear friend\
President Thomas S. Monson,\
0:32\
I love, sustain, and support\
our prophet and President,\
0:38\
Russell M. Nelson, and\
his noble counselors.\
0:43\
I am also thankful and honored\
to once again work more closely\
0:47\
with my beloved fellow Brethren\
of the Quorum of the Twelve.\
0:52\
Most of all, I am deeply humbled\
and very happy to be a member\
0:57\
of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints,\
1:01\
where millions of men, women,\
and children are willing\
1:06\
to lift where they\
stand--in whatever capacity\
1:10\
or calling--and strive with\
all their heart to serve God\
1:14\
and His children, building\
the kingdom of God.\
1:19\
Today is a sacred day.\
1:22\
It is Easter Sunday,\
when we commemorate\
1:28\
that glorious morning when our\
Savior broke the bands of death\
1:33\
and emerged triumphant\
from the tomb.\
1:37\
Recently I asked the\
internet, "What day most\
1:47\
changed the course of history?"\
1:50\
The responses ranged from\
surprising and strange,\
1:54\
as you can expect, to insightful\
and thought-provoking--among\
2:00\
them, the day when a prehistoric\
asteroid struck the Yucatan\
2:05\
Peninsula, or when in 1440\
Johannes Gutenberg finished his\
2:12\
printing press, and of course\
the day in 1903 when the Wright\
2:19\
brothers showed the world\
that men really can fly.\
2:26\
If the same question were asked\
to you, what would you say?\
2:32\
In my mind the answer is clear.\
2:36\
To find the most\
important day in history,\
2:39\
we must go back to that\
evening almost 2,000 years ago\
2:44\
in the Garden of Gethsemane\
when Jesus Christ\
2:48\
knelt in intense prayer\
and offered Himself\
2:51\
as a ransom for our sins.\
2:55\
It was during this great\
and infinite sacrifice\
2:58\
of unparalleled suffering\
in both body and spirit\
3:02\
that Jesus Christ, even\
God, bled at every pore.\
3:08\
Out of perfect love, He gave\
all that we might receive all.\
3:19\
His supernal sacrifice,\
difficult to comprehend,\
3:23\
only to be felt with\
all our heart and mind,\
3:28\
reminds us of the\
universal debt of gratitude\
3:32\
we owe Christ for\
His divine gift.\
3:39\
Later that night,\
Jesus was brought\
3:41\
before religious and\
political authorities\
3:43\
who mocked Him, beat\
Him, and sentenced Him\
3:46\
to a shameful death.\
3:48\
He hung in agony upon the\
cross until, finally, "it [was]\
3:54\
finished."\
3:56\
His lifeless body was\
laid in a borrowed tomb.\
4:01\
And then, on the morning\
of the third day,\
4:04\
Jesus Christ, the\
Son of Almighty God,\
4:09\
emerged from the\
tomb as a glorious,\
4:13\
resurrected being of\
splendor, light, and majesty.\
4:18\
Yes, there are many\
events throughout history\
4:22\
that have profoundly affected\
the destiny of nations\
4:25\
and peoples.\
4:26\
But combine them all, and\
they cannot begin to compare\
4:31\
to the importance of what\
happened on that first Easter\
4:34\
morning.\
4:37\
What is it that makes\
the infinite sacrifice\
4:40\
and the Resurrection of Jesus\
Christ the most important event\
4:45\
in history--more\
influential than world wars,\
4:49\
cataclysmic disasters, and\
life-changing scientific\
4:54\
discoveries?\
4:57\
The answer lies in two great,\
insurmountable challenges\
5:04\
that every one of us faces.\
5:09\
First, we all die.\
5:13\
No matter how young,\
beautiful, healthy, or cautious\
5:18\
you are, someday your\
body will become lifeless.\
5:23\
Friends and family\
will mourn you.\
5:26\
But they cannot bring you back.\
5:29\
Nevertheless, because\
of Jesus Christ,\
5:33\
your death will be temporary.\
5:34\
Your spirit one day will\
reunite with your body.\
5:38\
This resurrected body will\
not be subject to death,\
5:42\
and you will live\
in the eternities,\
5:46\
free from pain and\
physical suffering.\
5:50\
This will happen because of\
Jesus the Christ, who laid down\
5:56\
His life and took it up again.\
5:59\
He did this for all\
who believe in Him.\
6:03\
He did this for all who\
do not believe in Him.\
6:09\
He did this even\
for those who mock,\
6:12\
revile, and curse His name.\
6:16\
Second, we have all sinned.\
6:20\
Our sins would forever keep\
us from living with God,\
6:25\
because "no unclean thing\
can enter into his kingdom."\
6:32\
As a result, every man, woman,\
and child was shut out of His\
6:37\
presence--that is, until Jesus\
Christ, the Lamb without spot,\
6:45\
offered His life as a\
ransom for our sins.\
6:51\
Because Jesus owed no debt to\
justice, He could pay our debt\
6:58\
and meet the demands of\
justice for every soul.\
7:03\
And that includes you and me.\
7:08\
Jesus Christ paid the\
price for our sins.\
7:14\
All of them.\
7:17\
On that most important\
day in history,\
7:19\
Jesus the Christ opened\
the gates of death\
7:22\
and cast aside the\
barriers that prevented us\
7:25\
from passing into the\
holy and hallowed halls\
7:29\
of everlasting life.\
7:31\
Because of our Lord\
and Savior, you and I\
7:37\
are granted a most precious\
and priceless gift.\
7:41\
Regardless of our past,\
we can repent and follow\
7:48\
the path that leads to celestial\
light and glory, surrounded\
7:54\
by the faithful children\
of Heavenly Father.\
8:00\
This is what we celebrate on\
Easter Sunday--we celebrate\
8:06\
life!\
8:09\
Because of Jesus Christ, we will\
rise from the despair of death\
8:13\
and embrace those we\
love, shedding tears\
8:16\
of overwhelming joy and\
overflowing gratitude.\
8:22\
Because of Jesus Christ, we will\
exist as eternal beings, worlds\
8:29\
without end.\
8:32\
Because of Jesus Christ, our\
sins can not only be erased;\
8:38\
they can be forgotten.\
8:42\
We can become\
purified and exalted.\
8:48\
Holy.\
8:50\
Because of our\
beloved Savior, we\
8:53\
can forever drink from\
the fountain of water that\
8:56\
springs up into eternal life.\
8:59\
We can dwell forever in the\
mansions of our eternal King,\
9:04\
in unimaginable glory\
and in perfect happiness.\
9:12\
In spite of all\
of this, there are\
9:15\
many in the world today\
who are either not aware of\
9:21\
or do not believe in the\
precious gift Jesus Christ has\
9:28\
given us.\
9:29\
They may have heard\
of Jesus Christ\
9:32\
and know of Him as\
a historical figure,\
9:34\
but they do not see Him\
for who He truly is.\
9:39\
When I think of this, I am\
reminded of the Savior standing\
9:45\
before the Roman prefect\
of Judea, Pontius Pilate,\
9:50\
just a few hours before\
the Savior's death.\
9:56\
Pilate viewed Jesus from a\
strictly worldly perspective.\
10:01\
Pilate had a job to do, and\
it involved two major tasks:\
10:07\
collecting taxes for Rome\
and keeping the peace.\
10:12\
Now the Jewish Sanhedrin\
had brought before him\
10:16\
a man who they claimed\
was an obstacle to both.\
10:21\
After interrogating\
his prisoner,\
10:24\
Pilate announced, "I find\
in him no fault at all."\
10:30\
But he felt he had to\
appease Jesus's accusers,\
10:35\
so Pilate called\
upon a local custom\
10:39\
that allowed one\
prisoner to be released\
10:41\
during Passover season.\
10:43\
Would they not have\
him release Jesus\
10:45\
instead of the notorious\
robber and murderer Barabbas?\
10:49\
But the tumultuous mob\
demanded that Pilate release\
10:57\
Barabbas and crucify Jesus.\
11:03\
"Why?"\
11:04\
Pilate asked.\
11:06\
"What evil [has] he done?"\
11:10\
But they only\
shouted the louder.\
11:12\
"Crucify him!"\
11:16\
In one final effort\
to satisfy the mob,\
11:19\
Pilate ordered his\
men to scourge Jesus.\
11:22\
This they did, leaving\
Him bloodied and bruised.\
11:27\
They mocked Him, placed a\
crown of thorns on His head,\
11:32\
and clothed Him\
in a purple robe.\
11:37\
Perhaps Pilate thought\
this would satisfy\
11:39\
the mob's lust for blood.\
11:41\
Perhaps they would\
take pity on the man.\
11:44\
"Behold, I bring him forth\
to you," Pilate said,\
11:49\
"that ye may know that I\
find no fault in him. ...\
11:53\
Behold the man!"\
11:58\
The Son of God\
stood in the flesh\
12:03\
before the people of Jerusalem.\
12:07\
They could see Jesus, but\
they did not truly behold Him.\
12:15\
They did not have eyes to see.\
12:19\
In a figurative\
sense, we too are\
12:22\
invited to "behold the man."\
12:26\
Opinions about Him\
vary in the world.\
12:29\
Ancient and modern\
prophets testify\
12:32\
that He is the Son of God.\
12:36\
I do this, too.\
12:38\
It is significant and\
important that we each come\
12:42\
to know for ourselves.\
12:46\
So when you ponder the life\
and ministry of Jesus Christ,\
12:50\
what do you see?\
12:53\
Those who find a\
way to truly behold\
12:57\
the Man find the doorway\
to life's greatest joys\
13:03\
and the balm to life's\
most demanding despairs.\
13:12\
So when you are encompassed\
by sorrows and grief,\
13:18\
behold the Man.\
13:21\
When you feel lost or\
forgotten, behold the Man.\
13:28\
When you are despairing,\
deserted, doubting, damaged,\
13:32\
or defeated, behold the Man.\
13:38\
He will comfort you.\
13:39\
He will heal you and give\
meaning to your journey.\
13:43\
He will pour out His\
Spirit and fill your heart\
13:47\
with exceeding joy.\
13:51\
He gives "power to\
the faint; and to them\
13:54\
that have no might he\
increaseth strength."\
13:59\
When we truly behold\
the Man, we learn of Him\
14:03\
and seek to align\
our lives with Him.\
14:07\
We repent and strive\
to refine our natures\
14:12\
and daily grow a\
little closer to Him.\
14:15\
We trust Him.\
14:17\
We show our love for Him\
by keeping His commandments\
14:21\
and by living up to\
our sacred covenants.\
14:26\
In other words, we\
become His disciples.\
14:32\
His refining light\
saturates our souls.\
14:37\
His grace uplifts us.\
14:40\
Our burdens are lightened,\
our peace deepened.\
14:45\
When we truly behold the\
Man, we have the promise\
14:51\
of a blessed future that\
inspires and upholds us\
14:54\
through the bends and\
bumps in life's journey.\
14:59\
Looking back, we will recognize\
that there is a divine pattern,\
15:04\
that the dots really connect.\
15:09\
As you accept His sacrifice,\
become His disciple,\
15:14\
and finally reach the end of\
your earthly journey, what\
15:17\
will become of the sorrows\
you have endured in this life?\
15:22\
They will be gone.\
15:24\
The disappointments, betrayals,\
persecutions you have faced?\
15:29\
Gone.\
15:30\
The suffering, heartache,\
guilt, shame, and anguish\
15:35\
you have passed through?\
15:37\
Gone.\
15:38\
Forgotten.\
15:41\
Is it any wonder that\
"we talk of Christ,\
15:45\
we rejoice in Christ,\
we preach of Christ,\
15:48\
we prophesy of Christ ... that\
our children may know to what\
15:55\
source they may look for a\
remission of their sins"?\
15:59\
Is it any wonder that we\
strive with all our hearts\
16:02\
to truly behold the Man?\
16:07\
My beloved brothers\
and sisters, I\
16:10\
testify that the most important\
day in the history of mankind\
16:15\
was the day when Jesus\
Christ, the living Son of God,\
16:21\
won the victory over death and\
sin for all of God's children.\
16:29\
And the most important\
day in your life and mine\
16:34\
is the day when we learn\
to "behold the man";\
16:39\
when we see Him for\
who He truly is;\
16:43\
when we partake\
with all our heart\
16:45\
and mind of His\
atoning power; when\
16:51\
with renewed enthusiasm\
and strength,\
16:54\
we commit to follow Him.\
16:57\
May that be a day that\
recurs over and over\
17:02\
and over again\
throughout our lives.\
17:08\
I leave you my\
testimony and blessing\
17:10\
that as we "behold the man,"\
we will find meaning, joy,\
17:17\
and peace in this earthly\
life and eternal life\
17:22\
in the world to come.\
17:24\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
