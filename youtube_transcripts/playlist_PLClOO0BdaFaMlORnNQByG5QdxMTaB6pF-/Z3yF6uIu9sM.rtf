A few years ago, my friends had\
a beautiful baby named Brigham.\
0:05\
After his birth, Brigham was\
diagnosed with a rare condition\
0:09\
called Hunter syndrome, which\
sadly meant that Brigham\
0:13\
would have a short life.\
0:14\
One day while Brigham\
and his family\
0:17\
were visiting the\
temple grounds,\
0:20\
Brigham pronounced\
a particular phrase;\
0:22\
twice he said, "One more day."\
0:26\
The very next day,\
Brigham passed away.\
0:30\
I have visited Brigham's grave a\
few times, and every time I do,\
0:35\
I contemplate the\
phrase "one more day."\
0:37\
I wonder what it would\
mean, what effect\
0:42\
it would have in my life to know\
that I had only one more day\
0:46\
to live.\
0:47\
How would I treat my wife,\
my children, and others?\
0:50\
How patient and\
polite would I be?\
0:52\
How would I take\
care of my body?\
0:54\
How fervently would I pray\
and search the scriptures?\
0:58\
I think that in one way or\
another we all, at some point,\
1:04\
will have a "one more day"\
realization--a realization that\
1:08\
we must use wisely\
the time we have.\
1:12\
In the Old Testament\
we read the story\
1:14\
of Hezekiah, king of Judah.\
1:16\
The prophet Isaiah\
announced to Hezekiah\
1:18\
that Hezekiah's life\
was about to end.\
1:22\
When he heard the\
prophet's words,\
1:24\
Hezekiah began to pray,\
plead, and weep sorely.\
1:28\
On that occasion Jehovah added\
15 years to Hezekiah's life.\
1:34\
If we were to be told we\
had a short time to live,\
1:38\
we too may plead for\
more days of life\
1:40\
in the name of things we should\
have done or done differently.\
1:45\
Regardless of the time\
the Lord, in His wisdom,\
1:47\
determines to grant each of us,\
of one thing we can be sure:\
1:52\
we all have a "today"\
to live, and the key\
1:56\
to making our day successful\
is to be willing to sacrifice.\
2:01\
The Lord said, "Behold,\
now it is called today\
2:06\
until the coming\
of the Son of Man,\
2:08\
and verily it is a\
day of sacrifice."\
2:12\
The word sacrifice comes\
from the Latin words sacer,\
2:15\
which means sacred, and facere,\
which means to make--in other\
2:19\
words, to make things sacred,\
to bring honor to them.\
2:23\
"Sacrifice brings forth\
the blessings of heaven."\
2:27\
In what ways will\
sacrifice make our days\
2:30\
meaningful and blessed?\
2:32\
First, personal\
sacrifice strengthens us\
2:36\
and gives value to the\
things we sacrifice for.\
2:40\
Some years ago on fast\
Sunday, an elderly sister\
2:44\
came to the pulpit to\
share her testimony.\
2:46\
She lived in the\
city called Iquitos,\
2:49\
which is the Peruvian Amazon.\
2:51\
She told us that from\
the time of her baptism,\
2:55\
she had always had the goal\
of receiving the ordinances\
2:59\
of the temple in Lima, Peru.\
3:01\
She faithfully paid a full tithe\
and saved her meager income\
3:05\
for years.\
3:07\
Her joy upon going to\
the temple and receiving\
3:10\
the sacred ordinances therein\
was expressed in these words:\
3:15\
"Today I can say\
that I finally feel\
3:19\
ready to go through the veil.\
3:21\
I am the happiest woman in\
the world; I have saved money,\
3:25\
you have no idea for how\
long, to visit the temple,\
3:28\
and after seven days on the\
river and 18 hours by bus,\
3:34\
I was finally in the\
house of the Lord.\
3:37\
When leaving that holy\
place, I said to myself,\
3:41\
after all the sacrifice that\
has been required for me to come\
3:46\
to the temple, I\
will not let anything\
3:49\
make me take lightly\
every covenant I made;\
3:53\
it would be a waste.\
3:54\
This is a very\
serious commitment!"\
3:58\
I learned from this sweet\
sister that personal sacrifice\
4:02\
is an invaluable force\
that drives our decisions\
4:06\
and our determinations.\
4:08\
Personal sacrifice drives\
our actions, our commitments,\
4:12\
and covenants and gives\
sacred things meaning.\
4:16\
Second, sacrifice\
we make for others,\
4:20\
and that others make for us,\
results in blessings for all.\
4:24\
When I was a student\
in dental school,\
4:26\
the financial outlook\
of our local economy\
4:28\
was not very encouraging.\
4:30\
Inflation dramatically\
decreased the value of currency\
4:34\
from one day to the next.\
4:36\
I remember the year when I was\
to enroll in surgery practices;\
4:41\
I needed to have all the\
necessary surgical equipment\
4:44\
before enrolling that semester.\
4:46\
My parents saved\
the needed funds.\
4:49\
But one night something\
dramatic happened.\
4:53\
We went to buy the equipment,\
only to discover that\
4:58\
the amount of money we had to\
buy all the equipment now was\
5:02\
sufficient to buy only a pair of\
surgical tweezers--and nothing\
5:06\
else.\
5:07\
We returned home with empty\
hands and with heavy hearts\
5:11\
at the thought of my losing\
a semester of college.\
5:15\
Suddenly, however, my mother\
said, "Taylor, come with me;\
5:20\
let's go out."\
5:22\
We went downtown where\
there were many places that\
5:25\
buy and sell jewelry.\
5:28\
When we arrived at one store,\
my mother took out of her purse\
5:31\
a small blue velvet bag\
containing a beautiful gold\
5:35\
bracelet with an inscription\
that read, "To my dear\
5:39\
daughter from your father."\
5:42\
It was a bracelet that my\
grandfather had given her\
5:45\
on one of her birthdays.\
5:47\
Then, before my\
eyes, she sold it.\
5:52\
When she received the\
money she told me,\
5:54\
"If there is one\
thing I am sure of,\
5:56\
it is that you are\
going to be a dentist.\
5:59\
Go and buy all the\
equipment you need."\
6:01\
Now, brothers and\
sisters, can you\
6:04\
imagine what kind of student\
I became from that moment on?\
6:07\
I wanted to be the best\
and finish my studies soon\
6:11\
because I knew the high cost of\
the sacrifice she was making.\
6:16\
I learned that the\
sacrifice our loved ones\
6:19\
make for us refresh\
us like cool water\
6:23\
in the middle of the desert.\
6:25\
Such sacrifice brings\
hope and motivation.\
6:29\
Third, any sacrifice\
we make is small\
6:33\
compared to the sacrifice\
of the Son of God.\
6:37\
What is the value of\
even a beloved gold\
6:39\
bracelet compared\
to the sacrifice\
6:41\
of the very Son of God?\
6:43\
How can we honor that\
infinite sacrifice?\
6:46\
Each day we can remember\
that we have "one more\
6:51\
day" to live and be faithful.\
6:53\
Amulek taught, "Yea,\
I would that ye\
6:58\
would come forth and harden\
not your hearts any longer;\
7:01\
for behold, now is the time\
and the day of your salvation;\
7:06\
and therefore, if ye will repent\
and harden not your hearts,\
7:09\
immediately shall the\
great plan of redemption\
7:13\
be brought about unto you."\
7:15\
In other words, if we\
will offer to the Lord\
7:18\
the sacrifice of a broken\
heart and a contrite spirit,\
7:23\
immediately the blessings of\
the great plan of happiness\
7:26\
are manifest in our lives.\
7:29\
The plan of\
redemption is possible\
7:31\
thanks to the sacrifice\
of Jesus Christ.\
7:33\
As He Himself described, the\
sacrifice "caused myself,\
7:39\
even God, the greatest of all,\
to tremble because of pain,\
7:44\
and to bleed at every pore,\
and to suffer both body\
7:48\
and spirit--and would that I\
might not drink the bitter cup,\
7:52\
and shrink."\
7:54\
And it is because\
of this sacrifice,\
7:56\
after following the process\
of sincere repentance,\
7:59\
that we can feel the weight of\
our mistakes and sins lifted.\
8:03\
In fact, guilt, shame, pain,\
sorrow, and looking down at\
8:08\
ourselves are replaced with a\
clear conscience, happiness,\
8:12\
joy, and hope.\
8:13\
At the same time,\
as we honor and are\
8:17\
grateful for His sacrifice, we\
can receive in a great measure\
8:20\
the intense desire to be\
better children of God,\
8:23\
to stay away from sin, and to\
keep the covenants like never\
8:26\
before.\
8:28\
Then, like Enos after receiving\
the forgiveness of his sins,\
8:33\
we will feel the desire\
to sacrifice ourselves\
8:37\
and to seek the well-being\
of our brothers and sisters.\
8:40\
And we will be more willing\
every "one more day"\
8:44\
to follow the invitation\
that President Howard\
8:46\
Hunter extended to us when\
he said: "Mend a quarrel.\
8:52\
Seek out a forgotten friend.\
8:54\
Dismiss suspicion and\
replace it with trust.\
8:57\
...\
8:57\
Give a soft answer.\
8:59\
Encourage youth.\
9:01\
Manifest your loyalty\
in word and deed.\
9:06\
Keep a promise.\
9:07\
Forgo a grudge.\
9:09\
Forgive an enemy.\
9:11\
Apologize.\
9:12\
Try to understand.\
9:14\
Examine your demands on others.\
9:16\
Think first of someone else.\
9:18\
Be kind.\
9:19\
Be gentle.\
9:21\
Laugh a little more.\
9:22\
Express your gratitude.\
9:24\
Welcome a stranger.\
9:27\
Gladden the heart of a child.\
9:28\
...\
9:29\
Speak your love and\
then speak it again."\
9:36\
May we fill our days with\
that impulse and the strength\
9:39\
that personal sacrifice and\
the sacrifice that we make\
9:42\
or receive from others give us.\
9:44\
And in a special way, may we\
enjoy the peace and rejoicing\
9:49\
that the sacrifice of the\
Only Begotten offers us: yes,\
9:53\
that peace that is mentioned\
when we read that Adam fell\
9:57\
that men might be, and men\
are--you are--that you might\
10:02\
have joy.\
10:03\
That joy is real joy\
that only the sacrifice\
10:07\
and the Atonement of the Savior\
Jesus Christ can provide.\
10:12\
It is my prayer that we follow\
Him, that we believe Him,\
10:17\
that we love Him, and that\
we feel the love demonstrated\
10:21\
by His sacrifice every time\
we have the opportunity\
10:25\
to live one more day.\
10:28\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
