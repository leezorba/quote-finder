Mistakes are a fact of life.\
0:04\
Learning to skillfully play the\
piano is essentially impossible\
0:09\
without making thousands of\
mistakes--maybe even a million.\
0:13\
To learn a foreign language,\
one must face the embarrassment\
0:17\
of making thousands of\
mistakes--maybe even a million.\
0:20\
Even the world's\
greatest athletes\
0:23\
never stop making mistakes.\
0:26\
"Success," it has been said,\
"isn't the absence of failure,\
0:29\
but going from failure to\
failure without any loss\
0:33\
of enthusiasm."\
0:35\
With his invention\
of the light bulb,\
0:37\
Thomas Edison said, "I\
didn't fail 1,000 times.\
0:41\
The light bulb was an\
invention with 1,000 steps."\
0:44\
C. S. Lewis called\
failures "finger posts\
0:48\
on the road to achievement."\
0:50\
Hopefully, each mistake we make\
becomes a lesson in wisdom,\
0:54\
turning stumbling blocks\
into stepping-stones.\
0:58\
Nephi's unwavering faith helped\
him go from failure to failure\
1:02\
until he finally obtained\
the brass plates.\
1:06\
It took Moses 10 attempts\
before he finally\
1:10\
found success in fleeing\
Egypt with the Israelites.\
1:14\
We may wonder--if both\
Nephi and Moses were\
1:17\
on the Lord's errand, why didn't\
the Lord intervene and help\
1:20\
them achieve success\
on their first try?\
1:24\
Why did He allow them--and why\
does He allow us--to flounder\
1:28\
and fail in our\
attempts to succeed?\
1:31\
Among many important answers to\
that question, here are a few:\
1:35\
First, the Lord knows\
that "these things\
1:38\
shall give [us] experience,\
and shall be for [our] good."\
1:41\
Second, to allow us\
to "taste the bitter,\
1:43\
that [we] may know\
to prize the good."\
1:46\
Third, to prove that "the\
battle is the Lord's,"\
1:49\
and it is only by His grace\
that we can accomplish His work\
1:53\
and become like Him.\
1:55\
Fourth, to help us develop\
and hone scores of Christlike\
1:59\
attributes that cannot\
be refined except through\
2:02\
opposition and "in the\
furnace of affliction."\
2:06\
So, amid a life full\
of stumbling blocks\
2:09\
and imperfection, we all are\
grateful for second chances.\
2:14\
In 1970, as a new\
freshman at BYU,\
2:17\
I enrolled in a beginning\
course on the essentials\
2:20\
of physics taught by Jae Ballif,\
an outstanding professor.\
2:25\
After finishing each\
unit of the course,\
2:28\
he would administer an exam.\
2:30\
If a student received a C\
and wanted a better grade,\
2:33\
Professor Ballif would\
allow the student\
2:35\
to take a modified exam\
covering the same material.\
2:39\
If the student received\
a B on the second attempt\
2:42\
and was still unsatisfied,\
he could take the test\
2:45\
a third time and a\
fourth, and so on.\
2:48\
By allowing me numerous\
second chances,\
2:52\
he helped me excel and finally\
earn an A in the class.\
2:56\
He was an uncommonly wise\
professor who inspired his\
3:00\
students to keep trying--to\
consider failure as a tutor,\
3:04\
not as a tragedy, and to not\
fear failure but to learn from\
3:08\
it.\
3:09\
Recently I telephoned\
this great man\
3:12\
47 years after taking\
his physics course.\
3:15\
I asked him why he was\
willing to allow students\
3:19\
unlimited attempts to\
improve their grade.\
3:21\
His response: "I wanted to be on\
the same side as the students."\
3:27\
While we are grateful for second\
chances following mistakes,\
3:31\
or failures of\
the mind, we stand\
3:34\
all amazed at the Savior's\
grace in giving us\
3:36\
second chances in overcoming\
sin, or failures of the heart.\
3:42\
No one is more on our\
side than the Savior.\
3:45\
He allows us to take and\
keep retaking His exams.\
3:49\
To become like Him will require\
countless second chances\
3:54\
in our day-to-day struggles\
with the natural man,\
3:57\
such as controlling\
appetites, learning patience\
4:00\
and forgiveness, overcoming\
slothfulness, avoiding\
4:04\
sins of omission,\
just to name a few.\
4:06\
If to err is human\
nature, how many failures\
4:11\
will it take us until our nature\
is no longer human but divine?\
4:16\
Thousands?\
4:18\
More likely--a million.\
4:21\
Knowing that the strait\
and narrow path would\
4:23\
be strewn with trials\
and that failures\
4:26\
would be a daily\
occurrence for us,\
4:28\
the Savior paid\
an infinite price\
4:31\
to give us as many chances as it\
would take to successfully pass\
4:35\
our mortal probation.\
4:37\
The opposition which\
He allows can often\
4:40\
seem insurmountable and\
almost impossible to bear,\
4:44\
yet He doesn't leave\
us without hope.\
4:47\
To keep our hope resilient\
as we face life's trials,\
4:50\
the Savior's grace is ever\
ready and ever present.\
4:54\
His grace is a "divine means\
of help or strength, ...\
4:57\
an enabling power that allows\
men and women to lay hold\
5:01\
on eternal life and exaltation\
after they have expended\
5:05\
their own best efforts."\
5:06\
His grace and His loving eye are\
upon us throughout our entire\
5:10\
journey as He inspires, lightens\
burdens, strengthens, delivers,\
5:15\
protects, heals, and otherwise\
"succor[s] his people,"\
5:19\
even as they stumble along\
the strait and narrow path.\
5:23\
Repentance is God's\
ever-accessible gift\
5:26\
that allows and enables us\
to go from failure to failure\
5:31\
without any loss of enthusiasm.\
5:34\
Repentance isn't His backup\
plan in the event we might fail.\
5:39\
Repentance is His plan,\
knowing that we will.\
5:43\
This is the gospel\
of repentance,\
5:45\
and as President Russell\
M. Nelson has observed,\
5:49\
it will be "a\
lifetime curriculum."\
5:52\
In this lifetime\
curriculum of repentance,\
5:54\
the sacrament is the\
Lord's designated way\
5:57\
of providing continual\
access to His forgiveness.\
6:01\
If we partake with a broken\
heart and a contrite spirit,\
6:05\
He proffers us weekly pardon\
as we progress from failure\
6:10\
to failure along\
the covenant path.\
6:13\
For "notwithstanding\
their sins, my bowels\
6:16\
are filled with\
compassion towards them."\
6:20\
But just how many times\
will He forgive us?\
6:23\
How long is His long-suffering?\
6:26\
On one occasion Peter\
asked the Savior,\
6:29\
"Lord, how oft shall my\
brother sin against me,\
6:33\
and I forgive him?\
till seven times?"\
6:36\
Presumably, Peter thought seven\
was a sufficiently high number\
6:40\
to emphasize the folly of\
forgiving too many times\
6:44\
and that benevolence\
should have its limits.\
6:46\
In response, the Savior\
essentially told Peter to not\
6:49\
even count--to not establish\
limits on forgiveness.\
6:54\
"Jesus saith unto him, I say not\
unto thee, Until seven times:\
6:59\
but, Until seventy times seven."\
7:02\
Obviously, the Savior\
was not establishing\
7:05\
an upper limit of 490.\
7:07\
That would be analogous\
to saying that partaking\
7:10\
of the sacrament\
has a limit of 490,\
7:13\
and then on the 491st time,\
a heavenly auditor intercedes\
7:18\
and says, "I'm so sorry, but\
your repentance card just\
7:21\
expired--from this point\
forward, you're on your own."\
7:29\
The Lord used the math\
of seventy times seven\
7:33\
as a metaphor of His Infinite\
Atonement, His boundless love,\
7:38\
and His limitless grace.\
7:40\
"Yea, and as often\
as my people repent\
7:45\
will I forgive them their\
trespasses against me."\
7:49\
That doesn't mean that the\
sacrament becomes a license\
7:51\
to sin.\
7:52\
That's one reason the\
Lord included this phrase\
7:55\
in the book of Moroni: "But as\
oft as they repented and sought\
7:59\
forgiveness, with real\
intent, they were forgiven."\
8:04\
"Real intent" implies with\
real effort and real change.\
8:08\
"Change" is the principal word\
the Guide to the Scriptures\
8:12\
uses to define repentance:\
"A change of mind and heart\
8:16\
that brings a fresh attitude\
toward God, oneself, and life\
8:21\
in general."\
8:22\
That kind of change results\
in spiritual growth.\
8:25\
Our success, then, isn't\
going from failure to failure,\
8:30\
but growing from\
failure to failure\
8:33\
without any loss of enthusiasm.\
8:37\
Concerning change, consider this\
simple insight: "Things that\
8:40\
don't change remain the same."\
8:44\
This obvious truth isn't meant\
to insult your intelligence\
8:48\
but is the profound wisdom\
of President Boyd K.\
8:50\
Packer, who then added, "And\
when we are through changing--\
8:54\
we're through."\
8:57\
Because we don't\
want to be through\
8:58\
until we become\
as our Savior is,\
9:01\
we need to continue getting\
up each time we fall,\
9:06\
with a desire to keep\
growing and progressing\
9:09\
despite our weaknesses.\
9:10\
In our weakness,\
He reassures us,\
9:13\
"My grace is\
sufficient for thee:\
9:16\
for my strength is made\
perfect in weakness."\
9:20\
Only with time-lapse\
photography or growth charts\
9:23\
can we discern our\
physical growth.\
9:25\
Likewise, our spiritual\
growth is usually\
9:29\
imperceptible except through\
the rearview lens of time.\
9:32\
It would be wise to regularly\
take an introspective look\
9:37\
through that lens to\
recognize our progress\
9:40\
and inspire us to "press forward\
with a steadfastness in Christ,\
9:45\
having a perfect\
brightness of hope."\
9:48\
I am eternally grateful for\
the loving kindness, patience,\
9:52\
and long-suffering of Heavenly\
Parents and the Savior,\
9:56\
who allow us countless second\
chances on our journey back\
10:01\
to Their presence.\
10:02\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
