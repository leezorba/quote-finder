Not long after the\
Church was organized\
0:04\
in this last dispensation, the\
Lord stated in a revelation,\
0:09\
"And by the prayer of your\
faith ye shall receive my law,\
0:13\
that ye may know how\
to govern my church\
0:16\
and have all things\
right before me."\
0:19\
This principle has been followed\
in the Church--and that promise\
0:23\
has been honored by\
the Lord--ever since.\
0:26\
Patterns for priesthood\
organization and service\
0:30\
have been revealed\
from time to time,\
0:32\
beginning with\
the Prophet Joseph\
0:34\
Smith, when priesthood\
offices and quorums were\
0:38\
first established.\
0:40\
Significant refinements were\
revealed and implemented\
0:44\
during the tenure of\
Presidents Brigham\
0:47\
Young, John Taylor, and Spencer\
W. Kimball, among others,\
0:52\
with respect to the Quorum\
of the Twelve, the Seventy,\
0:57\
high priests, and other\
offices and quorums in both\
1:02\
the Melchizedek and\
Aaronic Priesthoods.\
1:05\
Now, in a historic\
statement just moments ago,\
1:09\
President Russell\
M. Nelson announced\
1:11\
a further crucial adjustment.\
1:14\
If I may repeat some\
of his statement,\
1:16\
quoting: "Tonight we announce\
a significant restructuring\
1:21\
of our Melchizedek\
Priesthood quorums\
1:24\
to accomplish the work of\
the Lord more effectively.\
1:28\
In each ward, the high priests\
and the elders will now be\
1:31\
combined into one\
elders quorum ...\
1:35\
[and] the composition of [the\
stake high priests] quorum\
1:38\
will be based on current\
priesthood callings."\
1:42\
PRESIDENT NELSON ADDED:\
"These modifications\
1:45\
have been under study\
for many months.\
1:48\
We have felt a pressing\
need to improve the way\
1:52\
we care for our members.\
1:54\
...\
1:54\
To do that better,\
we need to strengthen\
1:57\
our priesthood quorums\
to give greater direction\
2:01\
to the ministering\
of love and support\
2:02\
that the Lord intends\
for His Saints.\
2:06\
"These adjustments are\
inspired of the Lord.\
2:09\
As we implement them, we will\
be even more effective than we\
2:13\
have ... been previously."\
2:16\
At the First\
Presidency's direction,\
2:18\
Elder Ronald A. Rasband\
and I will add some detail\
2:21\
that we trust will respond\
to questions you may have.\
2:26\
First, to reiterate,\
what are the adjustments\
2:29\
for ward high priests\
groups and elders quorums?\
2:33\
In wards, members of elders\
quorums and high priests groups\
2:38\
will now be combined into one\
Melchizedek Priesthood quorum\
2:41\
with one quorum presidency.\
2:44\
This quorum, increased\
in numbers and unity,\
2:48\
will be designated\
the "elders quorum."\
2:51\
High priests groups\
are discontinued.\
2:55\
The elders quorum\
includes all elders\
2:58\
and prospective\
elders in the ward\
3:00\
as well as high priests\
who are not currently\
3:04\
serving in the bishopric,\
in the stake presidency,\
3:08\
on the high council, or\
as functioning patriarchs.\
3:12\
The high priests\
quorum in the stake\
3:15\
will be composed of\
those high priests who\
3:18\
are serving in the\
stake presidency,\
3:21\
in bishoprics, on\
the high council,\
3:23\
and as functioning patriarchs.\
3:28\
How is the presidency of the\
elders quorum to be organized?\
3:32\
The stake presidency will\
release current high priests\
3:36\
group leaderships and\
elders quorum presidencies\
3:40\
and will call a new elders\
quorum president and counselors\
3:44\
in each ward.\
3:46\
The new elders\
quorum presidency may\
3:49\
include elders and high priests,\
of varying ages and experience,\
3:53\
serving together in\
one quorum presidency.\
3:56\
An elder or a high priest may\
serve as the quorum president\
4:01\
or as a counselor\
in the presidency.\
4:05\
This is not a "takeover" of\
elders quorums by high priests.\
4:10\
[LAUGHTER]\
4:12\
We expect elders\
and high priests\
4:15\
to work together in any\
combination in the quorum\
4:19\
presidency and in\
quorum service.\
4:21\
These quorum adjustments\
should be implemented as soon\
4:26\
as conveniently possible.\
4:29\
Does this adjustment\
in quorum structure\
4:31\
change the priesthood office\
held by quorum members?\
4:35\
No, this action does not\
rescind any priesthood office\
4:40\
to which any quorum member may\
have been ordained in the past.\
4:44\
As you know, a man\
may be ordained\
4:46\
to different priesthood\
offices over his lifetime,\
4:49\
and he does not lose or\
forfeit any prior ordination\
4:53\
when he receives a new one.\
4:55\
While in some instances\
a priesthood bearer\
4:58\
may serve in more than\
one office at a time,\
5:01\
as when a high priest\
also serves as a patriarch\
5:05\
or as a bishop, he\
typically does not\
5:07\
function in all his priesthood\
offices at the same time.\
5:11\
Bishops and Seventies,\
for instance,\
5:14\
do not actively serve in those\
offices once they are released\
5:18\
or made emeritus.\
5:19\
Thus, whatever other priesthood\
office or offices a man\
5:25\
may hold, while he is a\
member of the elders quorum,\
5:28\
he serves as an elder.\
5:32\
Years ago, President\
Boyd K. Packer\
5:34\
observed that "the\
priesthood is greater\
5:37\
than any of its offices.\
5:39\
...\
5:39\
The priesthood is not divisible.\
5:41\
An elder holds as much\
priesthood as an Apostle.\
5:46\
When a man [has the priesthood\
conferred upon him],\
5:49\
he receives all of it.\
5:51\
However, there\
are offices within\
5:54\
the priesthood--divisions of\
authority and responsibility.\
5:58\
...\
5:58\
Sometimes one office\
is spoken of as being\
6:02\
'higher ...' or 'lower\
than' another office.\
6:05\
Rather than 'higher' or 'lower,'\
offices in the Melchizedek\
6:10\
Priesthood represent\
different areas of service."\
6:13\
Brethren, I devoutly hope\
that we will no longer\
6:18\
speak in terms of being\
"advanced" to another office\
6:22\
in the Melchizedek Priesthood.\
6:25\
Elders will continue to be\
ordained high priests when they\
6:30\
are called to a stake\
presidency, high council,\
6:34\
or bishopric--or at other times\
as determined by the stake\
6:38\
president through prayerful\
consideration and inspiration.\
6:43\
When their terms of service in a\
stake presidency, high council,\
6:47\
or bishopric are\
completed, high priests\
6:51\
will rejoin the elders\
quorum in their ward.\
6:56\
Who directs the work of the\
elders quorum president?\
7:00\
The stake president presides\
over the Melchizedek Priesthood\
7:03\
in his stake.\
7:04\
Therefore, the elders\
quorum president\
7:06\
is directly responsible to\
the stake president, who\
7:10\
provides training and guidance\
from the stake presidency\
7:14\
and through the high council.\
7:16\
The bishop, as the presiding\
high priest in the ward,\
7:19\
also meets regularly with\
the elders quorum president.\
7:23\
The bishop counsels with him\
and gives appropriate direction\
7:27\
regarding how best\
to serve and bless\
7:31\
ward members, working in harmony\
with all ward organizations.\
7:38\
What are the purposes of the\
adjustments to Melchizedek\
7:41\
Priesthood quorums?\
7:42\
Having one Melchizedek\
Priesthood quorum in a ward\
7:47\
unifies priesthood\
holders to accomplish\
7:51\
all aspects of the\
work of salvation,\
7:53\
including the temple\
and family history\
7:56\
work previously coordinated\
by the high priests groups.\
8:00\
It allows quorum members\
of all ages and backgrounds\
8:04\
to benefit from the perspective\
and experience of one another\
8:08\
and those in different\
stages of life.\
8:11\
It also provides\
additional opportunities\
8:15\
for experienced priesthood\
holders to mentor others,\
8:18\
including prospective elders,\
new members, young adults,\
8:23\
and those returning\
to Church activity.\
8:26\
I cannot adequately express\
how excited I am to contemplate\
8:31\
the increasingly vital role\
that elders quorums will play\
8:35\
in the future.\
8:37\
The wisdom, experience,\
capacity, and strength\
8:42\
that will be found\
in these quorums\
8:45\
portend a new day and a new\
standard of priesthood service\
8:50\
across the Church.\
8:53\
Twenty years ago in\
general conference,\
8:56\
I related a story first\
told by Elder Vaughn J.\
8:59\
Featherstone of the Seventy that\
I believe bears repeating here.\
9:07\
In 1918, Brother\
George Goates was\
9:11\
a farmer who raised sugar\
beets in Lehi, Utah.\
9:16\
Winter came early that year\
and froze much of his beet crop\
9:22\
in the ground.\
9:23\
For George and his young\
son Francis, the harvest\
9:28\
was slow and difficult.\
Meanwhile, an influenza\
9:33\
epidemic was raging.\
9:35\
The dreaded disease claimed the\
lives of George's son Charles\
9:40\
and three of Charles's small\
children--two little girls\
9:45\
and a boy.\
9:46\
In the course of only six\
days, a grieving George Goates\
9:52\
made three separate\
trips to Ogden, Utah,\
9:56\
to bring the bodies\
home for burial.\
9:59\
At the end of this\
terrible interlude,\
10:03\
George and Francis\
hitched up their wagon\
10:06\
and headed back\
to the beet field.\
10:10\
"[On the way] they passed wagon\
after wagon-load of beets being\
10:13\
hauled to the factory ...\
10:15\
driven by neighborhood farmers.\
10:18\
As they passed by, each driver\
would wave a greeting: 'Hi ya,\
10:23\
Uncle George,' 'Sure sorry,\
George,' 'Tough break,\
10:28\
George,' 'You've got a\
lot of friends, George.'\
10:34\
"On the last wagon was ...\
freckled-faced Jasper Rolfe.\
10:38\
He waved a cheery\
greeting and called out:\
10:40\
'That's all of\
'em, Uncle George.'\
10:44\
"[Brother Goates] turned\
to Francis and said:\
10:46\
'I wish it was all of ours.'\
10:49\
"When they arrived\
at the farm gate,\
10:51\
Francis jumped down off\
the big red beet wagon\
10:54\
and opened the gate as [his\
father] drove onto the field.\
10:58\
[George] pulled up,\
stopped the team, ...\
11:01\
and scanned the field. ...\
11:03\
There wasn't a sugar beet\
[in] the whole field.\
11:07\
Then it dawned upon him what\
Jasper Rolfe meant when he\
11:11\
called out: 'That's all\
of 'em, Uncle George!'\
11:16\
"[George] got down\
off the wagon,\
11:18\
picked up a handful of the rich,\
brown soil he loved so much,\
11:22\
and then ... a beet top, and\
he looked for a moment at these\
11:26\
symbols of his labor, as if\
he couldn't believe his eyes.\
11:31\
"Then [he] sat down on a pile\
of beet tops--this man who had\
11:35\
brought four of his loved ones\
home for burial in the course\
11:39\
of only six days; made\
caskets, dug graves,\
11:42\
and even helped with the burial\
clothing--this amazing man who\
11:46\
had never faltered,\
nor flinched,\
11:48\
nor wavered throughout this\
agonizing ordeal--sat down\
11:53\
on a pile of beet tops and\
sobbed like a little child.\
11:59\
"Then he arose and\
wiped his eyes, ...\
12:02\
looked up at the sky, and\
said: 'Thanks, Father,\
12:05\
for the elders of our ward.'"\
12:11\
Yes, thanks be to God for\
the men of the priesthood\
12:15\
and for the service\
they will yet\
12:17\
render in lifting\
individuals and families\
12:20\
and in establishing Zion.\
12:23\
The First Presidency, the\
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,\
12:27\
and the Presidency\
of the Seventy\
12:29\
have considered\
these adjustments\
12:31\
over an extended period of time.\
12:34\
With much prayer, careful study\
of the scriptural foundation\
12:39\
of priesthood quorums,\
and confirmation\
12:42\
that this is the Lord's\
will, we are moving forward\
12:46\
with unanimity in what\
is in reality one more\
12:50\
step in the unfolding\
of the Restoration.\
12:54\
The Lord's direction\
is manifest,\
12:56\
and I rejoice in it as I bear\
witness of Him, His priesthood,\
13:02\
and your ordinations\
in that priesthood,\
13:05\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
