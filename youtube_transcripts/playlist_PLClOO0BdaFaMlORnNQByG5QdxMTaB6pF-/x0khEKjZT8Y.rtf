0:07\
DEAR BRETHREN: As\
directed by revelation\
0:10\
in section 120 of the\
Doctrine and Covenants,\
0:13\
the Council on the\
Disposition of the Tithes,\
0:15\
composed of the First\
Presidency, the Quorum\
0:19\
of the Twelve Apostles, and\
the Presiding Bishopric,\
0:21\
authorizes the expenditure\
of Church funds.\
0:25\
Church entities disburse\
funds in accordance\
0:28\
with approved budgets,\
policies, and procedures.\
0:32\
Church Auditing, which consists\
of credentialed professionals\
0:35\
and is independent of all\
other Church departments,\
0:38\
has responsibility\
to perform audits\
0:40\
for the purpose of providing\
reasonable assurance regarding\
0:44\
contributions received,\
expenditures made,\
0:47\
and safeguarding\
of Church assets.\
0:50\
Based upon audits\
performed, Church Auditing\
0:53\
is of the opinion that\
in all material respects,\
0:55\
contributions received,\
expenditures made,\
0:58\
and assets of the\
Church for the year 2017\
1:02\
have been recorded\
and administered\
1:04\
in accordance with approved\
Church budgets, policies,\
1:07\
and accounting practices.\
1:09\
The Church follows\
the practices taught\
1:11\
to its members of\
living within a budget,\
1:14\
avoiding debt, and saving\
against a time of need.\
1:18\
Respectfully submitted,\
Church Auditing Department.\
1:21\
Kevin R. Jergensen,\
managing director.\
