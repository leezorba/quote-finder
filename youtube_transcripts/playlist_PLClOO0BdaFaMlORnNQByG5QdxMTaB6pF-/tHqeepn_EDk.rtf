I add my welcome to Elder\
Gong and Elder Soares\
0:07\
to the unparalleled brotherhood\
of the Quorum of the Twelve.\
0:12\
In sustaining\
President Russell M.\
0:13\
Nelson as the Lord's prophet\
and as President of The Church\
0:17\
of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints,\
0:19\
we were part of a divinely\
decreed solemn assembly--solemn\
0:25\
because the events of this\
past hour have been anticipated\
0:29\
in the heavens since\
before the world was.\
0:32\
The Lord Jesus Christ,\
who directs His work,\
0:36\
has today, through\
President Eyring,\
0:39\
presented His prophet, His\
anointed leader, to us,\
0:43\
His covenant people,\
allowing us publicly\
0:48\
to manifest our willingness\
to sustain him and follow\
0:51\
his counsel.\
0:55\
Our heaven-directed assembly is\
not in this Conference Center\
1:04\
alone, but across the world--in\
chapels in Asia, Africa,\
1:11\
and North America; in homes\
in Central and South America\
1:17\
and Europe; on covered patios\
in the Pacific and the islands\
1:24\
of the sea.\
1:25\
This assembly is in whatever\
part of the world you might be,\
1:39\
even if your connection\
is no more than the audio\
1:45\
of your smartphone.\
1:47\
Our raised hands were not\
counted by our bishops,\
1:55\
but they were surely\
noted in heaven,\
2:00\
as our covenant is with\
God and our action is\
2:04\
recorded in the book of life.\
2:08\
The selection of a prophet\
is made by the Lord Himself.\
2:11\
There is no\
campaigning, no debates;\
2:14\
no posturing for position;\
no dissension, distrust,\
2:19\
confusion, or commotion.\
2:23\
I too confirm that\
the power of heaven\
2:27\
was with us in the\
upper room of the temple\
2:29\
as we prayerfully\
encircled President Nelson\
2:33\
and felt the undeniable\
approval of the Lord upon him.\
2:40\
President Nelson's selection\
to serve as God's prophet\
2:43\
was made long ago.\
2:44\
The Lord's words to Jeremiah\
also apply to President Nelson:\
2:49\
"Before I formed thee in\
the belly I knew thee;\
2:53\
and before thou camest forth out\
of the womb I sanctified thee,\
2:58\
and I ordained thee a\
prophet unto the nations."\
3:03\
Only three years ago,\
Elder Nelson, at age 90,\
3:09\
was fourth in\
seniority, with two\
3:12\
of the three senior\
Apostles being\
3:15\
younger in age than he was.\
3:17\
The Lord, who controls life\
and death, selects His prophet.\
3:22\
President Nelson, at age\
93, is in amazing health.\
3:27\
We hope he will be with us\
for another decade or two,\
3:30\
but for now we are\
trying to persuade\
3:35\
him to stay off the ski slopes.\
3:42\
While we sustain the prophet\
as the Lord's anointed,\
3:45\
let it be clear that we\
worship only God, our Heavenly\
3:49\
Father, and His divine Son.\
3:51\
It is through the\
merits, the mercy,\
3:54\
and the grace of our\
Savior, Jesus Christ,\
3:57\
that we can one day enter\
again into Their presence.\
4:02\
But Jesus taught\
an important truth\
4:04\
about the servants\
He sends to us.\
4:07\
"He that receiveth you,"\
He said, "receiveth me,\
4:11\
and he that receiveth me\
receiveth him that sent me."\
4:16\
The most important role\
of the Lord's prophet\
4:19\
is to teach us of the\
Savior and lead us to Him.\
4:24\
There are many logical reasons\
to follow President Russell M.\
4:29\
Nelson.\
4:30\
Even those not of our faith\
would call him brilliant.\
4:34\
As Elder Stevenson explained,\
he was a medical doctor\
4:38\
at age 22, an esteemed\
cardiac surgeon,\
4:41\
and a renowned pioneer\
in the development\
4:43\
of open-heart surgery.\
4:46\
Most would acknowledge\
his wisdom and judgment:\
4:49\
nine decades of learning\
about life and death,\
4:53\
living unselfishly, loving\
and teaching God's children\
4:57\
in every corner of the globe,\
and the maturing experiences\
5:02\
of having 10 children,\
57 grandchildren, and 117\
5:09\
great-grandchildren.\
5:10\
(This final number\
changes frequently.\
5:16\
A great-grandson was born\
this past Wednesday.)\
5:26\
Those who know him\
well would speak\
5:29\
of President Nelson facing\
the difficulties of life\
5:32\
with faith and courage.\
5:34\
When cancer took the life of\
his 37-year-old daughter, Emily,\
5:38\
leaving a loving husband\
and five small children,\
5:42\
I heard him say, "I was her\
father, a medical doctor,\
5:48\
and an Apostle of the\
Lord Jesus Christ,\
5:51\
but I had to bow my\
head and acknowledge,\
5:54\
'Not my will but\
thine be done.'"\
6:00\
Although we admire all\
of these noble qualities,\
6:04\
we follow President Nelson\
because the Lord Jesus Christ\
6:11\
has called him\
and designated him\
6:14\
as His watchman on the tower.\
6:18\
Carcassonne is a remarkable\
walled city in France that\
6:21\
has stood since medieval times.\
6:24\
Tall towers surge upward\
from its protected walls,\
6:29\
built for watchmen who stood\
on those towers day and night,\
6:33\
keeping their attention riveted\
in the distance for the enemy.\
6:38\
When the watchman saw\
an enemy approaching,\
6:42\
his warning voice protected\
the people of Carcassonne\
6:46\
from the impending danger\
they could not see.\
6:52\
A prophet is a\
watchman on the tower,\
6:56\
protecting us from spiritual\
dangers we may not see.\
7:04\
THE LORD SAID TO\
EZEKIEL: "I have\
7:06\
set thee a watchman unto\
the house of Israel;\
7:08\
therefore thou shalt hear\
the word [from] my mouth,\
7:12\
and warn them from me."\
7:15\
We often speak of our need\
to follow the prophet,\
7:19\
but consider this heavy burden\
the Lord places upon His\
7:22\
prophet: "If thou dost not\
speak to warn the wicked ... ,\
7:27\
[and] that wicked man ...\
die in his iniquity; ...\
7:32\
his blood will I\
require at thine hand."\
7:38\
We embrace President\
Nelson as we\
7:40\
would have embraced\
Peter or Moses\
7:42\
if we had lived in their day.\
7:44\
God told Moses, "I\
will be with thy mouth,\
7:49\
and teach thee what\
thou shalt say."\
7:52\
We listen to the Lord's\
prophet with the faith\
7:56\
that his words are "from\
[the Lord's] own mouth."\
8:01\
Is this blind faith?\
8:04\
No, it is not.\
8:06\
We each have a spiritual\
witness of the truthfulness\
8:10\
of the restoration of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
8:13\
By our own will and choice we\
raised our hand this morning,\
8:19\
declaring our desire to\
sustain the Lord's prophet with\
8:23\
our "confidence,\
faith, and prayer[s]"\
8:25\
and to follow his counsel.\
8:28\
We have the privilege\
as Latter-day Saints\
8:31\
to receive a personal witness\
that President Nelson's call is\
8:36\
from God.\
8:37\
While my wife, Kathy, has known\
President Nelson personally\
8:41\
for nearly three decades\
and has no question\
8:45\
about his divine mantle,\
upon his setting apart,\
8:49\
she began reading all his\
general conference talks\
8:53\
of the past 34 years, praying\
for an even deeper assurance\
8:58\
of his prophetic role.\
9:01\
I promise you that\
this greater witness\
9:05\
will come to you as you\
humbly and worthily seek it.\
9:11\
Why are we so willing to follow\
the voice of our prophet?\
9:15\
For those diligently\
seeking eternal life,\
9:19\
the prophet's voice\
brings spiritual safety\
9:23\
in very turbulent times.\
9:26\
We live on a planet clamoring\
with a million voices.\
9:29\
The internet, our\
smartphones, our bloated boxes\
9:34\
of entertainment all\
plead for our attention\
9:37\
and thrust their\
influence upon us,\
9:39\
hoping we will\
buy their products\
9:41\
and adopt their standards.\
9:45\
The seemingly endless array\
of information and opinion\
9:49\
remind us of the\
scriptural warnings\
9:51\
of being "tossed to and\
fro," "driven with the wind,"\
9:56\
and overcome by the "cunning\
craftiness" of those\
9:59\
who "lie in wait to deceive."\
10:03\
Anchoring our souls to\
the Lord Jesus Christ\
10:07\
requires listening\
to those He sends.\
10:11\
Following the prophet\
in a world of commotion\
10:15\
is like being wrapped in\
a soothing, warm blanket\
10:18\
on a freezing cold day.\
10:22\
We live in a world of reason,\
debate, argument, logic,\
10:27\
and explanation.\
10:29\
Questioning "Why?"\
is positive in so\
10:32\
many aspects of\
our lives, allowing\
10:35\
the power of our intellect to\
guide a multitude of choices\
10:39\
and decisions we face each day.\
10:43\
But the Lord's voice often\
comes without explanation.\
10:49\
Long before academics studied\
the impact of infidelity\
10:54\
upon trusting spouses and\
children, the Lord declared,\
10:59\
"Thou shalt not\
commit adultery."\
11:02\
Beyond the intellect\
alone, we treasure\
11:06\
the gift of the Holy Ghost.\
11:10\
The prophet's voice,\
while spoken kindly,\
11:13\
will often be a voice asking us\
to change, to repent and return\
11:18\
to the Lord.\
11:19\
When correction is\
needed, let's not delay.\
11:24\
And don't be alarmed when\
the prophet's warning\
11:27\
voice counters popular\
opinions of the day.\
11:30\
The mocking fireballs\
of annoyed disbelievers\
11:35\
are always hurled the moment\
the prophet begins to speak.\
11:41\
As you are humble in following\
the counsel of the Lord's\
11:44\
prophet, I promise you an added\
blessing of safety and peace.\
11:52\
Don't be surprised if at times\
your personal views are not\
11:55\
initially in harmony with\
the teachings of the Lord's\
11:58\
prophet.\
11:59\
These are moments of\
learning, of humility, when\
12:04\
we go to our knees in prayer.\
12:06\
We walk forward in\
faith, trusting in God,\
12:10\
knowing that with time we will\
receive more spiritual clarity\
12:14\
from our Heavenly Father.\
12:16\
One prophet described the\
incomparable gift of the Savior\
12:20\
as "the will of the\
Son being swallowed up\
12:24\
in the will of the Father."\
12:26\
The surrender of our\
will to God's will\
12:30\
is in fact not surrender\
at all but the beginning\
12:35\
of a glorious victory.\
12:38\
Some will try to overly dissect\
the prophet's words, struggling\
12:43\
to determine what is\
his prophetic voice\
12:46\
and what is his\
personal opinion.\
12:50\
In 1982, two years before being\
called as a General Authority,\
12:55\
Brother Russell M. Nelson\
said: "I never ask myself,\
13:01\
'When does the prophet speak\
as a prophet and when does he\
13:06\
not?'\
13:07\
My interest has been, 'How can\
I be more like him?'" He added,\
13:14\
"My [philosophy is to] stop\
putting question marks behind\
13:19\
the prophet's statements and\
put exclamation points instead."\
13:27\
This is how a humble\
and spiritual man\
13:31\
chose to order his life.\
13:33\
Now, 36 years later, he\
is the Lord's prophet.\
13:41\
In my personal\
life, I have found\
13:44\
that as I prayerfully study\
the words of the prophet of God\
13:47\
and carefully, with\
patience, spiritually\
13:51\
align my will with his\
inspired teachings,\
13:54\
my faith in the Lord Jesus\
Christ always increases.\
14:00\
If we choose to set his\
counsel aside and determine\
14:05\
that we know better,\
our faith suffers\
14:08\
and our eternal\
perspective is clouded.\
14:13\
I promise you that as you\
remain resolute in following\
14:17\
the prophet, your faith in\
the Savior will increase.\
14:23\
The Savior said,\
"All the prophets ...\
14:26\
have testified of me."\
14:29\
A prophet does not stand\
between you and the Savior.\
14:33\
Rather, he stands beside you and\
points the way to the Savior.\
14:40\
A prophet's greatest\
responsibility\
14:42\
and most precious gift to\
us is his sure witness,\
14:46\
his certain knowledge\
that Jesus is the Christ.\
14:51\
Like Peter of old, our prophet\
declares, "[He is] the Christ,\
14:57\
the Son of the living God."\
15:02\
In a future day, looking\
back on our mortality,\
15:07\
we will rejoice that we\
walked the earth at the time\
15:10\
of a living prophet.\
15:12\
At that day, I pray that\
we will be able to say:\
15:18\
We listened to him.\
15:20\
We believed him.\
15:22\
We studied his words\
with patience and faith.\
15:25\
We prayed for him.\
15:26\
We stood by him.\
15:28\
We were humble\
enough to follow him.\
15:32\
We loved him.\
15:37\
I leave my solemn\
witness that Jesus\
15:40\
is the Christ, our\
Redeemer and Savior,\
15:43\
and that President Russell M.\
Nelson is His anointed prophet\
15:48\
upon the earth.\
15:49\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
