My beloved brothers\
and sisters, as we\
0:03\
come to the close of\
this historic conference,\
0:05\
I join with you in thanking\
the Lord for His direction\
0:10\
and inspiring influence.\
0:12\
The music has been\
beautiful and uplifting.\
0:15\
Not only have the\
messages been edifying,\
0:19\
but they have been\
life-changing!\
0:23\
In solemn assembly we sustained\
a new First Presidency.\
0:27\
Two great men have been placed\
in the Quorum of the Twelve\
0:30\
Apostles.\
0:31\
Eight new General Authority\
Seventies have been called.\
0:36\
Now a favorite hymn summarizes\
our renewed resolve,\
0:40\
our challenge, and our\
charge going forward:\
0:45\
"Let us all press on in\
the work of the Lord,\
0:48\
That when life is o'er\
we may gain a reward;\
0:52\
In the fight for right\
let us wield a sword,\
0:57\
The mighty sword of truth.\
1:01\
Fear not, though\
the enemy deride;\
1:05\
Courage, for the\
Lord is on our side.\
1:10\
We will [not heed] what\
the wicked may say,\
1:14\
But the Lord alone\
we will obey."\
1:19\
I exhort you to study the\
messages of this conference\
1:22\
frequently--even\
repeatedly--during the next six\
1:26\
months.\
1:27\
Conscientiously look for ways\
to incorporate these messages\
1:31\
in your family home evenings,\
your gospel teaching,\
1:34\
your conversations with\
family and friends,\
1:37\
and even your discussions\
with those not of our faith.\
1:41\
Many good people will\
respond to the truths\
1:45\
taught in this conference\
when offered in love.\
1:49\
And your desire to\
obey will be enhanced\
1:52\
as you remember and\
reflect upon what you\
1:55\
have felt these past two days.\
1:59\
This general conference\
marks the beginning\
2:01\
of a new era of ministering.\
2:04\
The Lord has made\
important adjustments\
2:08\
in the way we care\
for each other.\
2:10\
Sisters and brothers--old and\
young--will serve one another\
2:15\
in a new, holier way.\
2:18\
Elders quorums will\
be strengthened\
2:21\
to bless the lives of\
men, women, and children\
2:23\
throughout the world.\
2:25\
Relief Society\
sisters will continue\
2:28\
to minister in their\
unique and loving way,\
2:31\
extending opportunities\
to younger sisters\
2:34\
to join them as\
appropriately assigned.\
2:40\
Our message to the world\
is simple and sincere:\
2:44\
we invite all of God's children\
on both sides of the veil\
2:49\
to come unto their\
Savior, receive\
2:54\
the blessings of the holy\
temple, have enduring joy,\
2:59\
and qualify for eternal life.\
3:04\
Eventual exaltation requires\
our complete fidelity now\
3:09\
to covenants we make and\
ordinances we receive\
3:13\
in the house of the Lord.\
3:17\
At this time, we have 159\
functioning temples and more\
3:22\
are under construction.\
3:23\
We want to bring temples\
closer to the expanding\
3:27\
membership of the Church.\
3:30\
So we are now pleased to\
announce plans to construct\
3:33\
seven more temples.\
3:41\
Those temples will be located in\
the following locations: Salta,\
3:46\
Argentina; Bengaluru,\
India; Managua, Nicaragua;\
3:57\
Cagayan de Oro,\
Philippines; Layton, Utah--\
4:02\
[LAUGHTER]\
4:14\
Richmond, Virginia--\
4:15\
[CHEERING]\
4:23\
[LAUGHTER]\
4:28\
And a major city yet to\
be determined in Russia.\
4:41\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
construction of these temples\
4:44\
may not change your life,\
but your time in the temple\
4:49\
surely will.\
4:52\
In that spirit, I\
bless you to identify\
4:56\
those things you can\
set aside so you can\
4:58\
spend more time in the temple.\
5:01\
I bless you with\
greater harmony and love\
5:04\
in your homes and\
a deeper desire\
5:07\
to care for your eternal\
family relationships.\
5:12\
I bless you with increased\
faith in the Lord Jesus\
5:15\
Christ and a greater\
ability to follow Him\
5:19\
as His true disciples.\
5:23\
I bless you to raise\
your voice in testimony,\
5:26\
as I do now, that we are engaged\
in the work of Almighty God!\
5:31\
Jesus is the Christ.\
5:34\
This is His Church,\
which He directs\
5:37\
through His anointed servants.\
5:39\
I so testify, with my expression\
of love for each of you,\
5:45\
in the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
