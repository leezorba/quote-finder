Dear brothers and sisters,\
when our sons were very young,\
0:06\
I told them bedtime stories\
about beagle puppies\
0:11\
and hummed bedtime hymns,\
including "Christ the Lord\
0:15\
Is Risen Today."\
0:17\
Sometimes I playfully\
changed the words:\
0:21\
"Now it's time to go\
to sleep, hallelujah!"\
0:27\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:32\
Usually our sons\
fell asleep quickly;\
0:35\
or at least they knew if I\
thought they were asleep,\
0:39\
I would stop singing.\
0:41\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:43\
Words--at least my words--cannot\
express the overwhelming\
0:49\
feelings since\
President Russell M.\
0:51\
Nelson lovingly took\
my hands in his,\
0:54\
with dear Susan at my side, and\
extended this sacred call from\
0:59\
the Lord that took my breath\
away and has left me weeping\
1:03\
many times these past days.\
1:06\
This Easter Sabbath, I\
joyfully sing, "Alleluia."\
1:10\
The song of our risen\
Savior's redeeming love\
1:14\
celebrates the\
harmony of covenants\
1:17\
(that connect us to\
God and to each other)\
1:20\
and the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ\
1:22\
(that helps us put off\
the natural man and woman\
1:25\
and yield to the enticings\
of the Holy Spirit).\
1:29\
Together, our covenants\
and our Savior's Atonement\
1:33\
enable and ennoble.\
1:35\
Together, they help\
us hold on and let go.\
1:38\
Together, they sweeten,\
preserve, sanctify, redeem.\
1:45\
Said the Prophet Joseph Smith:\
"It may seem to some to be\
1:49\
a very bold doctrine that\
we [speak] of--a power which\
1:53\
records or binds on earth\
and binds in heaven.\
1:55\
Nevertheless, in all\
ages of the world,\
2:00\
whenever the Lord has given a\
dispensation of the priesthood\
2:04\
to any man by actual\
revelation, or any set of men,\
2:08\
this power has\
always been given."\
2:12\
And so it is today.\
2:15\
Sacred covenants and ordinances,\
not available anywhere else,\
2:20\
are received in 159 holy houses\
of the Lord in 43 countries.\
2:26\
Promised blessings come through\
restored priesthood keys,\
2:29\
doctrine, and\
authority, reflecting\
2:32\
our faith, obedience, and the\
promises of His Holy Spirit\
2:36\
to us in our generations,\
in time and eternity.\
2:42\
Dear brothers and sisters\
in every nation, kindred,\
2:44\
and tongue, across\
our worldwide Church,\
2:47\
thank you for your living\
faith, hope, and charity\
2:51\
in every footstep.\
2:52\
Thank you for\
becoming a gathering\
2:55\
fulness of restored gospel\
testimony and experience.\
3:01\
Dear brothers and sisters,\
we belong to each other.\
3:03\
We can be "knit\
together in unity\
3:06\
and in love," in all\
things and in all places.\
3:10\
As the Lord Jesus Christ invites\
to each of us, wherever we are,\
3:16\
whatever our circumstance,\
please come and see.\
3:21\
This day I humbly pledge all\
the energies and faculties\
3:24\
of my soul, whatever\
they be or whatever\
3:27\
they may become, to\
my Savior, to my dear\
3:31\
Susan and our family,\
to my Brethren,\
3:35\
and to each of you, my\
beloved brothers and sisters.\
3:40\
Everything worthy and\
eternal is centered\
3:42\
in the living reality of God,\
our loving Eternal Father,\
3:46\
and His Son, Jesus Christ,\
and His Atonement, witnessed\
3:50\
by the Holy Ghost.\
3:53\
This is Easter Sunday.\
3:55\
I reverently witness and\
solemnly testify of the living\
3:59\
Christ--He who\
"died, was buried,\
4:02\
and rose again the third day,\
and ascended into heaven."\
4:06\
He is Alpha and Omega--with\
us in the beginning,\
4:11\
He is with us to the end.\
4:14\
I testify of\
latter-day prophets,\
4:17\
from the Prophet Joseph Smith\
to our dear President Russell M.\
4:20\
Nelson, whom we\
joyfully sustain.\
4:23\
As our Primary children\
sing, "Follow the prophet;\
4:27\
he knows the way."\
4:29\
And as prophesied in\
the holy scriptures,\
4:31\
including in the Book of Mormon,\
I witness "the Lord's kingdom\
4:35\
[is] once again\
... on the earth,\
4:37\
preparatory to the Second\
Coming of the Messiah."\
4:40\
In the holy and sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
