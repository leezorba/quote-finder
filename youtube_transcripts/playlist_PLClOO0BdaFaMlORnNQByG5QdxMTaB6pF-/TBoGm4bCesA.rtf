My beloved brethren, we have\
heard a revelatory announcement\
0:08\
from President\
Russell M. Nelson.\
0:11\
We have heard\
important elaborations\
0:14\
by Elders Christofferson\
and Rasband\
0:17\
and by President Eyring.\
0:21\
What will yet be said, including\
more from President Nelson,\
0:27\
will elaborate what\
you, the Lord's leaders\
0:31\
and priesthood holders, will\
now do in your responsibilities.\
0:36\
To help with that, I will review\
some fundamental principles\
0:41\
governing the\
priesthood you hold.\
0:45\
The Melchizedek Priesthood is\
the divine authority God has\
0:48\
delegated to accomplish His\
work "to bring to pass the ...\
0:53\
eternal life of man."\
0:56\
In 1829 it was conferred upon\
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery\
1:01\
by the Savior's Apostles\
Peter, James, and John.\
1:06\
It is sacred and powerful\
beyond our powers to describe.\
1:13\
The keys of the\
priesthood are the powers\
1:15\
to direct the exercise\
of priesthood authority.\
1:20\
Thus, when the Apostles\
conferred the Melchizedek\
1:25\
Priesthood upon\
Joseph and Oliver,\
1:28\
they also gave them the\
keys to direct its exercise.\
1:33\
But not all priesthood keys\
were conferred at that time.\
1:38\
The entire keys and\
knowledge necessary\
1:42\
for this "dispensation\
of the fulness of times"\
1:47\
are given "line upon line."\
1:50\
Additional keys were given\
in the Kirtland Temple\
1:54\
seven years later.\
1:56\
These keys were given to\
direct priesthood authority\
2:00\
in the additional\
assignments being\
2:02\
given at that time, such\
as baptism for the dead.\
2:08\
The Melchizedek Priesthood\
is not a status or a label.\
2:12\
It is a divine\
power held in trust\
2:17\
to use for the benefit of\
God's work for His children.\
2:22\
We should always\
remember that men\
2:25\
who hold the priesthood\
are not "the priesthood."\
2:29\
It is not appropriate to\
refer to "the priesthood\
2:33\
and the women."\
2:34\
We should refer to "the\
holders of the priesthood\
2:38\
and the women."\
2:42\
Now let us consider what the\
Lord Jesus Christ expects from\
2:46\
those who hold His\
priesthood--how we are to bring\
2:49\
souls unto Him.\
2:52\
President Joseph\
F. Smith taught:\
2:56\
"It has truly been said that the\
Church is perfectly organized.\
3:01\
The only trouble is that\
these organizations are not\
3:05\
fully alive to the obligations\
that rest upon them.\
3:09\
When they become\
thoroughly [acquainted]\
3:12\
to the requirements\
made of them,\
3:15\
they will fulfill their\
duties more faithfully,\
3:18\
and the work of the Lord\
will be all the stronger\
3:21\
and more powerful and\
influential in the world."\
3:28\
PRESIDENT SMITH ALSO CAUTIONED:\
"The God-given titles of honor\
3:32\
... associated with the\
several offices in and orders\
3:36\
of the Holy Priesthood, are not\
to be used or considered as are\
3:41\
the titles originated by man;\
they are not for adornment nor\
3:46\
are they expressive\
of mastership,\
3:49\
but rather of appointment to\
humble service in the work\
3:54\
of the one Master whom\
we profess [or] serve."\
4:00\
CONTINUING THE QUOTE:\
"We are laboring\
4:02\
for the salvation\
of souls, and we\
4:04\
should feel that this is\
the greatest duty devolving\
4:09\
upon us.\
4:10\
Therefore, we should\
feel willing to sacrifice\
4:13\
everything, if need be,\
for the love of God,\
4:17\
the salvation of men, and the\
triumph of the kingdom of God\
4:22\
upon the earth."\
4:27\
In the Lord's\
Church, the offices\
4:29\
in the Melchizedek Priesthood\
have different functions.\
4:33\
The Doctrine and Covenants\
refers to high priests\
4:36\
as "standing presidents or\
servants over different stakes\
4:43\
scattered abroad."\
4:45\
It refers to elders as "standing\
ministers to my church."\
4:54\
Here are other teachings on\
these separate functions.\
4:58\
A high priest officiates\
and administers\
5:00\
in spiritual things.\
5:02\
Also, as President\
Joseph F. Smith taught,\
5:06\
"Inasmuch as he has been\
ordained a high priest,\
5:11\
[he] should feel that\
he is obliged ...\
5:13\
to set an example before the old\
and young worthy of emulation,\
5:19\
and to place himself in a\
position to be a teacher\
5:22\
of righteousness, not only by\
precept but more particularly\
5:27\
by example--giving to the\
younger ones the benefit\
5:32\
of the experience of age, and\
thus becoming individually\
5:36\
a power in the midst of the\
community in which he dwells."\
5:44\
On the duties of an\
elder, Elder Bruce R.\
5:47\
McConkie of the Quorum\
of the Twelve taught:\
5:49\
"An elder is a minister of\
the Lord Jesus Christ. ...\
5:53\
He is commissioned to stand\
in the place and stead of his\
5:58\
Master ... in ministering\
to his fellowmen.\
6:01\
He is the Lord's agent."\
6:06\
Elder McConkie\
criticized the idea\
6:08\
that one is "only an elder."\
6:11\
"Every elder in the Church\
holds as much priesthood\
6:14\
as the President of\
the Church," he said.\
6:17\
"What is an elder?\
6:18\
He is a shepherd, a shepherd\
serving in the sheepfold\
6:23\
of the Good Shepherd."\
6:25\
In this important\
function to minister\
6:30\
in the sheepfold of\
the Good Shepherd,\
6:32\
there is no distinction between\
the offices of high priest\
6:37\
and elder in the\
Melchizedek Priesthood.\
6:41\
In the great section 107 of\
the Doctrine and Covenants,\
6:46\
the Lord declares, "High\
priests after the order\
6:54\
of the Melchizedek\
Priesthood have a right\
6:57\
to officiate in\
their own standing,\
7:00\
under the direction\
of the presidency,\
7:02\
in administering\
spiritual things,\
7:05\
and also in the office of\
an elder [or any office\
7:12\
in the Aaronic Priesthood]."\
7:16\
The most important principle\
for all priesthood holders\
7:19\
is the principle taught by the\
Book of Mormon prophet Jacob.\
7:23\
After he and his brother\
Joseph were consecrated\
7:27\
priests and teachers of\
the people, he declared,\
7:31\
"And we did magnify our\
office unto the Lord,\
7:35\
taking upon us the\
responsibility, answering\
7:39\
the sins of the people\
upon our own heads\
7:42\
if we did not teach\
them the word of God\
7:45\
with all diligence."\
7:49\
Brethren, our responsibilities\
as holders of the priesthood\
7:54\
are serious matters.\
7:56\
Other organizations\
can be satisfied\
8:00\
with worldly standards\
of performance\
8:02\
in delivering their\
messages and performing\
8:06\
their other functions.\
8:07\
But we who hold the\
priesthood of God\
8:11\
have the divine power\
that even governs entrance\
8:14\
into the celestial\
kingdom of God.\
8:17\
We have the purpose\
and the responsibility\
8:21\
the Lord defined in\
the revealed preface\
8:24\
to the Doctrine and Covenants.\
8:26\
We are to proclaim to the world:\
8:30\
"That every man might\
speak in the name of God\
8:32\
the Lord, even the\
Savior of the world;\
8:36\
"That faith also might\
increase in the earth;\
8:39\
"That mine everlasting\
covenant might be established;\
8:43\
"That the fulness of\
my gospel might be\
8:45\
proclaimed by the weak\
and the simple unto\
8:48\
the ends of the world."\
8:52\
To fulfill this\
divine charge, we\
8:54\
must be faithful in "magnifying"\
our priesthood callings\
8:59\
and responsibilities.\
9:02\
Elder Harold B.\
Lee explained what\
9:05\
it means to magnify\
the priesthood:\
9:07\
"When one becomes a\
holder of the priesthood,\
9:10\
he becomes an agent of the Lord.\
9:12\
He should think of his\
calling as though he\
9:16\
were on the Lord's errand.\
9:17\
[This] is what it means to\
magnify the priesthood."\
9:24\
Therefore, brethren, if the Lord\
Himself were to ask you to help\
9:29\
one of His sons or\
daughters--which He has done\
9:33\
through His\
servants--would you do it?\
9:36\
And if you did, would\
you act as His agent,\
9:40\
"on the Lord's errand,"\
relying on His promised help?\
9:47\
Elder Lee had another\
teaching about magnifying\
9:49\
the priesthood: "When you hold a\
magnifying glass over something\
9:54\
it makes that thing\
look bigger than you\
9:56\
could see it with the naked\
eye; that's a magnifying glass.\
10:01\
Now, ... if anybody magnified\
their priesthood--that is,\
10:04\
makes it bigger than they\
first thought it was and more\
10:09\
important than anyone else\
thought it was--that is the way\
10:13\
you magnify your priesthood."\
10:15\
Here is an example of a\
priesthood holder magnifying\
10:21\
his priesthood responsibility.\
10:24\
I heard this from Elder Jeffrey\
D. Erekson, my companion\
10:29\
in a stake conference in Idaho.\
10:32\
As a young married elder,\
desperately poor and feeling\
10:36\
unable to finish his\
last year of college,\
10:39\
Jeffrey decided to drop out and\
accept an attractive job offer.\
10:45\
A few days later his\
elders quorum president\
10:48\
came to his home.\
10:53\
"Do you understand\
the significance\
10:55\
of the priesthood keys I hold?"\
10:58\
the elders quorum\
president asked.\
11:02\
When Jeffrey said he\
did, the president\
11:04\
told him that since\
hearing of his intention\
11:08\
to drop out of college,\
the Lord had tormented him\
11:12\
during sleepless nights to\
give Jeffrey this message:\
11:16\
"As your elders\
quorum president,\
11:19\
I counsel you not to\
drop out of college.\
11:22\
That is a message to\
you from the Lord."\
11:28\
Jeffrey stayed in school.\
11:31\
[LAUGHTER]\
11:34\
Years later I met him as\
a successful businessman\
11:37\
and heard him tell an audience\
of priesthood holders,\
11:41\
"That [counsel] has made all\
the difference in my life."\
11:48\
A priesthood holder magnified\
his priesthood and calling,\
11:53\
and that made "all the\
difference" in the life\
11:56\
of another child of God.\
12:00\
Up to now, I have been\
speaking of the functions\
12:03\
of the priesthood in the Church.\
12:05\
Now I will speak of\
priesthood in the family.\
12:09\
I begin with keys.\
12:11\
The principle that\
priesthood authority can only\
12:14\
be exercised under the\
direction of the one who\
12:18\
holds the keys for that function\
is fundamental in the Church\
12:24\
but does not apply\
to the exercise\
12:27\
of priesthood authority\
in the family.\
12:29\
A father who holds\
the priesthood\
12:32\
presides in his family\
by the authority\
12:36\
of the priesthood he holds.\
12:38\
He has no need to have\
the direction or approval\
12:41\
of priesthood keys\
in order to counsel\
12:44\
the members of his family,\
hold family meetings,\
12:48\
give priesthood blessings\
to his wife and children,\
12:52\
or to give healing blessings\
to family members or others.\
12:57\
If fathers would magnify their\
priesthood in their own family,\
13:02\
it would further the mission of\
the Church as much as anything\
13:06\
else they might do.\
13:09\
Fathers who hold the\
Melchizedek Priesthood\
13:11\
should keep the\
commandments so they\
13:14\
will have the power of the\
priesthood to give blessings\
13:18\
to their family members.\
13:20\
Fathers should also cultivate\
loving family relationships\
13:25\
so that family members\
will want to ask\
13:29\
their fathers for blessings.\
13:31\
And parents should encourage\
more priesthood blessings\
13:36\
in the family.\
13:39\
Fathers, function as "equal\
partners" of your wives,\
13:43\
as the family\
proclamation teaches.\
13:47\
And fathers, when you are\
privileged to exercise\
13:51\
the power and influence of\
your priesthood authority,\
13:56\
do so "by persuasion,\
by long-suffering,\
14:00\
by gentleness and meekness,\
and by love unfeigned."\
14:07\
That high standard\
for the exercise\
14:09\
of priesthood authority is\
most important in the family.\
14:15\
President Harold B.\
Lee gave this promise\
14:18\
just after he became\
President of the Church:\
14:23\
"Never is the power of the\
priesthood, which you hold,\
14:26\
more wonderful than when there\
is a crisis in your home,\
14:30\
a serious illness, or some great\
decision that has to be made.\
14:35\
...\
14:36\
Vested in the power\
of the priesthood,\
14:39\
which is the power\
of Almighty God,\
14:42\
is the power to perform miracles\
if the Lord wills it so,\
14:46\
but in order for us to\
use that priesthood,\
14:50\
we must be worthy\
to exercise it.\
14:54\
A failure to understand\
this principle\
14:57\
is a failure to receive\
the blessings of holding\
15:01\
that great priesthood."\
15:06\
My beloved brethren,\
the magnifying\
15:09\
of the holy\
priesthood you hold is\
15:11\
vital to the work of the\
Lord in your families\
15:15\
and in your Church callings.\
15:18\
I testify of Him whose\
priesthood it is.\
15:22\
Through His atoning suffering\
and sacrifice and Resurrection,\
15:27\
all men and women have the\
assurance of immortality\
15:32\
and the opportunity\
for eternal life.\
15:35\
Each of us should be faithful\
and diligent in doing\
15:40\
our part in this great work\
of God, our Eternal Father.\
15:45\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
