My brothers and sisters,\
I rejoice with you today\
0:06\
for the experience\
we have had together\
0:09\
in this great conference.\
0:11\
I am grateful for\
the opportunity\
0:15\
to speak to you on\
the Lord's Sabbath\
0:19\
in the general conference of His\
Church at this Easter season.\
0:26\
I thank our Heavenly\
Father for the gift\
0:29\
of His Beloved Son,\
who came voluntarily\
0:34\
to earth to be our Redeemer.\
0:37\
I am grateful to know that\
He atoned for our sins\
0:42\
and rose in the Resurrection.\
0:45\
Every day I am blessed to know\
that because of His Atonement,\
0:53\
I may someday be\
resurrected to live forever\
0:57\
in a loving family.\
1:01\
I know those things by the only\
way any of us can know them.\
1:08\
The Holy Ghost has spoken to\
my mind and heart that they are\
1:14\
true--not just once but often.\
1:20\
I have needed that\
continuing comfort.\
1:24\
We all experience tragedy,\
during which we need\
1:28\
the reassurance of the Spirit.\
1:31\
I felt it one day as I stood\
with my father in a hospital.\
1:35\
We watched my mother take a few\
shallow breaths--and then no\
1:40\
more.\
1:41\
As we looked on her face, she\
was smiling as the pain left.\
1:47\
After a few silent moments,\
my father spoke first.\
1:52\
He said, "A little\
girl has gone home."\
1:57\
He said it softly.\
1:58\
He seemed to be at\
peace, almost joyful.\
2:02\
He was reporting something\
he knew was true.\
2:07\
He quietly began to gather\
Mother's personal things.\
2:11\
He went out into\
the hospital hallway\
2:14\
to thank each of the\
nurses and doctors who\
2:17\
had ministered to her for days.\
2:21\
My father had the\
companionship of the Holy Ghost\
2:25\
at that moment to feel, to know,\
and do what he did that day.\
2:32\
He had received the\
promise as many have:\
2:36\
"That they may have his\
Spirit to be with them."\
2:40\
My simple hope\
today is to increase\
2:44\
your desire and your ability\
to receive the Holy Ghost.\
2:50\
Remember, He is the third\
member of the Godhead.\
2:53\
The Father and the Son\
are resurrected beings.\
2:56\
The Holy Ghost is\
a person of spirit.\
3:00\
It is your choice whether to\
receive Him and welcome Him\
3:05\
into your heart and mind.\
3:08\
The conditions on which we can\
receive that supernal blessing\
3:11\
are made clear in the words\
that are spoken every week\
3:15\
but perhaps do not always sink\
into our hearts and minds.\
3:18\
To have the Spirit\
sent to us, we\
3:21\
must "always\
remember" the Savior\
3:24\
and "keep his commandments."\
3:26\
This time of year helps us\
remember the Savior's sacrifice\
3:30\
and His rising from the\
tomb a resurrected being.\
3:34\
Many of us hold those images of\
those scenes in our memories.\
3:39\
I once stood with my wife\
outside a tomb in Jerusalem.\
3:44\
Many believe that\
it was the tomb\
3:46\
from which the crucified\
Savior emerged as a resurrected\
3:51\
and living God.\
3:54\
The respectful guide that\
day motioned with his hand\
3:57\
and said to us, "Come,\
see an empty tomb."\
4:02\
We stooped to enter.\
4:04\
We saw a stone bench\
against a wall.\
4:08\
But in my mind came\
another picture, as real\
4:13\
as what we saw that day.\
4:15\
It was of Mary, who was left\
by the Apostles at the tomb.\
4:20\
That is what the Spirit let me\
see and even hear in my mind,\
4:26\
as clearly as if\
I had been there:\
4:30\
"But Mary stood without\
at the sepulchre weeping:\
4:34\
and as she wept,\
she stooped down,\
4:36\
and looked into the sepulchre,\
4:39\
"And seeth two angels in white\
sitting, the one at the head,\
4:44\
and the other at the feet, where\
the body of Jesus had lain.\
4:49\
"And they say unto her,\
Woman, why weepest thou?\
4:54\
She saith unto them, Because\
they have taken away my Lord,\
4:58\
and I know not where\
they have laid him.\
5:01\
"And when she had thus said,\
she turned herself back,\
5:05\
and saw Jesus standing, and\
knew not that it was Jesus.\
5:13\
"Jesus saith unto her,\
Woman, why weepest thou?\
5:16\
whom seekest thou?\
5:18\
She, supposing him to be the\
gardener, saith unto him, Sir,\
5:23\
if thou have borne\
him hence, tell me\
5:26\
where thou hast laid him,\
and I will take him away.\
5:30\
"Jesus saith unto her, Mary.\
5:35\
She turned herself,\
and saith unto him,\
5:38\
Rabboni; which is\
to say, Master.\
5:44\
"Jesus saith unto\
her, Touch me not;\
5:46\
for I am not yet ascended to my\
Father: but go to my brethren,\
5:50\
and say unto them, I ascend\
unto my Father, and your Father;\
5:55\
and to my God, and your God."\
6:00\
I have prayed to be allowed\
to feel something of what Mary\
6:04\
felt at the tomb as she\
recognized the Savior,\
6:09\
and what two other disciples\
felt on the road to Emmaus\
6:13\
as they walked with\
the resurrected Savior,\
6:16\
thinking Him a\
visitor to Jerusalem.\
6:20\
You remember the account:\
6:22\
"But they constrained\
him, saying,\
6:24\
Abide with us: for\
it is toward evening,\
6:27\
and the day is far spent.\
6:29\
And he went in to\
tarry with them.\
6:33\
"And it came to pass, as\
he sat at meat with them,\
6:35\
he took bread, and blessed it,\
and brake, and gave to them.\
6:41\
"And their eyes were\
opened, and they knew him;\
6:45\
and he vanished\
out of their sight.\
6:48\
"And they said one\
to another, Did\
6:50\
not our heart burn within\
us, while he talked\
6:55\
with us by the way, and while\
he opened to us the scriptures?"\
7:01\
Some of those\
words were repeated\
7:03\
in a sacrament\
meeting I attended\
7:05\
more than 70 years ago.\
7:07\
In those ancient days\
sacrament meetings\
7:10\
were held, sometimes,\
in the evening.\
7:13\
It was dark outside.\
7:15\
The congregation sang\
these familiar words.\
7:18\
I had heard them many times.\
7:21\
But my lasting memory\
is of a feeling on one\
7:25\
particular night.\
7:27\
It draws me closer\
to the Savior.\
7:31\
Perhaps if I recite the words,\
it will come to all of us\
7:35\
again:\
7:36\
"Abide with me; 'tis eventide.\
7:38\
The day is past and gone;\
7:40\
The shadows of the evening fall;\
7:42\
The night is coming on.\
7:47\
Within my heart a welcome guest,\
7:52\
Within my home abide.\
7:54\
"Abide with me; 'tis eventide.\
7:56\
Thy walk today with me\
7:59\
Has made my heart\
within me burn,\
8:03\
As I communed with thee.\
8:05\
Thy earnest words\
have filled my soul\
8:08\
And kept me near thy side.\
8:09\
"O Savior, stay\
this night with me;\
8:13\
Behold, 'tis eventide.\
8:16\
O Savior, stay\
this night with me;\
8:19\
Behold, 'tis eventide."\
8:23\
More precious than a memory or\
a picture of the events of that\
8:29\
day--more important is the\
memory of the Holy Ghost\
8:33\
touching our hearts and\
His continuing affirmation\
8:38\
of truth.\
8:39\
More precious than\
seeing with our eyes,\
8:43\
or remembering words\
spoken and read,\
8:45\
is recalling the\
feelings that accompanied\
8:49\
the quiet voice of the Spirit.\
8:52\
Rarely, I have felt it exactly\
as the travelers on the road\
8:57\
to Emmaus did--as a soft but\
clear burning in the heart.\
9:03\
More often, it is a feeling\
of light and quiet assurance.\
9:09\
We have the priceless promise of\
the Holy Ghost as a companion,\
9:15\
and we also have true directions\
on how to claim that gift.\
9:21\
These words are said by the\
Lord's authorized servant\
9:25\
with his hands on our head:\
"Receive the Holy Ghost."\
9:31\
At that moment, you and I have\
the assurance He will be sent.\
9:36\
But our obligation\
is to choose to open\
9:40\
our hearts to receive\
the ministration\
9:43\
of the Spirit over a lifetime.\
9:46\
The experiences of the Prophet\
Joseph Smith offer a guide.\
9:49\
He began and continued his\
ministry with the decision\
9:53\
that his own wisdom was\
not sufficient to know\
9:57\
what course he should pursue.\
9:59\
He chose to be\
humble before God.\
10:04\
Next, Joseph chose\
to ask of God.\
10:09\
He prayed in faith\
that God would answer.\
10:13\
The answer came when\
he was a young boy.\
10:15\
Those messages\
came when he needed\
10:17\
to know how God would have\
His Church established.\
10:21\
The Holy Ghost comforted and\
guided him throughout his life.\
10:26\
He obeyed inspiration\
when it was difficult.\
10:30\
For instance, he\
received direction\
10:32\
to send the Twelve to England\
when he needed them most.\
10:36\
He sent them.\
10:38\
He accepted correction and\
comfort from the Spirit\
10:41\
when he was imprisoned and the\
Saints were terribly oppressed.\
10:45\
And he obeyed when\
he went down the road\
10:48\
to Carthage even as he knew\
he faced mortal danger.\
10:53\
The Prophet Joseph\
set an example for us\
10:56\
of how to receive continual\
spiritual direction and comfort\
11:01\
through the Holy Ghost.\
11:03\
The first choice he made\
was to be humble before God.\
11:08\
The second was to pray with\
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.\
11:12\
The third was to obey exactly.\
11:15\
Obedience may mean\
to move quickly.\
11:18\
It may mean to prepare.\
11:21\
Or it may mean to\
wait in patience\
11:24\
for further inspiration.\
11:27\
And the fourth is\
to pray to know\
11:29\
the needs and the\
hearts of others\
11:31\
and how to help\
them for the Lord.\
11:34\
Joseph prayed for the Saints in\
distress when he was in prison.\
11:40\
It has been my opportunity to\
observe the prophets of God\
11:45\
as they pray, ask\
for inspiration,\
11:48\
receive direction,\
and act on it.\
11:50\
I have seen how\
often their prayers\
11:54\
are about the people\
they love and serve.\
11:57\
Their concern for others\
seems to open their hearts\
12:01\
to receive inspiration.\
12:03\
That can be true for you.\
12:08\
Inspiration will\
help us minister\
12:09\
to others for the Lord.\
12:11\
You have seen that in your\
own experience, as I have.\
12:15\
My bishop once said to me--at\
a time when my wife was under\
12:19\
great strain in her\
own life--he said,\
12:23\
"Every time I hear of someone\
in the ward who needs help,\
12:26\
when I get there to help, I find\
that your wife was there ahead\
12:29\
of me.\
12:30\
How does she do that?"\
12:32\
[LAUGHTER]\
12:34\
Well, she is like all who are\
great ministers in the Lord's\
12:39\
kingdom.\
12:40\
It seems there are\
two things they do.\
12:42\
Great ministers have\
qualified for the Holy Ghost\
12:46\
as a nearly constant companion.\
12:49\
And they have qualified for\
the gift of charity, which\
12:53\
is the pure love of Christ.\
12:55\
Those gifts have\
grown in them as they\
12:58\
have used them in serving\
out of love for the Lord.\
13:03\
The way in which prayer,\
inspiration, and love\
13:07\
of the Lord work together\
in our service to Him\
13:10\
is described for me\
perfectly in these words:\
13:15\
"If ye shall ask any thing\
in my name, I will do it.\
13:20\
"If ye love me, keep\
my commandments.\
13:23\
"And I will pray\
the Father, and he\
13:26\
shall give you\
another Comforter,\
13:28\
that he may abide\
with you for ever;\
13:32\
"Even the Spirit of truth;\
whom the world cannot receive,\
13:36\
because it seeth him\
not, neither knoweth him:\
13:40\
but ye know him; for he dwelleth\
with you, and shall be in you.\
13:48\
"I will not leave\
you comfortless:\
13:50\
I will come to you.\
13:52\
"Yet a little while, and\
the world seeth me no more;\
13:55\
but ye see me: because I\
live, ye shall live also.\
14:01\
"At that day ye shall know\
that I am in my Father,\
14:04\
and ye in me, and I in you.\
14:09\
"He that hath my commandments,\
and keepeth them, he it\
14:12\
is that loveth me:\
and he that loveth\
14:14\
me shall be loved of my\
Father, and I will love him,\
14:18\
and will manifest\
myself to him."\
14:23\
I bear my personal witness that\
the Father is at this moment\
14:27\
aware of you, your feelings,\
and the spiritual and temporal\
14:31\
needs of everyone around you.\
14:34\
I bear testimony that\
the Father and the Son\
14:37\
are sending the Holy Ghost\
to all who have that gift\
14:43\
and ask for that blessing\
and seek to be worthy of it.\
14:48\
Neither the Father, nor the\
Son, nor the Holy Ghost force\
14:54\
Themselves into our lives.\
14:56\
We are free to choose.\
14:59\
The Lord has said to all:\
15:02\
"Behold, I stand at\
the door, and knock:\
15:05\
if any man hear my\
voice, and open the door,\
15:08\
I will come in to him, and will\
sup with him, and he with me.\
15:13\
"To him that\
overcometh will I grant\
15:15\
to sit with me in my\
throne, even as I also\
15:19\
overcame, and am set down\
with my Father in his throne.\
15:24\
"He that hath an ear, let him\
hear what the Spirit saith."\
15:31\
I pray with all\
my heart that you\
15:32\
will hear the voice\
of the Spirit, which\
15:35\
is sent to you so generously.\
15:37\
And I pray that you will\
open your hearts always\
15:41\
to receive Him.\
15:43\
If you ask with real\
intent and with faith\
15:45\
in Jesus Christ for\
inspiration, you\
15:48\
will receive it in the\
Lord's way and in His time.\
15:53\
God did that for the\
young Joseph Smith.\
15:56\
He does it today for our living\
prophet, President Russell M.\
16:00\
Nelson.\
16:01\
He has placed you in the\
way of other children of God\
16:05\
to serve them for Him.\
16:08\
I know that not only by what\
I have seen with my eyes\
16:13\
but more powerfully\
by what the Spirit has\
16:16\
whispered to my heart.\
16:20\
I have felt the love of the\
Father and of His Beloved Son\
16:28\
for all the children\
of God in the world\
16:31\
and for His children\
in the spirit world.\
16:34\
I have felt the comfort and the\
direction of the Holy Ghost.\
16:38\
I pray that you may have the joy\
of having the Spirit with you\
16:43\
as your companion constantly.\
16:47\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
