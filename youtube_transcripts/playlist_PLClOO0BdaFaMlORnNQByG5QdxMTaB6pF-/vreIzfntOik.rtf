While preparing for\
the construction\
0:03\
of the magnificent\
Paris France Temple,\
0:06\
I had an experience\
I will never forget.\
0:09\
In 2010, when property\
for the temple was found,\
0:14\
the city mayor asked\
to meet with us\
0:16\
to know more about our Church.\
0:19\
This meeting was a critical step\
in obtaining a building permit.\
0:23\
We meticulously\
prepared a presentation\
0:26\
that included several impressive\
pictures of Latter-day Saint\
0:30\
temples.\
0:31\
My most fervent hope was that\
their architectural beauty\
0:36\
would persuade the mayor\
to support our project.\
0:41\
To my surprise,\
the mayor indicated\
0:43\
that rather than reviewing our\
presentation, he and his team\
0:47\
preferred to conduct their\
own investigation to find out\
0:51\
what kind of church we were.\
0:53\
The following month,\
we were invited back\
0:56\
to hear a report given\
by a city councilor who\
1:00\
also happened to be a\
professor of religious history.\
1:04\
She said, "Above\
all else, we wanted\
1:07\
to understand who the\
members of your church are.\
1:11\
First, we attended one of\
your sacrament meetings.\
1:15\
We sat at the back of the\
chapel and carefully observed\
1:19\
the people in the congregation\
and what they were doing.\
1:23\
Then we met with your\
neighbors--those who live\
1:26\
around your stake center--and we\
asked them what kind of people\
1:31\
you Mormons are."\
1:33\
"So what are your conclusions?"\
1:36\
I asked, feeling a\
little bit of anxiety.\
1:40\
She replied, "We discovered\
that The Church of Jesus Christ\
1:45\
of Latter-day Saints is the\
closest to Jesus Christ's\
1:49\
original Church than any\
other church we know of."\
1:52\
I almost objected by\
saying, "That's not\
1:55\
completely accurate!\
1:57\
It's not the church\
that is closest;\
1:59\
it is the Church of Jesus\
Christ--the same Church,\
2:03\
the true Church!"\
2:05\
But I restrained myself\
and instead offered\
2:08\
a silent prayer of gratitude.\
2:10\
The mayor then advised us\
that, based on their findings,\
2:15\
he and his team had no\
objections to the construction\
2:18\
of a temple in their community.\
2:22\
Today, when I think about\
that miraculous experience,\
2:25\
I feel grateful for the\
mayor's wisdom and spirit\
2:28\
of discernment.\
2:30\
He knew that the key to\
understanding the Church\
2:33\
is not to see it through\
the outward appearance\
2:36\
of its buildings or even as\
a well-organized institution\
2:41\
but through its millions\
of faithful members, who\
2:45\
strive each day to follow\
the example of Jesus Christ.\
2:50\
The definition of\
the Church might\
2:52\
be derived from a passage in\
the Book of Mormon that states:\
2:56\
"And they [meaning\
the Lord's disciples]\
2:59\
who were baptized\
in the name of Jesus\
3:02\
were called the\
church of Christ."\
3:06\
In other words, the Church\
is all about people.\
3:08\
It is all about you, the Lord's\
disciples--those who love\
3:13\
and follow Him and who have\
taken His name upon them\
3:16\
by covenant.\
3:19\
President Russell M. Nelson\
once likened the Church\
3:21\
to a nice automobile.\
3:23\
We all love it when our\
vehicle is clean and shiny.\
3:27\
But the car's purpose\
is not to stand out\
3:31\
as an attractive machine; it is\
to move the people in the car.\
3:36\
In the same manner, we\
as members of the Church\
3:39\
appreciate having beautiful\
places of worship that\
3:43\
are clean and well\
maintained, and we also\
3:46\
enjoy having\
well-functioning programs.\
3:49\
But these are merely\
support systems.\
3:53\
Our sole aim is to invite\
each son and daughter of God\
3:57\
to come unto Christ and to guide\
him or her along the covenant\
4:02\
path.\
4:02\
Nothing is more important.\
4:05\
Our work is all about\
people and covenants.\
4:10\
Isn't it wonderful that the\
name given by revelation\
4:13\
to the restored\
Church binds together\
4:15\
the two most important elements\
in each gospel covenant?\
4:20\
First is the name Jesus Christ.\
4:24\
This Church belongs to Him,\
and His sanctifying Atonement\
4:28\
and covenants are\
the only pathway\
4:31\
to salvation and exaltation.\
4:33\
The second name refers\
to us: the Saints,\
4:37\
or in other words, His\
witnesses and His disciples.\
4:42\
I learned the\
importance of focusing\
4:44\
on people when I served as\
a stake president in France.\
4:48\
At the beginning\
of my service, I\
4:50\
had in mind some very\
ambitious goals for the stake:\
4:54\
the creation of new wards, the\
building of new meetinghouses,\
4:59\
and even the construction\
of a temple in our area.\
5:04\
When I was released\
six years later,\
5:07\
not one of these objectives\
had been achieved.\
5:10\
This could have felt like a\
complete failure except that,\
5:15\
during the course\
of those six years,\
5:17\
my objectives had\
become quite different.\
5:22\
As I sat on the stand on\
the day of my release,\
5:25\
I was overwhelmed by a\
profound sense of gratitude\
5:29\
and accomplishment.\
5:31\
I looked at the faces of\
the hundreds of members\
5:33\
in attendance.\
5:35\
I could recall a spiritual\
experience connected\
5:37\
with each one of them.\
5:39\
There were those\
brothers and sisters\
5:42\
who had entered the waters\
of baptism, those for whom\
5:47\
I had signed their first\
recommends so they could\
5:50\
receive the sacred\
ordinances of the temple,\
5:53\
and those young\
people and couples\
5:55\
I had set apart or released\
as full-time missionaries.\
5:59\
There were many others\
to whom I had ministered\
6:03\
as they were going through\
trials and adversity\
6:06\
in their lives.\
6:07\
I felt intense brotherly\
love for each of them.\
6:11\
I had found pure\
joy in serving them\
6:14\
and rejoiced in their\
increased loyalty and faith\
6:17\
to the Savior.\
6:20\
President M. Russell\
Ballard taught,\
6:23\
"What is most important in our\
Church responsibilities is not\
6:28\
the statistics that are reported\
or the meetings that are held\
6:32\
but whether or not individual\
people--ministered to one\
6:37\
at a time just as the\
Savior did--have been lifted\
6:42\
and encouraged and\
ultimately changed."\
6:47\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
are we active in the gospel,\
6:51\
or are we merely\
busy in the Church?\
6:55\
The key is to follow the example\
of the Savior in all things.\
6:59\
If we do that, we\
will naturally focus\
7:02\
on saving individuals\
rather than performing tasks\
7:07\
and implementing programs.\
7:10\
Have you ever\
asked yourself what\
7:11\
it would be like if the\
Savior visited your ward\
7:14\
or branch next Sunday?\
7:16\
What would He do?\
7:18\
Would He be worried to know\
if the visual aids were\
7:22\
good enough or if the chairs\
were positioned properly\
7:26\
in the classroom?\
7:27\
Or would He find someone He\
could love, teach, and bless?\
7:32\
Perhaps He would seek out a new\
member or a friend to welcome,\
7:36\
a sick brother or sister\
in need of comfort,\
7:39\
or a wavering young\
person who needed\
7:42\
to be lifted and encouraged.\
7:46\
What classes would Jesus visit?\
7:48\
I wouldn't be surprised if He\
visited the Primary children\
7:51\
first.\
7:52\
He would probably kneel down\
and speak to them eye to eye.\
7:56\
He would express\
His love to them,\
7:59\
tell them stories, congratulate\
them on their drawings,\
8:02\
and testify of His\
Father in Heaven.\
8:06\
His attitude would\
be simple, genuine,\
8:10\
and without affectation.\
8:12\
Can we do likewise?\
8:15\
I promise you that as you strive\
to be on the Lord's agenda,\
8:18\
nothing will become more\
important than finding\
8:23\
those people you\
can help and bless.\
8:26\
At church you will focus\
on teaching individuals\
8:29\
and touching their hearts.\
8:31\
Your concern will be to\
foster a spiritual experience\
8:36\
rather than organize\
a perfect activity,\
8:39\
to minister to\
your fellow members\
8:41\
rather than checking a box\
for the number of visits\
8:44\
you have made.\
8:45\
It will not be about\
you but about them\
8:49\
whom we call our\
brothers and our sisters.\
8:54\
Sometimes we talk\
about going to church.\
8:57\
But the Church is more than a\
building or a particular place.\
9:01\
It is just as real and alive\
in the humblest of dwellings\
9:05\
in the most remote\
areas of the world\
9:08\
as it is here at Church\
headquarters in Salt Lake City.\
9:12\
The Lord Himself said,\
"For where two or three\
9:16\
are gathered\
together in my name,\
9:19\
there am I in the\
midst of them."\
9:23\
We take the Church\
with us wherever\
9:25\
we go: to work, to school,\
on vacation, and especially\
9:29\
in our homes.\
9:31\
Our very presence\
and influence can\
9:33\
be enough to make wherever we\
find ourselves a holy place.\
9:41\
I remember a conversation\
I had with a friend\
9:43\
who is not a member\
of our faith.\
9:46\
He was surprised to learn that\
any worthy man in our Church\
9:50\
could receive the priesthood.\
9:52\
He asked, "But how\
many priesthood holders\
9:56\
do you have in your ward?"\
9:58\
I answered, "Between 30 and 40."\
10:01\
Perplexed, he continued,\
"In my congregation,\
10:04\
we only have one priest.\
10:06\
Why do you need so many\
priests on Sunday morning?"\
10:12\
Intrigued by his\
question, I felt\
10:14\
inspired to reply,\
"I agree with you.\
10:17\
I don't think we need that\
many priesthood holders\
10:20\
at church on Sunday.\
10:21\
But we do need a priesthood\
holder in every home.\
10:26\
And when there is no\
priesthood in a home,\
10:29\
other priesthood holders are\
called upon to watch over\
10:32\
and minister to that family."\
10:35\
Ours is not just\
a Sunday church.\
10:38\
Our worship continues each day\
of the week, wherever we are\
10:42\
and in whatever we do.\
10:44\
Our homes in particular are\
"the primary sanctuaries\
10:48\
of our faith."\
10:50\
It is most often in\
our homes that we pray,\
10:53\
that we bless, we study,\
we teach the word of God,\
10:57\
and we serve with pure love.\
10:59\
I can testify from personal\
experience that our homes are\
11:04\
sacred places where the\
Spirit can abound--as much\
11:08\
as, and sometimes\
even more than,\
11:11\
in our formal places of worship.\
11:14\
I bear witness that this Church\
is the Church of Jesus Christ.\
11:19\
Its strength and vitality\
come from the daily actions\
11:23\
of millions of His\
disciples who strive\
11:26\
each day to follow His supreme\
example by caring for others.\
11:31\
Christ lives, and He\
directs this Church.\
11:35\
President Russell M.\
Nelson is the prophet\
11:38\
whom He has chosen to lead\
and guide us in our days.\
11:42\
Of these things I testify in\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
