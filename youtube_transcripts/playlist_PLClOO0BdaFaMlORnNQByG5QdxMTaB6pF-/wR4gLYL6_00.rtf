Thank you, Brother Holmes,\
for your important message.\
0:05\
Dear brethren, we deeply miss\
President Thomas S. Monson\
0:11\
and Elder Robert D. Hales.\
0:13\
Yet we all press on in\
the work of the Lord.\
0:18\
I am very grateful for each man\
who bears the holy priesthood.\
0:21\
You are the hope of\
our Redeemer, who\
0:24\
desires "that every man might\
speak in the name of God\
0:29\
the Lord, even the\
Savior of the world."\
0:31\
He wants all of His ordained\
sons to represent Him,\
0:38\
to speak for Him,\
to act for Him,\
0:41\
and bless the lives\
of God's children\
0:44\
throughout the world to the\
end that "faith also might\
0:48\
increase in [all] the earth."\
0:52\
Some of you serve where\
the Church has been\
0:54\
established for generations.\
0:57\
Others serve where the\
Church is relatively new.\
1:01\
For some, your wards are large.\
1:04\
For others, your branches are\
small and distances are great.\
1:09\
Regardless of your individual\
circumstances, each of you\
1:13\
is a member of a priesthood\
quorum with a divine mandate\
1:18\
to learn and to teach, to\
love and to serve others.\
1:25\
Tonight we announce a\
significant restructuring\
1:29\
of our Melchizedek\
Priesthood quorums\
1:33\
to accomplish the work of\
the Lord more effectively.\
1:39\
In each ward, the high\
priests and the elders\
1:44\
will now be combined\
into one elders quorum.\
1:52\
This adjustment will\
greatly enhance the capacity\
1:55\
and the ability of men who bear\
the priesthood to serve others.\
2:01\
Prospective elders will be\
welcomed in and fellowshipped\
2:05\
by that quorum.\
2:08\
In each stake, the\
stake presidency\
2:11\
will continue to preside over\
the stake high priests quorum.\
2:15\
But the composition\
of that quorum\
2:18\
will be based on current\
priesthood callings,\
2:23\
as will be explained later.\
2:27\
Elder D. Todd Christofferson\
and Elder Ronald A. Rasband\
2:30\
of the Quorum of\
the Twelve Apostles\
2:32\
will now teach us more about\
these important adjustments.\
2:37\
These modifications have been\
under study for many months.\
2:41\
We have felt a pressing\
need to improve\
2:44\
the way we care for\
our members and report\
2:47\
our contacts with them.\
2:49\
To do that better,\
we need to strengthen\
2:52\
our priesthood quorums\
to give greater direction\
2:55\
to the ministering\
of love and support\
2:58\
that the Lord intends\
for His Saints.\
3:02\
These adjustments are\
inspired of the Lord.\
3:05\
As we implement them, we will\
be even more effective than we\
3:08\
have ever been previously.\
3:11\
We are engaged in the\
work of Almighty God.\
3:14\
Jesus is the Christ!\
3:16\
We are His humble servants!\
3:18\
God bless you, brethren, as\
we learn of and do our duty,\
3:23\
I pray in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
