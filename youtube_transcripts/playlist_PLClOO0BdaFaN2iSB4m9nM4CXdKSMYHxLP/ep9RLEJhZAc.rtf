Thank you, dear President\
Oaks, for that most important\
0:04\
message.\
0:07\
My dear brothers and\
sisters, what a privilege\
0:10\
it is to stand before you today.\
0:12\
United with those\
who have already\
0:14\
addressed this conference,\
I testify to you\
0:17\
that Jesus Christ lives.\
0:19\
He directs His Church; He\
speaks to His prophet, President\
0:24\
Russell M. Nelson, and He loves\
all Heavenly Father's children.\
0:31\
On this Easter Sunday, we\
commemorate the Resurrection\
0:34\
of Jesus Christ, our Savior\
and Redeemer, the Mighty\
0:38\
God, the Prince of Peace.\
0:41\
His Atonement, culminating\
with His Resurrection\
0:45\
after three days\
in a borrowed tomb,\
0:47\
stands as the greatest\
miracle in human history.\
0:52\
"For behold," He\
pronounced, "I am God;\
0:56\
and I am a God of miracles."\
1:00\
"Have miracles ceased\
because Christ hath ascended\
1:03\
into heaven, and hath sat down\
on the right hand of God?"\
1:07\
the prophet Mormon asked\
in the Book of Mormon.\
1:11\
He answers, "Nay; neither have\
angels ceased to minister unto\
1:16\
the children of men."\
1:19\
Following the Crucifixion,\
an angel of the Lord\
1:22\
appeared to Mary, who,\
with a few other women,\
1:25\
had gone to the tomb to\
anoint the body of Jesus.\
1:29\
The angel said: "Why seek ye\
the living among the dead?"\
1:34\
"He is not here:\
for he is risen."\
1:38\
The Book of Mormon prophet\
Abinadi proclaimed of that\
1:42\
miracle: "If Christ had not\
risen from the dead, ...\
1:45\
there could have\
been no resurrection.\
1:49\
But there is a resurrection,\
therefore the grave\
1:53\
hath no victory, and\
the sting of death\
1:56\
is swallowed up in Christ."\
2:00\
The miraculous acts\
of Jesus Christ\
2:02\
caused the early disciples to\
exclaim, "What manner of man\
2:07\
is this!\
2:08\
for he commandeth even the winds\
and water, and they obey him."\
2:14\
As the early Apostles\
followed Jesus Christ\
2:17\
and heard Him teach the gospel,\
they witnessed many miracles.\
2:22\
They saw "the blind\
receive their sight,\
2:25\
and the lame walk, [and]\
lepers are cleansed,\
2:29\
and the deaf hear, the\
dead are raised up,\
2:33\
and the poor have the\
gospel preached to them."\
2:37\
Miracles, signs,\
and wonders abound\
2:41\
among followers of Jesus\
Christ today, in your lives\
2:46\
and in mine.\
2:48\
Miracles are divine\
acts, manifestations,\
2:52\
and expressions of\
God's limitless power,\
2:56\
and an affirmation that He is\
"the same yesterday, today,\
3:01\
and forever."\
3:04\
Jesus Christ, who created\
the seas, can calm them.\
3:08\
He who gave sight to the blind\
can lift our sights to heaven.\
3:14\
He who cleansed the lepers\
can mend our infirmities.\
3:19\
He who healed the\
impotent man can\
3:22\
call for us to rise up\
with "Come, follow me."\
3:28\
Many of you have\
witnessed miracles,\
3:30\
more than you realize.\
3:32\
They may seem\
small in comparison\
3:35\
to Jesus raising the dead.\
3:37\
But the magnitude does\
not distinguish a miracle,\
3:41\
only that it came from God.\
3:45\
Some suggest miracles are simply\
coincidences or sheer luck.\
3:50\
But the prophet\
Nephi condemned those\
3:53\
who would "put down the\
power and miracles of God,\
3:57\
and preach up unto\
themselves their own wisdom\
4:01\
and their own learning,\
that they may get gain."\
4:05\
Miracles are wrought\
by divine power\
4:08\
by He who is "mighty to save."\
4:10\
Miracles are extensions\
of God's eternal plan;\
4:14\
miracles are a lifeline\
from heaven to earth.\
4:20\
Last fall, Sister Rasband\
and I were on our way\
4:23\
to Goshen, Utah, for a\
worldwide Face to Face,\
4:27\
an event being broadcast\
to over 600,000 people\
4:31\
in 16 different languages.\
4:34\
The program was to focus on\
the events of the Restoration\
4:38\
of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ, with questions\
4:42\
submitted by young adults\
from around the world.\
4:46\
Sister Rasband and\
I had personally\
4:48\
reviewed the questions;\
they gave us the opportunity\
4:51\
to testify of Joseph\
Smith as a prophet of God,\
4:56\
the power of revelation\
in our lives,\
4:58\
ongoing restoration of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ,\
5:03\
and truths and commandments\
that we treasure.\
5:07\
Many listening today were\
part of that miraculous event.\
5:12\
Initially, the broadcast was to\
originate in the Sacred Grove\
5:17\
in upstate New York, where\
Joseph Smith testified:\
5:22\
"I saw two Personages,\
whose brightness and glory\
5:25\
defy all description,\
standing above me in the air.\
5:29\
One of them spake unto me,\
calling me by name and said,\
5:33\
pointing to the other--This\
is My Beloved Son.\
5:37\
Hear Him!"\
5:39\
That, brothers and\
sisters, was a miracle.\
5:43\
The worldwide pandemic forced\
us to relocate the broadcast\
5:47\
to Goshen, Utah, where\
The Church of Jesus\
5:51\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
has re-created, for filming,\
5:55\
a section of old Jerusalem.\
5:58\
Sister Rasband and I were\
within a few miles of Goshen\
6:02\
that Sunday evening\
when we saw thick\
6:05\
smoke coming from the\
direction of our destination.\
6:09\
Wildfires were\
blazing in the area,\
6:12\
and we worried the\
broadcast might be at risk.\
6:16\
Sure enough, at\
20 minutes to six,\
6:19\
our broadcast time, the power\
in the entire complex went out.\
6:25\
No power, no broadcast.\
6:29\
There was one\
generator that some\
6:32\
thought we might be\
able to power up,\
6:34\
but there was no\
assurance it could\
6:36\
sustain the sophisticated\
equipment at hand.\
6:40\
All of us on the\
program--including narrators,\
6:44\
musicians, and technicians, even\
20 young adults from our own\
6:49\
extended family--were fully\
invested in what was to take\
6:53\
place.\
6:55\
I stepped away from\
their tears and confusion\
6:59\
and pleaded with the\
Lord for a miracle.\
7:05\
"Heavenly Father," I\
prayed, "I have rarely\
7:08\
asked for a miracle, but\
I am asking for one now.\
7:12\
This meeting must happen\
for all our young adults\
7:16\
around the world.\
7:17\
We need the power to go\
on if it be Thy will."\
7:24\
Seven minutes after\
six, as quickly\
7:26\
as the power had gone\
out, it came back on.\
7:29\
Everything started working,\
from the music and microphones\
7:33\
to the videos and all the\
transmission equipment.\
7:37\
We were off and running.\
7:40\
We had experienced a miracle.\
7:44\
As Sister Rasband and I were\
in the car returning home\
7:47\
later that evening,\
President and Sister Nelson\
7:51\
texted us with this\
message: "Ron, we\
7:55\
want you to know that as soon\
as we heard the power was out,\
7:58\
we prayed for a miracle."\
8:02\
In latter-day scripture it\
is written, "For I, the Lord,\
8:06\
have put forth my hand to\
exert the powers of heaven;\
8:10\
ye cannot see it now, yet a\
little while and ye shall see\
8:14\
it, and know that I am, and ...\
8:16\
I will come and reign\
with my people."\
8:21\
That is exactly what happened.\
8:22\
The Lord had put forth His\
hand, and the power came on.\
8:28\
Miracles are worked\
through the power of faith,\
8:32\
as President Nelson\
so powerfully\
8:34\
taught us in the last session.\
8:37\
The prophet Moroni\
exhorted the people,\
8:39\
"If there be no faith\
among the children of men\
8:43\
God can do no\
miracle among them;\
8:46\
wherefore, he showed not himself\
until after their faith."\
8:51\
He continues: "Behold, it was\
the faith of Alma and Amulek\
8:56\
that caused the prison\
to tumble to the earth.\
8:59\
Behold, it was the\
faith of Nephi and Lehi\
9:03\
that wrought the change\
upon the Lamanites,\
9:06\
that they were baptized with\
fire and with the Holy Ghost.\
9:11\
Behold, it was the faith of\
Ammon and his brethren which\
9:14\
wrought so great a miracle\
among the Lamanites. ...\
9:17\
And neither at any time\
hath any wrought miracles\
9:21\
until after their faith;\
wherefore they first\
9:26\
believed in the Son of God."\
9:29\
I could add to that\
sequence of scriptures,\
9:33\
"It was the faith of earnest\
young adult performers,\
9:36\
broadcast professionals,\
Church leaders and members,\
9:40\
an Apostle, and a prophet of God\
that sought so great a miracle\
9:45\
that the power was restored\
to a remote movie set\
9:50\
in Goshen, Utah."\
9:53\
Miracles can come as\
answers to prayers.\
9:56\
They are not always what we\
ask for or what we expect,\
10:00\
but when we trust in the\
Lord, He will be there,\
10:04\
and He will be right.\
10:06\
He will suit the miracle\
to the moment we need it.\
10:10\
The Lord performs miracles\
to remind us of His power,\
10:14\
His love for us, His\
reach from the heavens\
10:18\
to our mortal experience,\
and His desire\
10:22\
to teach of that which\
is of most worth.\
10:26\
"He that hath faith\
in me to be healed,"\
10:29\
He said to the Saints in\
1831--and the promise continues\
10:34\
today--"and is not appointed\
unto death, shall be healed."\
10:40\
There are laws decreed\
in the heavens,\
10:42\
and we are always\
subject to them.\
10:45\
There are times we hope for a\
miracle to heal a loved one,\
10:49\
to reverse an\
unjust act or soften\
10:52\
the heart of a bitter\
or disillusioned soul.\
10:56\
Looking at things\
through mortal eyes,\
10:59\
we want the Lord to intervene,\
to fix what is broken.\
11:03\
Through faith, the\
miracle will come,\
11:07\
though not necessarily\
on our timetable\
11:10\
or with the\
resolution we desired.\
11:13\
Does that mean we are\
less than faithful\
11:16\
or do not merit\
His intervention?\
11:19\
No.\
11:20\
We are beloved of the Lord.\
11:22\
He gave His life for\
us, and His Atonement\
11:25\
continues to release\
us from burdens and sin\
11:29\
as we repent and\
draw close to Him.\
11:33\
The Lord has reminded us,\
"Neither are your ways\
11:37\
my ways."\
11:38\
He offers, "Come unto me, all\
ye that labour and are heavy\
11:43\
laden, and I will\
give you rest."\
11:46\
Rest from worry, disappointment,\
fear, disobedience,\
11:52\
concern for loved ones,\
for lost or broken dreams.\
11:57\
Peace amidst confusion\
or sorrow is a miracle.\
12:03\
REMEMBER THE LORD'S WORDS: "Did\
I not speak peace to your mind\
12:07\
concerning the matter?\
12:08\
What greater witness can\
you have than from God?"\
12:13\
The miracle is that Jesus\
Christ, the Great Jehovah,\
12:17\
the Son of the Highest,\
is responding with peace.\
12:21\
Just as He appeared\
to Mary in the garden,\
12:24\
calling her by name, He calls\
to us to exercise our faith.\
12:29\
Mary was looking to serve\
Him and care for Him.\
12:32\
His Resurrection was\
not what she expected,\
12:35\
but it was according to the\
great plan of happiness.\
12:39\
"Come down from the cross,"\
the crowd of nonbelievers\
12:42\
jeered at Him on Calvary.\
12:45\
He could have performed\
such a miracle.\
12:47\
But He knew the end\
from the beginning,\
12:49\
and he intended to be\
faithful to his Father's plan.\
12:53\
That example should\
not be lost on us.\
12:58\
To us in times of trial He has\
said, "Behold the wounds which\
13:02\
pierced my side, and also\
the prints of the nails\
13:05\
in my hands and feet; be\
faithful, keep my commandments,\
13:10\
and ye shall inherit\
the kingdom of heaven."\
13:12\
That, brothers and\
sisters, is the miracle\
13:16\
promised to all of us.\
13:18\
On this Easter Sunday,\
as we celebrate\
13:22\
the miracle of our\
Lord's Resurrection,\
13:24\
as an Apostle of\
Jesus Christ, I humbly\
13:28\
pray that you will feel\
the power of the Redeemer\
13:31\
in your life, that your\
appeals to our Heavenly Father\
13:35\
will be answered with the love\
and commitment Jesus Christ\
13:39\
demonstrated throughout\
His ministry.\
13:43\
I pray that you may stand\
steadfast and faithful in all\
13:48\
that is to come, and I bless you\
that miracles will attend you\
13:53\
as we experienced in Goshen--if\
it be the Lord's will.\
14:00\
Look for these heaven-sent\
blessings in your life\
14:04\
as you "seek this Jesus of whom\
the prophets and apostles have\
14:09\
written, that the grace\
of God the Father,\
14:12\
and also the Lord Jesus\
Christ, and the Holy Ghost,\
14:16\
which beareth\
record of them, may\
14:19\
be and abide in you forever."\
14:22\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
