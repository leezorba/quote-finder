Brothers and sisters,\
I rejoice with you\
0:02\
in the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
0:04\
I bring with me love\
from the resilient\
0:06\
members in the Philippines and\
say, on their behalf, Mabuhay!\
0:10\
On this Easter morning, I\
testify of the Living Christ,\
0:13\
that He rose from the\
dead, and that His love\
0:15\
for us and for our Father in\
Heaven is pure and eternal.\
0:18\
Today, I desire to focus\
on the love of Heavenly\
0:21\
Father and Jesus\
Christ for all, which\
0:23\
is manifest through the\
Atonement of His Son, Jesus\
0:26\
Christ.\
0:27\
"For God so loved the world that\
he gave his only begotten Son."\
0:31\
When the prophet Nephi was asked\
by an angel about his knowledge\
0:34\
of God, Nephi\
responded simply, "I\
0:37\
know that he loveth\
his children."\
0:39\
A verse from the Book of\
Mormon: Another Testament\
0:42\
of Jesus Christ, powerfully\
describes the Savior's\
0:44\
perfect love: "And the world,\
because of their iniquity,\
0:47\
shall judge him to be a thing\
of naught; they scourge him,\
0:51\
they smite him,\
they spit upon him,\
0:54\
and he suffereth it,\
because of his loving\
0:56\
kindness and his long-suffering\
towards the children of men."\
1:00\
The Savior's universal love is\
the motivating force behind all\
1:03\
that he does.\
1:04\
We know that it is the same\
love our Father in Heaven\
1:06\
has for us, because the\
Savior humbly taught that He\
1:10\
and the Father "are one."\
1:12\
How, then, do we reciprocate\
and show our gratitude\
1:15\
for their universal love?\
1:16\
The Savior taught us with\
this simple, all-encompassing\
1:19\
invitation: "If ye love\
me keep my commandments."\
1:24\
President Dallin H. Oaks taught:\
"God's universal and perfect\
1:28\
love is shown in all the\
blessings of His gospel plan,\
1:31\
including the fact that His\
choicest blessings are reserved\
1:34\
for those who obey His laws."\
1:36\
I would like to share three\
specific ways our Heavenly\
1:40\
Father manifests his love\
for us, His children.\
1:43\
First, relationships with God\
and family manifest His love.\
1:47\
Our most valuable relationships\
are with the Father and the Son\
1:50\
and with our own families\
because our ties to them\
1:53\
are eternal.\
1:55\
The great plan of happiness\
is a wonderful manifestation\
1:58\
of God's love for us.\
1:59\
With eyes rivetted on\
God's plan we willingly\
2:02\
choose to carve out soil\
and rocks within us that\
2:05\
support selfish desires\
and replace them\
2:08\
with foundations that build\
eternal relationships.\
2:11\
In a sense, this can be\
called "spiritual excavation."\
2:15\
In performing our\
spiritual excavation,\
2:17\
we must first seek after\
God and call upon Him.\
2:20\
Seeking after Him and calling\
upon Him will begin the process\
2:24\
and provide space to\
build and strengthen\
2:26\
our eternal relationships.\
2:28\
It broadens our\
spiritual view and helps\
2:30\
us focus on changing what we\
can control rather than on fears\
2:34\
outside our control.\
2:37\
Studying the life and ministry\
of our Savior, Jesus Christ,\
2:40\
will enable us to view\
these other concerns\
2:42\
with an eternal perspective.\
2:44\
Distractions can\
sometimes prevent us\
2:47\
from experiencing God's love\
in our family relationships\
2:49\
and activities.\
2:51\
A mother feeling\
that gadgets were\
2:53\
taking over her\
family relationships\
2:55\
came up with a solution.\
2:57\
At the dinner table and\
at other family times,\
3:00\
she just calls out,\
"Phones on the deck;\
3:02\
let us have face time."\
3:05\
She says that this is the\
new norm for their family\
3:08\
and that it strengthens their\
relationship as a family when\
3:11\
they have real face time.\
3:13\
They now enjoy quality\
Come, Follow Me discussions\
3:16\
together as a family.\
3:17\
Second, He manifests\
His love to His children\
3:21\
by calling prophets.\
3:22\
Our current world is deluged\
in a "war of words and tumult\
3:25\
of opinions."\
3:27\
Paul reminds us\
that, "there are so\
3:29\
many kinds of voices\
in the world."\
3:31\
Which of all the voices rise\
clearly and meaningfully\
3:35\
above the fray?\
3:35\
It is the voice\
of God's prophets,\
3:38\
seers, and revelators.\
3:40\
I remember vividly after\
undergoing surgery in 2018,\
3:44\
upon returning to work, I\
was in the parking garage\
3:46\
at Church headquarters.\
3:48\
Suddenly, I heard the voice\
of President Russell M. Nelson\
3:51\
calling, "Taniela, Taniela."\
3:53\
I ran toward him, and he\
asked how I was doing.\
3:57\
I said, "I am recovering\
very well, President Nelson."\
4:01\
He gave me counsel and a hug.\
4:03\
I truly felt the personal\
ministry of a prophet\
4:06\
to the "one."\
4:08\
President Nelson has traveled\
to many nations of the earth.\
4:11\
In my mind, he is not just\
ministering to thousands\
4:14\
but he is ministering\
to thousands of "ones."\
4:17\
In doing so, he shares the love\
God has for all His children.\
4:21\
Recently, the words\
of President Nelson\
4:23\
have been a source of\
strength and inspiration\
4:25\
to the people of\
the Philippines.\
4:27\
As with every\
country in the world,\
4:29\
during 2020 the Philippines\
was severely affected\
4:33\
by the COVID-19\
pandemic, as well as\
4:36\
a volcanic eruption,\
earthquakes, typhoons,\
4:39\
and devastating floods.\
4:40\
But, like a pillar\
of light shining\
4:42\
through dark clouds\
of fear, loneliness,\
4:44\
and despair came the\
words of the prophet.\
4:47\
It included the call for\
worldwide fasting and prayer\
4:50\
and counsel to move forward\
despite the pandemic.\
4:54\
He invited us to make our homes\
personal sanctuaries of faith.\
4:58\
He called upon Latter-day\
Saints everywhere\
5:00\
to respect all of God's\
children and to let\
5:02\
God prevail in our lives.\
5:05\
Likewise stirring was President\
Nelson's recent video testimony\
5:08\
about the power of\
gratitude--and his concluding\
5:11\
prayer resonated\
across the Philippines.\
5:14\
The Philippines, along\
with the entire world,\
5:17\
are so blessed to feel\
God's love through the words\
5:20\
of His chosen prophet.\
5:22\
Third, chastening can\
be a manifestation\
5:25\
of God's love for His children.\
5:27\
Sometimes God manifests\
His love by chastening us.\
5:30\
It is a way of reminding\
us that He loves us\
5:33\
and that He knows who we are.\
5:35\
His promised\
blessing of peace is\
5:37\
open to all those\
who courageously\
5:39\
walk the covenant path and are\
willing to receive correction.\
5:43\
When we recognize the chastening\
and are willing recipients,\
5:46\
it becomes a spiritual surgery.\
5:48\
Who likes surgery by the way?\
5:50\
But to those who need it and\
are willing to receive it,\
5:53\
it can be\
5:54\
lifesaving.\
5:55\
The Lord chastens whom He loves.\
5:57\
The scriptures tell us so.\
5:59\
That chastening, or\
spiritual surgery,\
6:01\
will bring about needed\
change in our lives.\
6:05\
Joseph Smith, the Prophet of\
the Restoration, was chastened.\
6:08\
After losing the 116 pages of\
the Book of Mormon manuscript,\
6:12\
the Lord both corrected\
and showed love\
6:14\
by saying: "You should not\
have feared man more than God.\
6:18\
...\
6:18\
You should have been faithful.\
6:19\
...\
6:20\
Behold thou art Joseph,\
and thou wast chosen.\
6:23\
Remember, God is merciful;\
therefore, repent."\
6:27\
In 2016 while serving a mission\
in Little Rock, Arkansas,\
6:31\
I asked Brother Cava to deliver\
a package to my older sister\
6:34\
who lived on an island in Fiji.\
6:36\
His response was not something\
that I had anticipated.\
6:40\
"President Wakolo" he\
groaned, "your sister\
6:43\
passed away and was\
buried 10 days ago."\
6:46\
I had self-pity and\
even felt a little upset\
6:50\
that my family did not\
even bother to let me know.\
6:53\
The next day, while my wife\
was teaching missionaries,\
6:56\
this thought penetrated\
my soul: "Taniela,\
6:59\
all these experiences are for\
your own good and development.\
7:03\
You have been\
teaching and sharing\
7:04\
your testimony about the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ;\
7:07\
now live accordingly."\
7:09\
I was reminded that "happy\
is the man whom God corrects;\
7:13\
therefore [we should] despise\
7:14\
not [the] chastening\
of the Almighty."\
7:16\
It was a spiritual\
surgery for me,\
7:19\
and the outcome was immediate.\
7:21\
Just as I was contemplating\
the experience,\
7:24\
I was called upon to give\
my concluding thoughts\
7:26\
to the discussion.\
7:27\
Among other things,\
I shared the lessons\
7:29\
that I had just been taught:\
one, I had just been chastened\
7:33\
by the Holy Ghost,\
and I loved it\
7:35\
because I was the\
only one who heard it;\
7:38\
two, because of the Savior's\
sacrifice and ransom,\
7:42\
I will no longer\
refer to my challenges\
7:44\
as trials and tribulations,\
but as my learning experiences;\
7:47\
and three, because of His\
perfect and sinless life,\
7:52\
I will no longer refer to\
my shortcomings and lack\
7:54\
of abilities as weaknesses,\
but rather as my development\
7:57\
opportunities.\
7:59\
This experience helped me\
know that God chastens us\
8:02\
because He loves us.\
8:04\
I conclude, our Eternal Father\
and His Son, Jesus Christ,\
8:07\
show their love by\
making it possible\
8:09\
for us to have eternal\
relationships with Them\
8:12\
and our family members, by\
calling modern-day prophets\
8:15\
to teach and minister\
to us, and by chastening\
8:18\
us to help us learn and grow.\
8:20\
God be thanked for\
the matchless gift\
8:22\
of His Divine Son,\
our resurrected Lord,\
8:25\
even the Living Christ.\
8:27\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
