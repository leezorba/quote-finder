My dear brethren,\
fellow servants\
0:05\
in the priesthood of God,\
it is an honor for me\
0:09\
to speak to you tonight.\
0:11\
You have my deepest\
respect and gratitude.\
0:16\
When I speak with you and\
hear of your great faith,\
0:21\
it is my belief that there is\
an ever-increasing priesthood\
0:25\
power in the world, with\
ever-stronger quorums\
0:30\
and ever-more faithful\
priesthood holders.\
0:35\
In my few moments\
this evening, I\
0:38\
will speak to those\
of you who want\
0:41\
to be even more effective\
in your personal priesthood\
0:46\
service.\
0:47\
You know of the\
charge that you are\
0:49\
to magnify your call to serve.\
0:53\
But you may wonder what\
"to magnify your calling"\
0:58\
can mean for you.\
1:01\
I will start with the\
newest deacons, because they\
1:05\
are most likely to feel\
uncertain about what\
1:09\
magnifying their priesthood\
service might mean.\
1:13\
Newly ordained elders\
might also want to listen,\
1:17\
and a bishop in his\
first weeks of service\
1:20\
might be interested too.\
1:24\
It is instructive for me, at\
least, to look back on my days\
1:29\
as a deacon.\
1:30\
I wish that someone had told me\
then what I will suggest now.\
1:37\
It could have helped in all\
the priesthood assignments that\
1:41\
have come to me since\
then--even the ones I receive\
1:47\
in the present day.\
1:51\
I was ordained a deacon\
in a branch so small\
1:55\
that I was the only\
deacon and my brother\
1:59\
Ted the only teacher.\
2:01\
We were the only\
family in the branch.\
2:05\
The entire branch\
met in our home.\
2:09\
The priesthood leader\
for my brother and me\
2:13\
was a new convert\
who had just received\
2:16\
the priesthood himself.\
2:18\
I believe then my\
only priesthood duty\
2:22\
was to pass the sacrament\
in my own dining room.\
2:27\
When my family moved to Utah,\
I found myself in a large ward\
2:33\
with many deacons.\
2:36\
In my first sacrament\
meeting there,\
2:39\
I observed the deacons--an army,\
it seemed to me--moving with\
2:43\
precision as they passed the\
sacrament like a trained team.\
2:50\
I was so frightened,\
the next Sunday I\
2:52\
went early to the ward\
building to be by myself\
2:56\
when no one could see me.\
2:59\
If I remember right, it was the\
Yale Crest ward in Salt Lake\
3:03\
City, and it had a\
little--some sort of a statue;\
3:07\
I went behind the statue.\
3:09\
I prayed fervently\
for help to know\
3:13\
how not to fail as I\
took my place in passing\
3:18\
of the sacrament.\
3:19\
Well, that prayer was answered.\
3:22\
But I know now that\
there is a better way\
3:25\
to pray and to think\
as we try to grow\
3:29\
in our priesthood service.\
3:32\
It has come by my\
understanding why individuals\
3:38\
are given the priesthood.\
3:43\
The purpose for our\
receiving the priesthood\
3:45\
is to allow us to bless\
people for the Lord,\
3:50\
doing so in His name.\
3:54\
It was years after I was\
a deacon when I learned\
3:58\
what that means practically.\
4:01\
For instance, as\
a high priest, I\
4:04\
was assigned to visit a\
care-center sacrament meeting.\
4:08\
I was asked to\
pass the sacrament.\
4:11\
Instead of thinking about\
the process or precision\
4:15\
in the way I passed\
the sacrament,\
4:18\
I instead looked in the\
faces of each elderly person.\
4:24\
I saw many of them weeping.\
4:29\
One lady grabbed my sleeve,\
looked up, and said aloud,\
4:33\
"Oh, thank you, thank you."\
4:37\
The Lord had blessed my\
service given in His name.\
4:42\
That day I had prayed for\
such a miracle to come.\
4:46\
Instead of praying for how\
well I might do my part,\
4:50\
I prayed that the people\
would feel the Lord's love\
4:55\
through my loving service.\
4:58\
I have learned this\
is the key to serving\
5:02\
and blessing others in His name.\
5:06\
I heard a recent experience\
that reminded me of such love.\
5:10\
When all Church meetings were\
suspended due to the COVID-19\
5:14\
pandemic, a ministering\
brother accepted an assignment\
5:19\
from his elders quorum president\
to bless and administer\
5:23\
the sacrament to a\
sister he ministers to.\
5:27\
When he called her to offer\
to bring the sacrament,\
5:30\
she accepted reluctantly,\
hating to take him out\
5:34\
of his own home in\
such a dangerous time\
5:37\
and also believing that things\
would quickly return to normal.\
5:42\
When he arrived at her\
home that Sunday morning,\
5:45\
she had a request: could\
they walk next door\
5:49\
and also have the sacrament\
with her 87-year-old neighbor?\
5:54\
With the bishop's\
authorization, he agreed.\
6:00\
For many, many weeks, and with\
very careful social distancing\
6:04\
and other safety measures,\
that small group of Saints\
6:08\
gathered each Sunday for a\
simple sacrament service.\
6:12\
Just a few pieces of broken\
bread and cups of water--but\
6:17\
many tears shed for the\
goodness of a loving God.\
6:23\
In time, the ministering\
brother, his family,\
6:26\
and the sister he ministers to\
were able to return to church.\
6:31\
But the 87-year-old\
widow, the neighbor,\
6:34\
out of an abundance of\
caution, had to remain home.\
6:38\
The ministering\
brother--remember that his\
6:41\
assignment was to her neighbor\
and not even to this elderly\
6:45\
sister herself--still to this\
day quietly comes to her home\
6:50\
each Sunday, scriptures and a\
tiny piece of bread in hand,\
6:56\
to administer the sacrament\
of the Lord's Supper.\
7:01\
His priesthood service,\
like mine that day\
7:05\
in the care center,\
is given out of love.\
7:08\
In fact, the ministering brother\
recently asked his bishop\
7:12\
if there were others in\
the ward he could care for.\
7:15\
His desire to magnify\
his priesthood service\
7:19\
has grown as he has\
served in the Lord's name\
7:23\
and in a way known almost\
exclusively to Him.\
7:27\
I don't know if the ministering\
brother has prayed, as I did,\
7:31\
for those he serves to\
know of the Lord's love,\
7:34\
but because his service has\
been in the Lord's name,\
7:38\
the result has been the same.\
7:41\
The same wonderful\
result comes when\
7:44\
I pray for it before I\
give a priesthood blessing\
7:47\
to someone who is ill\
or in a time of need.\
7:52\
It happened once in a hospital\
when impatient doctors urged\
7:56\
me--more than urged me, ordered\
me--to hurry and get out\
7:59\
of the way, as they wanted to\
do their work rather than giving\
8:04\
me an opportunity to give\
the priesthood blessing.\
8:09\
I stayed, and I did,\
and that little girl\
8:14\
that I blessed that day, who the\
doctors had thought would die,\
8:19\
lived.\
8:21\
I am grateful at this\
moment that I, that day,\
8:27\
didn't let my own\
feelings get in the way.\
8:31\
But I felt that the Lord\
wanted that little girl\
8:34\
to have a blessing, and I\
knew what the blessing was.\
8:38\
And I blessed her to\
be healed, and she was.\
8:40\
It has happened\
many times as I have\
8:44\
given a blessing to\
someone apparently\
8:46\
near death, with family\
members surrounding the bed,\
8:50\
hoping for a\
blessing of healing.\
8:54\
Even if I've only\
a moment, I always\
8:57\
pray to know what blessing\
the Lord has in store\
9:01\
that I can give in His name.\
9:04\
And I ask to know how He\
wants to bless that person\
9:08\
and not what I or the\
people standing nearby want.\
9:12\
My experience is that even\
when the blessing is not\
9:16\
what others desire for\
themselves or their loved ones,\
9:20\
the Spirit touches\
hearts to experience\
9:23\
acceptance and comfort\
rather than disappointment.\
9:29\
The same inspiration comes\
when patriarchs fast and pray\
9:32\
for guidance to give\
the blessing the Lord\
9:35\
wants for a person.\
9:36\
Again, I have heard\
blessings given\
9:39\
that surprised me and also\
surprised the person receiving\
9:43\
the blessing.\
9:44\
Clearly, the blessing was from\
the Lord--both the warnings it\
9:49\
contains as well as the\
promises shared in His name.\
9:53\
The patriarch's\
prayer and fasting\
9:57\
were rewarded by the Lord.\
10:00\
As a bishop, I learned\
while conducting worthiness\
10:03\
interviews to pray\
for the Lord to let me\
10:07\
sense what He wanted\
for the person,\
10:10\
keeping any inspiration\
He would provide\
10:14\
unclouded by my own judgment.\
10:17\
That is hard if\
the Lord, in love,\
10:20\
may want to bless\
someone with correction.\
10:23\
It takes effort to\
distinguish what\
10:26\
the Lord wants from what you\
and the other person may want.\
10:31\
I believe that we can magnify\
our priesthood service\
10:34\
over our lifetime\
and perhaps beyond.\
10:38\
It will depend on our\
diligence in trying\
10:42\
to know the Lord's\
will and our efforts\
10:45\
to hear His voice\
so that we can know\
10:48\
better what He wants for the\
person we are serving for Him.\
10:55\
That magnification will\
come in small steps.\
10:58\
It may come slowly,\
but it will come.\
11:01\
The Lord promises this to us:\
11:06\
"For whoso is faithful\
unto the obtaining\
11:09\
these two priesthoods\
of which I have spoken,\
11:12\
and the magnifying\
their calling,\
11:15\
are sanctified by\
the Spirit unto\
11:18\
the renewing of their bodies.\
11:21\
"They become the sons of Moses\
and of Aaron and the seed\
11:25\
of Abraham, and the church and\
kingdom, and the elect of God.\
11:32\
"And also all they who\
receive this priesthood\
11:36\
receive me, saith the Lord."\
11:40\
It is my witness that the\
keys of the priesthood\
11:43\
were restored to the\
Prophet Joseph Smith.\
11:46\
Servants of the Lord\
appeared from heaven\
11:50\
to restore the priesthood\
for the great events\
11:53\
that have unfolded and\
that lie before us.\
11:57\
Israel will be gathered.\
12:00\
The Lord's people\
will be prepared\
12:03\
for His glorious Second Coming.\
12:05\
The Restoration will continue.\
12:08\
The Lord will reveal more\
of His will to His prophets\
12:12\
and to His servants.\
12:14\
You may feel small\
compared to the great sweep\
12:18\
of what the Lord will do.\
12:20\
If you do, I invite\
you to ask prayerfully\
12:24\
how the Lord sees you.\
12:26\
He knows you personally,\
He conferred the priesthood\
12:31\
upon you, and your\
rising up and magnifying\
12:35\
the priesthood matter to\
Him because He loves you\
12:39\
and He trusts you to bless\
people He loves in His name.\
12:44\
I bless you now to be able to\
feel His love and His trust.\
12:50\
In the name of the Lord\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
