Almost three years ago,\
President Russell M. Nelson\
0:04\
invited all youth of The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
0:07\
Saints to enlist in "the\
Lord's youth battalion\
0:11\
to gather Israel" on\
both sides of the veil.\
0:14\
He said, "That gathering\
is the most important thing\
0:18\
taking place on earth today."\
0:22\
I am absolutely sure you youth\
can do this--and do it very\
0:26\
well--because of (1) something\
about your identity and (2)\
0:31\
an enormous power within you.\
0:35\
Forty-one years ago, two\
missionaries from our Church\
0:38\
felt led to a house in New\
Jersey in the United States.\
0:42\
In time, miraculously, both\
parents and all 10 children\
0:47\
were baptized.\
0:48\
In the prophet's words,\
they "let God prevail"\
0:51\
in their lives.\
0:53\
I should say "our lives."\
0:55\
I was the third child.\
0:57\
I was seventeen years\
old when I decided\
1:00\
to make a permanent covenant\
to follow Jesus Christ.\
1:04\
But guess what else I decided?\
1:06\
I would not serve a\
full-time mission.\
1:09\
That was too much.\
1:11\
And this could not be\
expected of me, right?\
1:14\
I was a brand-new Church member.\
1:16\
I had no money.\
1:18\
Besides, although I had just\
graduated from the toughest\
1:22\
high school in nearby\
West Philadelphia\
1:24\
and faced down some\
dangerous challenges,\
1:28\
I was secretly terrified\
of leaving home\
1:31\
for two whole years.\
1:34\
But I had just learned\
that I and all of humanity\
1:38\
had lived with our\
Heavenly Father\
1:40\
as His spirit sons and\
daughters before our birth.\
1:43\
Others needed to\
know, as I knew,\
1:46\
that He longed for\
all His children\
1:48\
to enjoy eternal life with Him.\
1:51\
So before anyone\
was on earth, He\
1:53\
presented all with\
His perfect plan\
1:56\
of salvation and happiness,\
with Jesus Christ as our Savior.\
2:00\
Tragically, Satan\
opposed God's plan.\
2:04\
According to the\
Book of Revelation,\
2:06\
"there was war in heaven"!\
2:08\
Satan cunningly\
deceived a third part\
2:11\
of Heavenly Father's\
spirit children\
2:13\
into letting him\
prevail instead of God.\
2:17\
But not you!\
2:18\
The Apostle John saw\
that you overcame Satan\
2:22\
"by the word of\
[your] testimony."\
2:28\
Knowing my true identity--helped\
by my patriarchal\
2:31\
blessing--gave me the courage\
and faith to accept President\
2:35\
Spencer W. Kimball's\
invitation to gather Israel.\
2:39\
It will be the same\
for you, dear friends.\
2:42\
Knowing you overcame Satan\
by the word of your testimony\
2:46\
before will help you\
"love, share, and invite"\
2:50\
now and always--to invite others\
to come and see, come and help,\
2:56\
and come and belong--as\
that same war for the souls\
3:00\
of God's children rages on.\
3:04\
What about the enormous\
power within you?\
3:06\
Think of this: you\
shouted for joy\
3:10\
to come to a fallen world,\
where all would face\
3:13\
physical and spiritual death.\
3:15\
We would never be able to\
overcome either on our own.\
3:19\
We would not only suffer from\
our own sins but others' sins\
3:22\
too.\
3:23\
Humanity would experience\
virtually every imaginable type\
3:27\
of brokenness and\
disappointment--all with a veil\
3:31\
of forgetfulness over our minds\
and the world's worst enemy\
3:34\
continuing to\
target and tempt us.\
3:37\
All hope for returning\
resurrected and clean\
3:41\
to God's holy presence\
rested entirely\
3:44\
upon one Being\
keeping His promise.\
3:47\
What empowered\
you to go forward?\
3:51\
President Henry B. Eyring\
taught, "It took faith\
3:55\
in Jesus Christ to sustain\
the plan of happiness\
3:59\
and Jesus Christ's\
place in it when\
4:01\
you knew so little\
of the challenges\
4:03\
that you would\
face in mortality."\
4:07\
When Jesus Christ promised\
He would come into mortality\
4:11\
and give His life to\
gather and save us,\
4:13\
you did not simply believe Him.\
4:15\
You "noble spirits" had\
such "exceedingly great\
4:19\
faith" that you saw\
His promise as sure.\
4:23\
He could not lie,\
so you saw Him as\
4:26\
if He had already shed\
His blood for you, long\
4:29\
before He was born.\
4:31\
In John's symbolic words,\
you "overcame [Satan]\
4:36\
by the blood of the Lamb."\
4:40\
President Dallin H. Oaks\
taught that in that world,\
4:43\
"[you] saw the end\
from the beginning."\
4:49\
Suppose one day, before\
you leave for school,\
4:52\
one of your parents\
makes a true promise\
4:54\
that you can have your favorite\
food when you return home!\
4:58\
You are excited!\
5:00\
While in school, you\
imagine eating that food,\
5:03\
and you can already taste it.\
5:05\
Naturally, you share your\
good news with others.\
5:08\
Looking forward to going\
home makes you so happy\
5:11\
that the tests and challenges\
of school seem light.\
5:15\
Nothing can take away\
your joy or make you\
5:18\
doubt because of how\
sure the promise is!\
5:22\
Similarly, before you\
"noble spirits" were born,\
5:25\
you learned to see Christ's\
promises in this sure way,\
5:29\
and you tasted of His salvation.\
5:32\
Your great faith is\
like muscles that\
5:35\
get stronger and bigger\
the more you exercise them,\
5:39\
but they are already inside you.\
5:42\
How can you awaken your\
giant faith in Christ\
5:45\
and use it to gather Israel now\
and triumph over Satan again?\
5:49\
By relearning to\
look forward and see\
5:53\
with that same certainty\
the Lord's promise\
5:56\
to gather and save today.\
5:58\
He mainly uses the Book\
of Mormon and His prophets\
6:01\
to teach us how.\
6:03\
Long before Christ, "the\
[Nephite] prophets, and ...\
6:07\
priests, and ... teachers\
... persuad[ed] [the people]\
6:10\
to look forward\
unto the Messiah,\
6:12\
and believe in him to come\
as though he already was."\
6:17\
The prophet Abinadi taught,\
"And now if Christ had not\
6:22\
come into the world,\
speaking of things\
6:24\
to come as though\
they had already come,\
6:27\
there could have\
been no redemption."\
6:30\
Like Alma, Abinadi "look[ed]\
forward with an eye of faith,\
6:34\
and [saw]" God's sure promise of\
salvation as already fulfilled.\
6:39\
They "overcame [Satan] by the\
blood of the Lamb, and ...\
6:44\
the word of their testimony"\
long before Christ was born,\
6:49\
just as you did.\
6:51\
And the Lord gave them power\
to invite and gather Israel.\
6:55\
He will do the same for you\
as you look forward in faith,\
6:59\
see Israel gathered--globally\
and in your own circles--and\
7:03\
invite all!\
7:06\
Hundreds of missionaries built\
upon their powerful premortal\
7:10\
faith in Christ by envisioning\
those they contacted or taught\
7:15\
dressed in baptismal\
and temple clothing.\
7:18\
In a talk titled "Begin\
with the End in Mind,"\
7:22\
President Nelson shared a\
personal example of doing this\
7:26\
and instructed mission leaders\
to teach our missionaries\
7:29\
to do the same.\
7:32\
Knowing they exercised this\
great faith in Jesus Christ\
7:36\
in the premortal world immensely\
helped our dear missionaries\
7:40\
"hear Him" and activate their\
enormous faith to gather Israel\
7:45\
as the Lord promised.\
7:48\
Of course, imagining\
lies harms faith.\
7:52\
My friends, intentionally\
envisioning or viewing things\
7:57\
that conflict with\
who you really are,\
7:59\
especially pornography,\
will weaken your faith\
8:03\
in Christ and without\
repentance could destroy it.\
8:08\
Please use your imaginations\
to increase faith in Christ,\
8:12\
not ruin it.\
8:15\
The Children and Youth\
program is a prophetic tool\
8:18\
to help you youth power\
up your great faith.\
8:21\
President Oaks\
taught, "That program\
8:25\
is designed to help you become\
more like our Savior in four\
8:28\
areas: spiritual, social,\
physical, and intellectual."\
8:34\
As you youth lead--lead\
in living the gospel,\
8:38\
caring for others, inviting\
all to receive the gospel,\
8:42\
uniting families for eternity,\
and organizing fun activities,\
8:48\
the great faith in Christ you\
had in the premortal life will\
8:52\
resurface and empower you\
to do His work in this life!\
8:58\
Also, personal goals,\
"especially short-term goals,"\
9:02\
help you reignite\
your powerful faith.\
9:05\
When you set a good goal, you\
are looking forward--as you did\
9:10\
before--and seeing what your\
Heavenly Father wants you\
9:14\
or another to become.\
9:17\
Elder Quentin L. Cook\
taught, "Never underestimate\
9:21\
the importance of\
planning, setting goals ...\
9:24\
and [inviting others]--all\
with an eye of faith."\
9:29\
The choice is yours!\
9:31\
The Lord said of you, "The\
power [to choose] is in them."\
9:36\
Elder Neil L. Andersen\
explained, "Your faith\
9:40\
will grow not by\
chance but by choice."\
9:44\
He added, "[any] honest\
questions [you may have] ...\
9:47\
will be settled with patience\
and an eye of faith."\
9:55\
I testify that (1)\
your true identity\
9:59\
and (2) the enormous power\
of faith in Christ within you\
10:03\
will enable you to "help prepare\
the world for the Savior's\
10:07\
return by inviting all\
to come unto Christ\
10:12\
and receive the blessings\
of His Atonement."\
10:15\
May we all share the joy of the\
Book of Mormon's sure promise\
10:20\
"The righteous that hearken\
unto the ... prophets ...\
10:24\
[and] look forward unto\
Christ with steadfastness ...\
10:28\
notwithstanding all\
persecution with him."\
10:38\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
