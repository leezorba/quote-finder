throughout the ages god has spoken\
0:03\
through his servants the prophets\
0:06\
this morning we have had the privilege\
0:11\
to hear the prophet of god\
0:14\
speak to all the world we love you\
0:17\
president nelson\
0:18\
and i encourage everyone everywhere to\
0:21\
study\
0:22\
and heed your words my dear brothers and\
0:25\
sisters\
0:26\
before i reach my 12th birthday our\
0:30\
family had been forced twice to flee our\
0:32\
home and start amid\
0:34\
the chaos fear and uncertainties caused\
0:37\
by war and political division it was an\
0:41\
anxious time for me but it must have\
0:43\
been terrifying\
0:45\
for my beloved parents my mother and\
0:47\
father shared little about this\
0:49\
burden with us four children they bore\
0:52\
the strain\
0:53\
and suffering as best as they could the\
0:56\
fear must have been oppressive\
0:59\
and consuming their hours and dampening\
1:01\
their hope\
1:02\
this time of bleakness after world war\
1:04\
ii left its mark\
1:06\
upon the world it left its mark\
1:09\
upon me back then in the\
1:13\
solitude of my loneliest hours i often\
1:16\
wondered\
1:17\
is there any hope left in the world\
1:20\
as i pondered these questions i thought\
1:22\
about our young\
1:24\
american missionaries who served among\
1:27\
us\
1:27\
during those years they had left the\
1:30\
safety\
1:31\
of their homes have rolled away and\
1:34\
traveled to germany\
1:35\
land of their reasoned enemies\
1:38\
to offer divine hope to our people\
1:42\
they came not to blame lecture or shame\
1:46\
they willingly gave off their young\
1:49\
lives without thought of earthly gain\
1:52\
wanting only to help others find the joy\
1:55\
and peace they had experienced\
1:59\
to me these young men and women were\
2:01\
perfect\
2:02\
i'm sure they had flaws but not to me\
2:06\
i will always think of them as being\
2:08\
bigger than life\
2:10\
angels of light and glory ministers of\
2:13\
compassion goodness and truth\
2:16\
while the world was drowning in cynicism\
2:20\
bitterness hatred and fear\
2:23\
the example and teachings of these\
2:26\
young people filled me with hope\
2:31\
the gospel message they offered\
2:34\
transcended\
2:35\
politics history grudges grievances\
2:39\
and personal agendas it gave divine\
2:43\
answers to important questions we had\
2:46\
during these difficult times the message\
2:49\
was that\
2:50\
god lived and cared about us even in\
2:53\
these\
2:53\
hours of turmoil confusion\
2:56\
and chaos that he actually appeared in\
3:00\
our time to restore\
3:01\
truth and light his gospel\
3:04\
and his church that he speaks to\
3:07\
prophets again\
3:09\
that god is among us and is personally\
3:12\
involved in our lives\
3:14\
and actively guiding his children\
3:18\
it is astonishing what we can learn when\
3:20\
we look a little closer to our heavenly\
3:22\
father's plan of salvation\
3:25\
and exaltation the plan of happiness\
3:29\
for his children when we feel\
3:32\
insignificant cast off and forgotten\
3:36\
we learn that we may be assured that god\
3:39\
has\
3:39\
not forgotten us in fact that he\
3:43\
offers to all his children something\
3:47\
unimaginable to become heirs\
3:50\
of god and joint heirs with christ\
3:54\
what does this mean that we will live\
3:58\
forever receive a fullness of joy and\
4:00\
have\
4:01\
the potential to inherit thrones\
4:03\
kingdoms principalities\
4:04\
and powers it is so humbling to know\
4:08\
that this magnificent and supernal\
4:11\
future is possible not because\
4:15\
of who we are but because\
4:18\
of who god is\
4:21\
knowing this how could we ever murmur\
4:25\
or remain embittered how could we ever\
4:27\
keep our eyes\
4:29\
on the ground when the king of kings\
4:33\
invites us to take flight into an\
4:35\
unimaginable future\
4:37\
of divine happiness because of god's\
4:40\
perfect love for us\
4:42\
and the eternal sacrifice of jesus\
4:45\
christ\
4:46\
our sins both great and small\
4:50\
can be blotted out and remembered\
4:53\
no more we can stand before him\
4:57\
pure worthy and sanctified\
5:01\
my heart overflows with gratitude for my\
5:05\
heavenly father i realize that he has\
5:07\
not\
5:07\
doomed his children to stumble through\
5:09\
mortality without hope for a bright\
5:12\
and eternal future he has provided\
5:14\
instructions\
5:16\
that reveal the way back to him\
5:20\
and at the center of it all is\
5:24\
his beloved son jesus christ\
5:29\
and his sacrifice for us\
5:33\
the savior's infinite atonement\
5:35\
completely changes the way\
5:37\
we may view our transgressions and\
5:39\
imperfections\
5:41\
instead of dwelling on them and feeling\
5:43\
irredeemable\
5:45\
or hopeless we can learn from them and\
5:48\
feel\
5:49\
hopeful the cleansing gift of repentance\
5:54\
allows us to leave our sins behind\
5:58\
and emerge a new creature\
6:02\
because of jesus christ\
6:05\
our failures do not have to define us\
6:10\
they can refine us\
6:13\
like in musician rehearsing scales\
6:17\
we can see our missteps flaws and sins\
6:20\
as\
6:20\
opportunities for greater self-awareness\
6:24\
deeper and more honest love for others\
6:28\
and refinement through repentance\
6:33\
if we repent mistakes do not disqualify\
6:36\
us\
6:38\
they are part of our progress\
6:42\
we are all infants compared to the\
6:44\
beings of glory and grandeur\
6:46\
we are designed to become no mortal\
6:49\
being advances from crawling to walking\
6:51\
to running\
6:52\
without frequent stumbles bumps and\
6:55\
bruises\
6:56\
that is how we learn if we\
6:59\
earnestly keep practicing always\
7:02\
striving to keep\
7:04\
god's commandments and committing our\
7:06\
efforts\
7:07\
to repenting enduring and applying\
7:10\
what we learn line upon line we will\
7:13\
gather\
7:14\
light into our souls\
7:18\
and through and though we may not\
7:21\
fully comprehend our full potential\
7:24\
now we know that\
7:28\
when the savior shall appear we will see\
7:31\
his countenance in us\
7:33\
and shall see him as he is what a\
7:36\
glorious promise\
7:37\
yes the world is in turmoil and yes\
7:41\
we have weaknesses but we do not need\
7:44\
to hang our head in despair because we\
7:46\
can trust\
7:47\
god we can trust his son jesus christ\
7:50\
and we can accept the gift of the spirit\
7:53\
to guide us\
7:54\
on this path toward a life filled with\
7:56\
joy and divine\
7:58\
happiness i often wondered\
8:02\
what would jesus teach and do\
8:06\
if he were among us today\
8:10\
after the resurrection jesus christ\
8:11\
fulfilled his promise to visit\
8:13\
his other sheep the book of mormon\
8:17\
another testament of jesus christ speaks\
8:19\
of such an\
8:20\
appearance to the people on the american\
8:24\
continent we have this precious record\
8:28\
as a tangible witness of the savior's\
8:31\
work\
8:32\
the people of the book of mormon lived\
8:34\
on the other side of the globe\
8:35\
their histories cultures and political\
8:38\
climates were vastly different\
8:41\
from the people jesus taught during his\
8:44\
mortal ministry\
8:45\
and yet he taught them many of the same\
8:49\
things he taught in the holy land\
8:51\
why would he do that the savior\
8:54\
always teaches timeless truth\
8:58\
they apply to people of every age\
9:01\
and in any circumstance his message was\
9:05\
and is\
9:06\
a message of hope and belonging\
9:10\
a testimony that god our heavenly father\
9:12\
has not\
9:13\
abandoned his children that god is\
9:16\
among us 200 years ago the savior again\
9:20\
returned to earth\
9:21\
together with god the father he appeared\
9:24\
to\
9:24\
14 year old joseph smith and ushered in\
9:28\
the restoration of the gospel and the\
9:30\
church of jesus christ\
9:32\
from that day forward the heavens opened\
9:35\
and heavenly messages descended from\
9:37\
halls of immortal glory light and\
9:40\
knowledge\
9:41\
poured from forth from the celestial\
9:44\
throne\
9:46\
the lord jesus christ spoke once again\
9:49\
to the world\
9:50\
what did he say to our blessing\
9:54\
many of his words are recorded in the\
9:57\
doctrine\
9:57\
and covenants available to anyone in the\
10:00\
world\
10:01\
who wishes to read and study them\
10:04\
how priceless are these words to us\
10:07\
today and we should not be surprised\
10:11\
to find that the savior again teaches\
10:14\
the core message of his gospel\
10:17\
thou shalt love the lord thy god with\
10:19\
all thy heart\
10:21\
with all thy might mind and strength and\
10:23\
in the name of jesus christ thou\
10:25\
shalt serve him he inspires us\
10:29\
to seek god and live by the teachings\
10:33\
he has revealed to his servants the\
10:35\
prophets\
10:36\
he teaches us to love one another\
10:40\
and to be full of charity towards all\
10:43\
men\
10:45\
he invites us to be his hands to go\
10:48\
about\
10:48\
doing good let us not love in word\
10:52\
but indeed and in truth he challenges\
10:56\
us to heed his great commission to love\
11:00\
to share to invite all to his gospel\
11:04\
and his church he commands us to build\
11:07\
holy temples and to enter and serve\
11:09\
there he teaches us to become his\
11:11\
disciples\
11:12\
that our hearts should not strive for\
11:16\
personal power\
11:17\
wealth approval or position\
11:21\
he teaches us to lay aside the things of\
11:23\
this world\
11:24\
and seek for the things of a better\
11:29\
he urges us to seek joy enlightenment\
11:33\
peace truth happiness\
11:36\
and the promise of immortality and\
11:38\
eternal life\
11:40\
let us take this a step further suppose\
11:44\
jesus came to your ward to your branch\
11:47\
or to your home today what would that be\
11:51\
like\
11:53\
he would see right into your heart\
11:57\
outward appearances would lose\
12:00\
their importance he would know\
12:04\
you as you are he would\
12:07\
know your heart's desires\
12:11\
the meek and the humble he would lift\
12:14\
the sick he would heal the doubting\
12:18\
he would infuse with faith and courage\
12:20\
to believe he would teach\
12:21\
us to open our hearts to god and reach\
12:25\
out to others he would recognize\
12:29\
and honor honesty\
12:32\
humility integrity faithfulness\
12:36\
compassion and charity\
12:39\
