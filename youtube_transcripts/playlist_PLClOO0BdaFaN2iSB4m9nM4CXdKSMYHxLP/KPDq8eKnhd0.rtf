Throughout his ministry,\
President Russell M. Nelson\
0:04\
has studied and taught of God's\
covenants with His children.\
0:07\
He himself is a\
shining example of one\
0:11\
who walks the covenant path.\
0:13\
In his first message as\
President of the Church,\
0:16\
President Nelson stated:\
0:19\
"Your commitment to follow the\
Savior by making covenants with\
0:23\
Him and then keeping these\
covenants will open the door\
0:26\
to every spiritual [privilege\
and blessing] available\
0:29\
to [women, men,] and\
children everywhere. ...\
0:32\
"...\
0:32\
The ordinances of the\
temple and the covenants\
0:35\
you make there are\
key to strengthening\
0:37\
your life, your marriage\
and family, and your ability\
0:41\
to resist the attacks\
of the adversary.\
0:43\
Your worship in the\
temple and your service\
0:46\
there for your\
ancestors will bless you\
0:49\
with increased personal\
revelation and peace\
0:52\
and will fortify your\
commitment to [keep]\
0:55\
on the covenant path."\
0:59\
What is the covenant path?\
1:01\
It is the one path that leads\
to the celestial kingdom of God.\
1:07\
We embark upon the path at the\
gate of baptism and then "press\
1:13\
forward with a\
steadfastness in Christ,\
1:15\
having a perfect\
brightness of hope,\
1:18\
and a love of God and of\
all men"--the two great\
1:21\
commandments--"to the end."\
1:24\
In the course of the covenant\
path (which, by the way,\
1:27\
extends beyond mortality),\
we receive all the ordinances\
1:32\
and covenants pertaining to\
salvation and exaltation.\
1:37\
Our overarching\
covenant commitment\
1:40\
is to do God's will "and to be\
obedient to His commandments\
1:44\
in all things that\
He shall command us."\
1:46\
Following the principles\
and commandments\
1:49\
of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ day by day\
1:52\
is the happiest and most\
satisfying course in life.\
1:56\
For one thing, a person\
avoids a great many problems\
2:00\
and regrets.\
2:01\
Let me use a sports analogy.\
2:04\
In tennis, there is something\
called unforced errors.\
2:08\
These are things such as hitting\
a playable ball into the net\
2:11\
or double-faulting when serving.\
2:14\
Unforced errors are\
considered the result\
2:17\
of a player's\
blunder rather than\
2:20\
being caused by the\
opponent's skill.\
2:23\
Too often our\
problems or challenges\
2:25\
are self-inflicted, the\
result of poor choices,\
2:29\
or, we could say, the\
result of "unforced errors."\
2:32\
When we are diligently\
pursuing the covenant path,\
2:36\
we quite naturally avoid\
many "unforced errors."\
2:40\
We sidestep the various\
forms of addiction.\
2:43\
We do not fall into the\
ditch of dishonest conduct.\
2:46\
We cross over the abyss of\
immorality and infidelity.\
2:51\
We bypass the people and\
things that, even if popular,\
2:55\
would jeopardize our physical\
and spiritual well-being.\
2:59\
We avoid the choices that\
harm or disadvantage others\
3:03\
and instead acquire the habits\
of self-discipline and service.\
3:09\
Elder J. Golden Kimball\
is purported to have said,\
3:12\
"I may not [have always walked]\
the straight and narrow,\
3:15\
but I ... try to cross\
it as often as I can."\
3:19\
In a more serious moment, I\
am sure Brother Kimball would\
3:22\
agree that staying\
on, not just crossing,\
3:26\
the covenant path is our\
greatest hope for avoiding\
3:29\
avoidable misery on one\
hand and successfully\
3:33\
dealing with the unavoidable\
woes of life on the other.\
3:38\
Some might say, "I\
can make good choices\
3:40\
with or without\
baptism; I don't need\
3:43\
covenants to be an honorable\
and successful person."\
3:47\
Indeed, there are many who,\
while not on the covenant\
3:50\
path themselves,\
act in a way that\
3:53\
mirrors the choices and\
contributions of those\
3:56\
who are on the path.\
3:58\
You might say they reap\
the blessings of walking\
4:00\
a "covenant-consistent" path.\
4:03\
What, then, is the difference\
of the covenant path?\
4:08\
Actually, the\
difference is uniquely\
4:10\
and eternally significant.\
4:12\
It includes the nature of\
our obedience, the character\
4:16\
of God's commitment\
to us, the divine\
4:19\
help we receive, the blessings\
tied to gathering as a covenant\
4:24\
people, and, most importantly,\
our eternal inheritance.\
4:30\
First is the nature of\
our obedience to God.\
4:33\
More than simply\
having good intentions,\
4:36\
we solemnly commit to live by\
every word that proceeds forth\
4:40\
from the mouth of God.\
4:41\
In this, we follow the\
example of Jesus Christ, who,\
4:45\
by being baptized, "showeth\
unto the children of men\
4:49\
that, according to the\
flesh he humbleth himself\
4:51\
before the Father, and\
witnesseth unto the Father\
4:54\
that he would be\
obedient unto him\
4:57\
in keeping his commandments."\
5:00\
With covenants, we're intent\
on more than just avoiding\
5:02\
mistakes or being\
prudent in our decisions.\
5:06\
We feel accountable to God\
for our choices and our lives.\
5:10\
We take upon us\
the name of Christ.\
5:13\
We're focused on Christ--on\
being valiant in the testimony\
5:16\
of Jesus and on developing\
the character of Christ.\
5:21\
With covenants, obedience\
to gospel principles\
5:24\
becomes rooted in our very soul.\
5:26\
I am familiar with\
a couple where,\
5:29\
at the time of their\
marriage, the wife was not\
5:32\
active in the Church and\
the husband had never\
5:34\
been a member of the Church.\
5:36\
I will refer to them as Mary\
and John--not their real names.\
5:40\
As children began to\
enter the picture,\
5:43\
Mary felt keenly the\
need to raise them,\
5:46\
as the scripture says, in\
"the nurture and admonition\
5:49\
of the Lord."\
5:50\
John was supportive.\
5:52\
Mary made some\
important sacrifices\
5:55\
to be home to teach the\
gospel on a consistent basis.\
5:59\
She ensured that the\
family took full advantage\
6:02\
of Church worship and activity.\
6:04\
Mary and John became\
exemplary parents,\
6:07\
and their children\
(all energetic boys)\
6:10\
grew in faith and devotion\
to gospel principles\
6:14\
and standards.\
6:16\
John's parents, the\
boys' grandparents,\
6:18\
were pleased with the wholesome\
lives and achievements\
6:21\
of their grandsons, but\
because of some antagonism\
6:24\
toward the Church, they wanted\
to attribute this success\
6:28\
exclusively to the parenting\
skills of John and Mary.\
6:32\
John, although not a\
member of the Church,\
6:35\
did not let that\
assessment go unchallenged.\
6:38\
He insisted that they were\
witnessing the fruits of gospel\
6:41\
teachings--what his sons were\
experiencing in Church as well\
6:45\
as what was happening at home.\
6:48\
John himself was being\
influenced by the Spirit,\
6:51\
by the love and\
example of his wife,\
6:53\
and by the urgings of his sons.\
6:55\
In due course, he was baptized,\
much to the joy of ward members\
6:59\
and friends.\
7:02\
While life has not\
been without challenges\
7:04\
for them and their sons,\
Mary and John wholeheartedly\
7:07\
affirm that it is in fact\
the gospel covenant that is\
7:12\
at the root of their blessings.\
7:13\
They've seen the Lord's\
words to Jeremiah fulfilled\
7:18\
in the lives of their\
children as well as their own:\
7:20\
"I will put my law in their\
inward parts, and write it [on]\
7:24\
their hearts; and\
will be their God,\
7:27\
and they shall be my people."\
7:30\
A second unique aspect\
of the covenant path\
7:32\
is our relationship with Deity.\
7:34\
The covenants God offers to His\
children do more than guide us.\
7:38\
They bind us to Him.\
7:40\
And bound to Him we can\
overcome all things.\
7:44\
I once read an article by\
a poorly informed newspaper\
7:48\
reporter who explained\
that the way we perform\
7:51\
baptisms for the dead is to\
immerse rolls of microfilm\
7:55\
in water.\
7:56\
Then all those whose names\
appear on the microfilm\
7:59\
are considered baptized.\
8:02\
That approach\
would be efficient,\
8:05\
but it ignores the\
infinite worth of each soul\
8:09\
and the critical importance of\
a personal covenant with God.\
8:14\
JESUS SAID: "Enter ye in at\
the strait gate; for strait\
8:18\
is the gate, and narrow is\
the way that leads to life,\
8:21\
and few there be that find it."\
8:23\
Figuratively speaking,\
this gate is so narrow\
8:27\
that it allows only one\
person to enter at a time.\
8:30\
Each one makes an individual\
commitment to God and in return\
8:36\
receives from Him a\
personal covenant,\
8:39\
by name, that he or she\
can rely on implicitly\
8:43\
in time and eternity.\
8:46\
With the ordinances\
and covenants,\
8:48\
the power of godliness\
is manifest in our lives.\
8:53\
This leads us to consideration\
of a third special blessing\
8:56\
of the covenant path.\
8:58\
God provides an almost\
incomprehensible gift\
9:02\
to help covenant-makers\
be covenant-keepers:\
9:06\
the gift of the Holy Ghost.\
9:08\
This gift is the right to\
the constant companionship,\
9:12\
protection, and guidance\
of the Holy Spirit.\
9:14\
Also known as the\
Comforter, the Holy Spirit\
9:18\
"filleth with hope\
and perfect love."\
9:20\
He "knoweth all things, and\
beareth record of the Father\
9:24\
and ... the Son," whose\
witnesses we commit to be.\
9:29\
On the covenant path we also\
find the essential blessings\
9:33\
of forgiveness and\
cleansing from sin.\
9:37\
This is help that can come\
only through divine grace,\
9:41\
administered by the Holy Ghost.\
9:43\
"Now this is the\
commandment," says the Lord.\
9:47\
"Repent, all ye ends of\
the earth, and come unto me\
9:51\
and be baptized in\
my name, that ye\
9:54\
may be sanctified by the\
reception of the Holy Ghost,\
9:58\
that ye may stand spotless\
before me at the last day."\
10:04\
Fourth, those pursuing\
the covenant path also\
10:07\
find singular blessings in\
various divinely appointed\
10:11\
gatherings.\
10:13\
Prophecies of a\
literal gathering\
10:16\
of the long-dispersed\
tribes of Israel\
10:18\
to the lands of\
their inheritance\
10:20\
are found throughout\
the scriptures.\
10:22\
The fulfillment of those\
prophecies and promises\
10:25\
is now underway with the\
gathering of the covenant\
10:29\
people into the Church, the\
kingdom of God on the earth.\
10:33\
President Nelson explains,\
"When we speak of the gathering,\
10:37\
we are simply saying\
this fundamental truth:\
10:41\
every one of our Heavenly\
Father's children ...\
10:44\
deserves to hear the message\
of the restored gospel of Jesus\
10:47\
Christ."\
10:50\
The Lord commands members of\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
10:53\
of Latter-day Saints to\
"arise and shine forth,\
10:57\
that thy light may be a\
standard for the nations; ...\
11:01\
that the gathering together\
upon the land of Zion,\
11:04\
and upon her stakes,\
may be for a defense,\
11:08\
and for a refuge from the storm,\
and from wrath when it shall be\
11:12\
poured out without mixture\
upon the whole earth."\
11:16\
There is also a weekly\
gathering of the covenant people\
11:19\
to the house of prayer\
on the Lord's day,\
11:22\
that we may "more\
fully keep [ourselves]\
11:24\
unspotted from the world."\
11:26\
It is a gathering to partake\
of sacramental bread and water\
11:30\
in remembrance of the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ and a time\
11:34\
"to fast and to pray,\
and to speak [with one]\
11:36\
another concerning the\
welfare of [our] souls."\
11:40\
As a teenager, I\
was the only member\
11:43\
of the Church in my\
high school class.\
11:46\
I enjoyed the association of\
many good friends in school,\
11:50\
yet I found that I relied\
heavily on this Sabbath\
11:54\
gathering each week to refresh\
and renew me spiritually\
11:58\
and even physically.\
11:59\
How keenly we have felt the\
loss of this regular covenant\
12:04\
gathering during the\
current pandemic,\
12:07\
and how eagerly we anticipate\
the time when we can\
12:11\
come together again as before.\
12:14\
The covenant people\
gather also to the temple,\
12:17\
the house of the Lord, to obtain\
the ordinances, blessings,\
12:21\
and revelation uniquely\
available there.\
12:24\
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught:\
12:28\
"What was the object\
of gathering ...\
12:30\
the people of God in any\
age of the world? ...\
12:32\
The main object was to build\
unto the Lord a house whereby\
12:36\
He could reveal unto His people\
the ordinances of His house\
12:41\
and the glories of\
His kingdom, and teach\
12:44\
the people the way of\
salvation; for there\
12:47\
are certain ordinances and\
principles that, when they are\
12:50\
taught and practiced,\
must be done in a place\
12:54\
or [a] house built\
for that purpose."\
12:58\
Finally, it is only in pursuing\
the covenant path that we\
13:03\
inherit the blessings\
of Abraham, Isaac,\
13:05\
and Jacob--the ultimate\
blessings of salvation\
13:08\
and exaltation that\
only God can give.\
13:12\
Scriptural references\
to the covenant people\
13:15\
often mean literal\
descendants of Abraham,\
13:17\
or the "house of Israel."\
13:18\
But the covenant\
people also include\
13:21\
all who receive the\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
13:24\
Paul explained:\
"For as many of you\
13:27\
as have been baptized into\
Christ have put on Christ.\
13:30\
...\
13:31\
And if ye be Christ's, then\
[ye are] Abraham's seed,\
13:34\
and heirs according\
to the promise."\
13:38\
Those who are loyal\
to their covenants\
13:40\
"shall come forth in the\
resurrection of the just."\
13:44\
They are "made\
perfect through Jesus\
13:46\
the mediator of\
the new covenant.\
13:48\
...\
13:48\
These are they whose\
bodies are celestial,\
13:51\
whose glory is that of the\
sun, even the glory of God,\
13:55\
the highest of all."\
13:56\
"Wherefore, all things are\
theirs, whether life or death,\
13:59\
or things present,\
or things to come,\
14:02\
all are theirs and they are\
Christ's, and Christ is God's."\
14:07\
Let us heed the prophet's call\
to stay on the covenant path.\
14:10\
Nephi saw our time and\
recorded, "I, Nephi, beheld\
14:15\
the power of the Lamb of\
God, that it descended\
14:17\
upon the saints of the\
church of the Lamb,\
14:19\
and upon the covenant people\
of the Lord, who were scattered\
14:23\
upon all the face of\
the earth; and they\
14:26\
were armed with righteousness\
and with the power of God\
14:29\
in great glory."\
14:30\
With Nephi, my soul delighteth\
in the covenants of the Lord.\
14:35\
On this Easter Sunday,\
I bear testimony\
14:38\
of Jesus Christ,\
whose Resurrection\
14:41\
is our hope and the\
assurance of all\
14:44\
that is promised on and at\
the end of the covenant path.\
14:49\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
