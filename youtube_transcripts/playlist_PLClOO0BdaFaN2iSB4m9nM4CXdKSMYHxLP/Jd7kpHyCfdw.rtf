My dear brethren, I\
have looked forward\
0:04\
to this virtual\
meeting with you.\
0:07\
The last time we\
held a Priesthood\
0:09\
Session of general\
conference was in April 2019.\
0:13\
Much has happened in\
the past two years!\
0:19\
Some of you have\
lost loved ones.\
0:22\
Others have lost jobs,\
livelihood, or health.\
0:29\
Still others have lost\
a sense of peace or hope\
0:33\
for the future.\
0:34\
My heart goes out\
to each one of you\
0:37\
who has suffered\
these or other losses.\
0:41\
I pray constantly that\
the Lord will comfort you.\
0:46\
As you continue to let\
God prevail in your life,\
0:50\
I know that He is just as\
optimistic about your future\
0:55\
as He has ever been.\
0:59\
Amid the losses we\
have experienced,\
1:02\
there are also some\
things we have found.\
1:06\
Some have found deeper\
faith in our Heavenly Father\
1:10\
and His Son, Jesus Christ.\
1:13\
Many have found a fresh\
perspective on life--even\
1:18\
an eternal perspective.\
1:21\
You may have found stronger\
relationships with your loved\
1:24\
ones and with the Lord.\
1:28\
And I hope you have found\
an increased ability\
1:32\
to hear Him and receive\
personal revelation.\
1:39\
Difficult trials often\
provide opportunities\
1:43\
to grow that would not\
have come in any other way.\
1:49\
Think back on the\
past two years.\
1:53\
How have you grown?\
1:55\
What have you learned?\
1:59\
You might initially wish\
you could go back to 2019\
2:02\
and stay there!\
2:05\
But if you look at\
your life prayerfully,\
2:07\
I believe you will see many\
ways in which the Lord has been\
2:10\
guiding you through\
this time of hardship,\
2:14\
helping you to become a more\
devoted, more converted man--\
2:18\
a true man of God.\
2:23\
I know the Lord has\
great and marvelous plans\
2:26\
for us--individually\
and collectively.\
2:29\
With compassion and patience, He\
says: "Ye are little children,\
2:38\
and ye have not as yet\
understood how great blessings\
2:42\
the Father hath ...\
prepared for you;\
2:44\
"And ye cannot bear all\
things now; nevertheless,\
2:49\
be of good cheer, for\
I will lead you along."\
2:58\
My dear brothers, I testify\
that He has been, and is,\
3:02\
indeed leading us along,\
as we seek to hear Him.\
3:07\
He wants us to grow and to\
learn, even through and perhaps\
3:12\
especially through adversity.\
3:16\
Adversity is a great teacher.\
3:20\
What have you learned\
in the past two years\
3:23\
that you always\
want to remember?\
3:27\
Your answers will be\
unique to you, but may\
3:30\
I suggest four lessons I hope we\
have all learned and will never\
3:35\
forget.\
3:38\
LESSON 1: The home is the\
center of faith and worship.\
3:45\
Often when the Lord\
warns us about the perils\
3:47\
of the last days, He counsels\
thus: "Stand ye in holy places,\
3:54\
and be not moved."\
3:57\
These "holy places" certainly\
include the Lord's temples\
4:01\
and meetinghouses.\
4:02\
But as our ability to gather\
in these places has been\
4:05\
restricted in varying degrees,\
we have learned that one\
4:09\
of the holiest of places\
on earth is the home--yes,\
4:15\
even your home.\
4:20\
Brethren, you bear\
the priesthood of God.\
4:23\
"The rights of the\
priesthood are inseparably\
4:26\
connected with the\
powers of heaven."\
4:30\
You and your family members have\
received priesthood ordinances.\
4:34\
It is "in the ordinances\
[of the priesthood],\
4:37\
[that] the power of\
godliness is manifest."\
4:40\
That power is available\
to you and your family\
4:44\
in your own home as you keep\
the covenants you have made.\
4:52\
Just 185 years ago--this\
very day--April 3, 1836,\
5:02\
Elijah restored the keys of\
the priesthood that allow\
5:06\
our families to be\
sealed together forever.\
5:12\
That is why it felt\
so good to administer\
5:14\
the sacrament in your home.\
5:17\
How do you think it\
affected your family members\
5:20\
to see you, their father,\
grandfather, husband, son,\
5:25\
or brother, administer\
this holy ordinance?\
5:31\
What will you do to retain that\
sacred feeling in your family?\
5:38\
You may feel that\
there is still more\
5:40\
you need to do to make your\
home truly a sanctuary of faith.\
5:44\
If so, please do it!\
5:49\
If you are married, counsel with\
your wife as your equal partner\
5:52\
in this crucial work.\
5:54\
There are few pursuits\
more important than this.\
6:00\
Between now and the time\
the Lord comes again,\
6:04\
we all need our\
homes to be places\
6:08\
of serenity and security.\
6:13\
Attitudes and actions\
that invite the Spirit\
6:16\
will increase the\
holiness of your home.\
6:20\
Equally certain is\
the fact that holiness\
6:23\
will vanish if there is anything\
in your behavior or environment\
6:27\
that offends the Holy Spirit,\
for then "the heavens withdraw\
6:32\
themselves."\
6:35\
Have you ever\
wondered why the Lord\
6:36\
wants us to make our\
homes the center of gospel\
6:41\
learning and gospel living?\
6:43\
It is not just to prepare\
us for, and help us through,\
6:47\
a pandemic.\
6:49\
Present restrictions on\
gathering will eventually end.\
6:54\
However, your commitment\
to make your home\
6:57\
your primary sanctuary of\
faith should never end.\
7:04\
As faith and holiness\
decrease in this fallen world,\
7:09\
your need for holy\
places will increase.\
7:14\
I urge you to continue to make\
your home a truly holy place,\
7:19\
"and be not moved" from\
that essential goal.\
7:27\
LESSON 2: We need each other.\
7:31\
God wants us to work\
together and help each other.\
7:37\
That is why He sends\
us to earth in families\
7:41\
and organizes us into\
wards and stakes.\
7:45\
That is why He asks us to serve\
and minister to each other.\
7:50\
That is why He asks us\
to live in the world\
7:54\
but not be of the world.\
7:58\
We can accomplish so much more\
together than we can alone.\
8:04\
God's plan of happiness\
would be frustrated\
8:07\
if His children remained\
isolated one from another.\
8:12\
The recent pandemic has\
been unique in that it\
8:15\
has affected\
everyone in the world\
8:18\
at essentially the same time.\
8:20\
While some have suffered\
more than others,\
8:24\
we have all been\
challenged in some way.\
8:28\
Because of this,\
our common trial\
8:31\
has the potential to help unite\
God's children as never before.\
8:37\
So, I ask, has this shared\
trial drawn you closer\
8:43\
to your neighbors--to your\
brothers and sisters across\
8:46\
the street and around the world?\
8:52\
In this regard, the\
two great commandments\
8:54\
can guide us: first, to\
love God, and second,\
8:58\
to love our neighbor.\
8:59\
We show our love by serving.\
9:01\
If you know of\
anyone who is alone,\
9:05\
reach out--even if\
you feel alone too!\
9:10\
You do not need to have a\
reason or a message or business\
9:15\
to transact.\
9:16\
Just say hello and\
show your love.\
9:23\
Technology can help you.\
9:25\
Pandemic or not, each\
precious child of God\
9:28\
needs to know that he\
or she is not alone!\
9:36\
LESSON 3: Your priesthood\
quorum is meant\
9:40\
for more than just a meeting.\
9:46\
During the pandemic,\
Sunday quorum meetings\
9:49\
were canceled for a time.\
9:51\
Some quorums are now\
able to meet virtually.\
9:55\
Nevertheless, the\
work that the Lord\
9:59\
has given to priesthood\
quorums was never\
10:01\
meant to be confined\
to a meeting.\
10:05\
Meetings are only a small part\
of what a quorum is meant for\
10:10\
and what it can do.\
10:14\
My brethren of the Aaronic\
Priesthood and elders\
10:16\
quorums, expand your vision\
of why we have quorums.\
10:21\
How does the Lord wish you would\
use your quorum to accomplish\
10:25\
His work--now?\
10:27\
Seek revelation from the Lord.\
10:29\
Humble yourself!\
10:30\
Ask!\
10:31\
Listen!\
10:33\
If you have been called to\
lead, counsel as a presidency\
10:37\
and with quorum members.\
10:39\
Whatever your priesthood\
office or calling,\
10:42\
let God prevail\
in your commitment\
10:45\
as a member of your quorum\
and in your service.\
10:49\
Experience with joy\
the righteousness\
10:52\
you will bring to pass as\
you are "anxiously engaged\
10:56\
in a good cause."\
10:59\
Quorums are in a unique\
position to accelerate\
11:03\
the gathering of Israel\
on both sides of the veil.\
11:11\
LESSON 4: We hear Jesus Christ\
better when we are still.\
11:21\
We live in a time prophesied\
long ago, when "all things\
11:28\
shall be in commotion; and\
surely, men's hearts shall\
11:32\
fail them; for fear shall\
come upon all people."\
11:38\
That was true\
before the pandemic,\
11:43\
and it will be true after.\
11:45\
Commotion in the world\
will continue to increase.\
11:50\
In contrast, the voice of the\
Lord is not "a voice of a great\
11:56\
tumultuous noise, but ... it\
[is] a still voice of perfect\
12:04\
mildness, [like] a whisper, and\
it [pierces] even to the very\
12:10\
soul."\
12:13\
In order to hear this still\
voice, you too must be still!\
12:24\
For a time, the pandemic\
has canceled activities that\
12:27\
would normally fill our lives.\
12:29\
Soon, we may be able to\
choose to fill that time again\
12:33\
with the noise and\
commotion of the world.\
12:35\
Or we can use our\
time to hear the voice\
12:40\
of the Lord whispering His\
guidance, comfort, and peace.\
12:47\
Quiet time is sacred time--time\
that will facilitate personal\
12:53\
revelation and instill peace.\
12:57\
Discipline yourself to have time\
alone and with your loved ones.\
13:03\
Open your heart\
to God in prayer.\
13:07\
Take time to immerse\
yourself in the scriptures\
13:10\
and worship in the temple.\
13:14\
My dear brethren,\
there are many things\
13:16\
the Lord wants us to\
learn from our experiences\
13:19\
during this pandemic.\
13:21\
I have listed only four.\
13:24\
I invite you to\
make your own list,\
13:27\
consider it carefully, and\
share it with those you love.\
13:32\
The future is bright for\
God's covenant-keeping people.\
13:37\
The Lord will increasingly call\
upon His servants who worthily\
13:41\
hold the priesthood to bless,\
comfort, and strengthen mankind\
13:47\
and to help prepare the\
world and its people\
13:50\
for His Second Coming.\
13:52\
It behooves each\
of us to measure up\
13:55\
to the sacred ordination\
we have received.\
13:58\
We can do this!\
14:01\
I so testify, with\
my expression of love\
14:05\
for each of you, my\
beloved brethren,\
14:09\
in the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
