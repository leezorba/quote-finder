In a Saturday evening meeting\
at a stake conference many years\
0:04\
ago, I met a woman who\
said her friends had asked\
0:08\
her to come back to church\
after many years of inactivity,\
0:13\
but she could not think of\
any reason why she should.\
0:16\
To encourage her, I\
said, "When you consider\
0:20\
all of the things the\
Savior has done for you,\
0:24\
you have many reasons to come\
back to worship and serve Him."\
0:29\
I was astonished\
when she replied,\
0:32\
"What's He done for me?"\
0:34\
What has Jesus Christ\
done for each of us?\
0:39\
He has done everything that\
is essential for our journey\
0:43\
through mortality toward\
the destiny outlined\
0:46\
in the plan of our\
Heavenly Father.\
0:49\
I will speak of four of\
the principal features\
0:53\
of that plan.\
0:55\
In each of these, His Only\
Begotten Son, Jesus Christ,\
0:59\
is the central figure.\
1:02\
Motivating all of this\
is "the love of God,\
1:07\
which sheddeth itself abroad\
in the hearts of the children\
1:11\
of men; wherefore, it\
is the most desirable\
1:15\
above all things."\
1:19\
Just before Easter Sunday,\
it is timely to speak\
1:21\
first of the Resurrection\
of Jesus Christ.\
1:25\
The Resurrection\
from the dead is\
1:27\
the reassuring personal\
pillar of our faith.\
1:31\
It adds meaning to our doctrine,\
motivation to our behavior,\
1:36\
and hope for our future.\
1:39\
Because we believe the Bible\
and Book of Mormon descriptions\
1:44\
of the literal Resurrection\
of Jesus Christ,\
1:48\
we also accept the numerous\
scriptural teachings\
1:52\
that a similar resurrection will\
come to all mortals who have\
1:56\
ever lived upon this earth.\
1:59\
As Jesus taught, "because I\
live, ye shall live also."\
2:04\
And His Apostle taught\
that "the dead shall\
2:08\
be raised incorruptible" and\
"this mortal [shall have]\
2:13\
put on immortality."\
2:17\
But the Resurrection gives\
us more than this assurance\
2:20\
of immortality.\
2:21\
It changes the way\
we view mortal life.\
2:25\
The Resurrection gives us the\
perspective and the strength\
2:29\
to endure the mortal\
challenges faced by each of us\
2:33\
and those we love.\
2:34\
It gives us a new way to\
view the physical, mental,\
2:38\
or emotional deficiencies\
we have at birth\
2:41\
or acquire during mortal life.\
2:44\
It gives us the strength to\
endure sorrows, failures,\
2:48\
and frustration.\
2:49\
Because each of us has\
an assured resurrection,\
2:53\
we know that these mortal\
deficiencies and oppositions\
2:57\
are only temporary.\
3:00\
The Resurrection also gives\
us a powerful incentive\
3:04\
to keep the commandments of\
God during our mortal lives.\
3:07\
When we rise from\
the dead and proceed\
3:10\
to our prophesied\
final judgment,\
3:13\
we want to have qualified for\
the choicest blessings promised\
3:18\
to resurrected beings.\
3:21\
In addition, the promise that\
the Resurrection can include\
3:24\
an opportunity to be with our\
family members--husband, wife,\
3:28\
children, parents, and\
posterity--is a powerful\
3:32\
encouragement to fulfill\
our family responsibilities\
3:37\
in mortality.\
3:38\
It also helps us live\
together in love in this life,\
3:43\
and it comforts us in the\
death of our loved ones.\
3:47\
We know that these mortal\
separations are only temporary,\
3:51\
and we anticipate future joyful\
reunions and associations.\
3:58\
The Resurrection provides\
us hope and the strength\
4:01\
to be patient as we wait.\
4:04\
It also prepared us with the\
courage and dignity to face\
4:09\
our own death--even a death\
that might be called premature.\
4:15\
All of these effects\
of the Resurrection\
4:18\
are part of the first\
answer to the question "What\
4:21\
has Jesus Christ done for me?"\
4:26\
For most of us, the opportunity\
to be forgiven of our sins\
4:29\
is the major meaning of the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
4:33\
In worship, we reverently sing:\
"His precious blood he freely\
4:39\
spilt; His life he freely gave,\
A sinless sacrifice for guilt,\
4:46\
A dying world to save."\
4:49\
Our Savior and Redeemer endured\
incomprehensible suffering\
4:54\
to become a sacrifice for\
the sins of all mortals who\
4:58\
would repent.\
4:59\
This atoning sacrifice offered\
the ultimate good--the pure\
5:05\
lamb without blemish--for the\
ultimate measure of evil--the\
5:09\
sins of the entire world.\
5:12\
It opened the door\
for each of us\
5:15\
to be cleansed of\
our personal sins\
5:18\
so we can be readmitted to the\
presence of God, our Eternal\
5:22\
Father.\
5:23\
This open door is available\
to all of the children of God.\
5:32\
In worship we sing: "I\
marvel that he would descend\
5:36\
from his throne\
divine, To rescue\
5:39\
a soul so rebellious\
and proud as mine,\
5:43\
That he should extend his\
great love unto such as I."\
5:51\
The magnificent and\
incomprehensible effect\
5:53\
of the Atonement of\
Jesus Christ is based\
5:57\
on God's love for each of us.\
6:00\
It affirms His declaration\
that "the worth of souls"--ever\
6:05\
one--"is great in\
the sight of God."\
6:09\
In the Bible, Jesus\
Christ explained this\
6:12\
in terms of Heavenly\
Father's love:\
6:15\
"For God so loved the world,\
that he gave his only begotten\
6:19\
Son, that whosoever believeth\
in him should not perish,\
6:24\
but have everlasting life."\
6:28\
In modern revelation,\
our Redeemer Jesus Christ\
6:32\
declared that He\
"so loved the world\
6:36\
that he gave his own life,\
that as many as would believe\
6:39\
might become the sons of God."\
6:44\
Is it any wonder, then,\
that the Book of Mormon:\
6:46\
Another Testament\
of Christ concludes\
6:49\
with the teaching that to\
become "perfect" and "sanctified\
6:53\
in Christ" we must\
"love God with all [our]\
6:57\
might, mind and strength"?\
7:01\
His plan, motivated by love,\
must be received with love.\
7:08\
What else has our Savior,\
Jesus Christ, done for us?\
7:12\
Through the teachings\
of His prophets\
7:15\
and through His\
personal ministry,\
7:17\
Jesus taught us the\
plan of salvation.\
7:21\
This plan includes the\
Creation, the purpose of life,\
7:26\
the necessity of opposition,\
and the gift of agency.\
7:31\
He also taught us the\
commandments and covenants\
7:34\
we must obey and the ordinances\
we must experience to take us\
7:39\
back to our heavenly parents.\
7:42\
In the Bible we\
read His teaching:\
7:45\
"I am the light of\
the world: he that\
7:48\
followeth me shall\
not walk in darkness,\
7:52\
but shall have the\
light of life."\
7:54\
And in modern revelation\
we read, "Behold,\
7:58\
I am Jesus Christ, ... a\
light which cannot be hid\
8:01\
in darkness."\
8:04\
If we follow His teachings, He\
lights our path in this life\
8:07\
and assures our\
destiny in the next.\
8:11\
Because He loves\
us, He challenges\
8:14\
us to focus on Him\
instead of the things\
8:18\
of this mortal world.\
8:19\
In His great sermon\
on the bread of life,\
8:22\
Jesus taught that we should\
not be among those who are most\
8:27\
attracted to the things of the\
world--the things that sustain\
8:31\
life on earth but give no\
nourishment toward eternal\
8:34\
life.\
8:35\
As Jesus invited us again and\
again and again, "follow me."\
8:45\
Finally, the Book of Mormon\
teaches that as part of His\
8:48\
Atonement, Jesus Christ\
"suffer[ed] pains\
8:52\
and afflictions and\
temptations of every kind;\
8:55\
and this that the word might be\
fulfilled which saith he will\
8:59\
take upon him the pains and\
the sicknesses of his people."\
9:05\
Why did our Savior suffer\
these mortal challenges\
9:08\
"of every kind"?\
9:10\
Alma explained: "And\
he will take upon him\
9:14\
their infirmities, that his\
bowels may be filled with\
9:18\
mercy, according to the flesh,\
that he may know according\
9:22\
to the flesh how to\
succor--which means to give\
9:26\
relief or aid to--his\
people according\
9:30\
to their infirmities."\
9:33\
Our Savior feels and knows our\
temptations, our struggles,\
9:37\
our heartaches,\
and our suffering,\
9:40\
for He willingly\
experienced them\
9:43\
all as part of His Atonement.\
9:46\
Other scriptures affirm this.\
9:48\
The New Testament\
declares, "in that he\
9:50\
himself hath suffered\
being tempted,\
9:53\
he is able to succor\
them that are tempted."\
9:57\
Isaiah teaches, "Fear thou\
not; for I am with thee: ...\
10:01\
I will strengthen thee;\
yea, I will help thee."\
10:07\
All who suffer any kind\
of mortal infirmities\
10:10\
should remember that our Savior\
experienced that kind of pain\
10:14\
also, and that through His\
Atonement He offers each of us\
10:19\
the strength to bear it.\
10:23\
The Prophet Joseph\
Smith summarized\
10:25\
all of this in our\
third Article of Faith:\
10:28\
"We believe that through\
the Atonement of Christ,\
10:32\
all mankind may be saved,\
by obedience to the laws\
10:38\
and ordinances of the gospel."\
10:43\
"What has Jesus Christ done\
for me?" that sister asked.\
10:47\
Under the plan of\
our Heavenly Father,\
10:50\
He "created the heavens and\
the earth" so that each of us\
10:54\
could have the mortal\
experience necessary to seek\
10:58\
our divine destiny.\
11:00\
As part of the Father's\
plan, the Resurrection\
11:04\
of Jesus Christ overcame\
death to assure each of us\
11:08\
immortality.\
11:10\
Jesus Christ's atoning\
sacrifice gives each of us\
11:14\
the opportunity to\
repent of our sins\
11:17\
and return clean to\
our Heavenly Home.\
11:20\
His commandments and\
covenants show us the way,\
11:24\
and His priesthood\
gives the authority\
11:27\
to perform the ordinances\
that are essential to reach\
11:31\
that destiny.\
11:34\
And our Savior willingly\
experienced all mortal pains\
11:38\
and infirmities that He would\
know how to strengthen us\
11:43\
in our afflictions.\
11:47\
Jesus Christ did all of\
this because He loves\
11:51\
all of the children of God.\
11:54\
Love is the motivation\
for it all, and it was so\
11:58\
from the very beginning.\
12:00\
God has told us in modern\
revelation that "he created ...\
12:05\
male and female, after\
his own image ... ;\
12:09\
And [He] gave unto them\
commandments that they should\
12:13\
love and serve him."\
12:17\
I testify of all\
of this and pray\
12:20\
that we all will remember what\
our Savior has done for each\
12:24\
of us and that we all\
will love and serve Him,\
12:30\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
