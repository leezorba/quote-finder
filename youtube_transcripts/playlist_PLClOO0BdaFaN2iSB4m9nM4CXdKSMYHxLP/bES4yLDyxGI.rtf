0:12\
the Council on the\

Church Auditing, which consists\
of credentialed professionals\
0:35\
and is independent of all other\
0:37\
Church departments and\
entities, has responsibility\
0:41\
to perform audits for\
the purpose of providing\
0:45\
reasonable assurance regarding\
contributions received,\
0:48\
expenditures made, and\
safeguarding of Church assets.\
0:53\
Based upon audits\
performed, Church Auditing\
0:56\
is of the opinion that,\
in all material respects,\
0:59\
contributions received,\
expenditures made,\
1:02\
and assets of the\
Church for the year 2020\
1:05\
have been recorded\
and administered\
1:08\
in accordance with approved\
Church budgets, policies,\
1:12\
and accounting practices.\
1:14\
The Church follows the practices\
taught to its members of living\
1:18\
within a\
1:18\
budget, avoiding debt, and\
saving against a time of need.\

Auditing Department, Jared B.\
