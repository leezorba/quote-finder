In 1946, the young\
researcher Arthur Hasler\
0:04\
was hiking along a mountain\
stream near his boyhood home\
0:08\
when he had an\
experience that led\
0:11\
to an important discovery about\
how fish find their way back\
0:15\
to their birth streams.\
0:17\
Hiking up a mountain, yet out of\
sight of his favorite childhood\
0:21\
waterfall, Hasler was\
suddenly brought back\
0:24\
to a forgotten memory.\
0:26\
He said, "as a cool breeze,\
bearing the fragrance of mosses\
0:30\
and columbine, swept\
around the rocky abutment,\
0:34\
the details of this\
waterfall and its setting\
0:37\
on the face of mountain suddenly\
leapt into my mind's eye."\
0:43\
These smells rekindled\
his childhood memories\
0:46\
and reminded him of home.\
0:49\
If smells could trigger\
such memories for him,\
0:52\
he reasoned that perhaps smells\
could be as evocative to salmon\
0:58\
who, after years of\
being in the open ocean,\
1:01\
return to the exact stream\
of their birth to spawn.\
1:05\
Based on this\
experience, Hasler,\
1:07\
together with other\
researchers, went on\
1:10\
to demonstrate that salmon\
remember the very scents that\
1:14\
would help them navigate\
thousands of miles\
1:17\
to find their way\
back from the sea.\
1:21\
This account caused\
me to think that one\
1:24\
of the most important things\
we can do in this life\
1:28\
is to recognize and remember\
the pathway back to our Heavenly\
1:32\
Father and faithfully\
and joyfully persevere\
1:36\
throughout the journey.\
1:38\
I thought of four\
reminders that, when\
1:41\
used and applied\
consistently in our lives,\
1:44\
can rekindle feelings\
of our heavenly home.\
1:47\
First, we can remember that\
we are children of God.\
1:52\
We have a divine heritage.\
1:54\
Knowing that we\
are children of God\
1:57\
and that He wants us to\
return to His presence\
1:59\
is one of the first\
steps on the journey back\
2:03\
to our heavenly home.\
2:05\
Remind yourself\
of this heritage.\
2:07\
Make time regularly to boost\
your spiritual immune system\
2:11\
by remembering the blessings\
you have received from the Lord.\
2:15\
Trust the guides you have\
been given from Him, rather\
2:19\
than turning solely to the world\
to measure your personal worth\
2:23\
and find your way.\
2:26\
Recently I visited a\
loved one after she\
2:29\
had been in the hospital.\
2:30\
She told me with\
emotion that while she\
2:33\
was lying in the\
hospital bed, all\
2:36\
she desired was for someone\
to sing to her the song,\
2:39\
"I Am a Child of God."\
2:42\
That thought alone,\
she said, gave her\
2:45\
the peace she needed in\
that hour of affliction.\
2:49\
Knowing who you are changes\
what you feel and what you do.\
2:55\
Understanding who\
you truly are better\
2:58\
prepares you to\
recognize and remember\
3:01\
your way back to our heavenly\
home and yearn to be there.\
3:06\
Second, we can remember the\
foundation that protects us.\
3:10\
Strength comes to us when\
we remain righteous, true,\
3:15\
and faithful to Heavenly Father\
and Jesus Christ, even when\
3:19\
others\
3:19\
overwhelmingly disregard the\
commandments and the principles\
3:23\
of salvation.\
3:25\
In the Book of Mormon,\
Helaman taught his sons\
3:28\
to remember that\
they must build their\
3:31\
foundations on Jesus\
Christ in order\
3:35\
to have the strength to\
withstand the temptations\
3:39\
of the adversary.\
3:40\
Satan's mighty winds and\
storms are beating upon us,\
3:45\
but they will have no power\
to drag us down if we put\
3:50\
our trust in the safest\
place--in our Redeemer.\
3:55\
I know from personal\
experience that as we\
3:58\
choose to hear His\
voice and follow Him,\
4:01\
we will receive His help.\
4:03\
We will obtain a\
wider perspective\
4:05\
of our circumstances and\
a deeper understanding\
4:09\
of the purpose of life.\
4:11\
We will feel the\
spiritual stirrings that\
4:14\
will guide us to heavenly home.\
4:17\
Third, we can remember\
to be prayerful.\
4:21\
We live in a time when, with a\
single touch or voice command,\
4:26\
we can begin\
searching for answers\
4:28\
on almost any topic in\
the immensity of data\
4:31\
stored and organized in a\
vast and complex network\
4:35\
of computers.\
4:37\
On the other hand, we\
have the simplicity\
4:40\
of the invitation to begin\
seeking answers from heaven.\
4:44\
"Pray always and I will pour\
out my Spirit upon you,"\
4:48\
the Lord promises, "and great\
shall be your blessing--yea,\
4:52\
even more than if you should\
obtain treasures of earth."\
4:58\
God is fully aware\
of each one of us\
5:01\
and ready to listen\
to our prayers.\
5:04\
When we remember to pray,\
we find His sustaining love,\
5:08\
and the more we pray\
to our Father in Heaven\
5:11\
in Christ's name, the more we\
bring the Savior into our life\
5:16\
and the better we will\
recognize the path\
5:19\
He has marked to\
our heavenly home.\
5:22\
Fourth, we can remember\
to serve others.\
5:26\
As we strive to follow Jesus\
Christ by serving and showing\
5:31\
kindness to others, we make\
the world a better place.\
5:35\
Our actions can\
significantly bless\
5:38\
the lives of those around us\
and our own lives as well.\
5:43\
Loving service adds meaning\
to the lives of both\
5:46\
the giver and the receiver.\
5:49\
Do not underestimate\
the potential\
5:52\
you have to influence\
others for good,\
5:54\
both by the service\
of your actions\
5:57\
and by the service\
of your example.\
6:00\
Loving service to others\
guides us along the path\
6:05\
to our heavenly home--the path\
of becoming like our Savior.\
6:12\
In 1975, as a result\
of a civil war,\
6:15\
Arnaldo and Eugenia Teles\
Grilo and their children\
6:19\
had to leave behind\
their home and all\
6:21\
that they had built through\
decades of hard work.\
6:25\
In their native country of\
Portugal, Brother and Sister\
6:28\
Teles Grilo faced the challenge\
of starting all over again.\
6:33\
But years later, after\
joining The Church\
6:36\
of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints,\
6:38\
they said, "We lost\
everything we had,\
6:41\
but it was a good\
thing because it\
6:44\
compelled us to\
consider the importance\
6:47\
of eternal blessings."\
6:49\
They lost their earthly home,\
but they found the way back\
6:54\
to their heavenly home.\
6:55\
Whatever you must\
leave behind to follow\
6:58\
the path to heavenly home will\
one day seem like no sacrifice\
7:04\
at all.\
7:06\
We have Jesus Christ's\
perfect example to follow,\
7:10\
and the journey toward our\
eternal home is possible only\
7:14\
because of His\
teachings, His life,\
7:17\
and His atoning\
sacrifice--including His death,\
7:20\
and glorious Resurrection.\
7:23\
I invite you to experience\
the joy of remembering\
7:27\
that we are children of\
God, that He so loved\
7:30\
the world that He has sent\
His Son to show us the path.\
7:34\
I invite you to\
remember to be faithful,\
7:37\
to turn your life to\
the Savior and build\
7:40\
your foundation on Him.\
7:42\
Remember to be prayerful\
in your journey,\
7:45\
and serve others along the way.\
7:48\
Dear brothers and sisters,\
on this Easter Sunday,\
7:52\
I bear testimony that Jesus\
Christ is the Redeemer\
7:57\
and Savior of the world.\
7:59\
He is the one that can usher us\
to the table of a joyful life\
8:04\
and guide us in our journey.\
8:07\
May we remember and\
follow Him home.\
8:11\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
