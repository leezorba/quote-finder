In 1994, a genocide took place\
in the east African country\
0:06\
of Rwanda that was partly due to\
0:08\
deep-seated tribal tensions.\
0:10\
Estimates are that more than\
half a million people were\
0:13\
killed.\
0:14\
Remarkably, the Rwandan people\
have in large part reconciled,\
0:19\
but these events\
continue to reverberate.\
0:23\
A decade ago, while\
visiting Rwanda,\
0:25\
my wife and I struck up a\
conversation with another\
0:28\
passenger at the Kigali airport.\
0:31\
He lamented the unfairness of\
the genocide and poignantly\
0:35\
asked, "If there were\
a God, wouldn't He\
0:39\
have done something about it?"\
0:42\
For this man--and for many\
of us--suffering and brutal\
0:47\
unfairness can seem incompatible\
with the reality of a kind,\
0:52\
loving Heavenly Father.\
0:54\
Yet He is real, He is kind, and\
He loves each of His children\
0:59\
perfectly.\
1:01\
This dichotomy is as old as\
mankind and cannot be explained\
1:06\
in a simple sound bite\
or on a bumper sticker.\
1:10\
To begin to make\
some sense of it,\
1:12\
let us explore various\
types of unfairness.\
1:16\
Consider a family in\
which each child received\
1:19\
a weekly monetary allowance for\
doing common household chores.\
1:24\
One son, John, purchased\
candy; one daughter, Anna,\
1:29\
saved her money.\
1:31\
Eventually, Anna bought\
herself a bicycle.\
1:34\
John thought it\
was totally unfair\
1:37\
that Anna got a bike when\
1:39\
he didn't.\
1:40\
But John's choices created\
the inequality, not\
1:44\
parental actions.\
1:45\
Anna's decision to forgo\
the immediate gratification\
1:49\
of eating candy didn't\
impose any unfairness on John\
1:53\
because he had the same\
opportunity as his sister.\
1:58\
Our decisions can likewise\
yield long-term advantages\
2:01\
or disadvantages.\
2:03\
As the Lord revealed,\
"If a person\
2:06\
gains more knowledge and\
intelligence in this life\
2:09\
through his diligence and\
obedience than another,\
2:12\
he will have so much the\
advantage in the world\
2:15\
to come."\
2:17\
When others receive benefits\
because of their diligent\
2:20\
choices, we cannot rightly\
2:23\
conclude that we have been\
treated unfairly when we\
2:26\
have had the same opportunity.\
2:29\
Another example of\
unfairness stems\
2:32\
from a situation my wife,\
Ruth, encountered as a child.\
2:35\
One day, Ruth learned\
that her mother\
2:38\
was taking a younger sister,\
Merla, to buy new shoes.\
2:43\
Ruth complained,\
"Mom, it's so unfair!\
2:47\
Merla got the last\
new pair of shoes."\
2:50\
Ruth's mother asked,\
"Ruth, do your shoes fit?"\
2:54\
Ruth replied, "Well, yes."\
2:58\
Ruth's mother then said,\
"Merla's shoes no longer fit."\
3:03\
Ruth agreed that every child\
in the family should have shoes\
3:07\
that fit.\
3:08\
Although Ruth would have liked\
new shoes, her perception\
3:12\
of being treated unfairly\
3:13\
dissipated when she\
saw the circumstances\
3:17\
through her mother's eyes.\
3:19\
Some unfairness\
cannot be explained;\
3:23\
inexplicable unfairness\
is infuriating.\
3:27\
Unfairness comes from living\
with bodies that are imperfect,\
3:31\
injured, or diseased.\
3:33\
Mortal life is\
inherently unfair.\
3:36\
Some people are born in\
affluence; others are not.\
3:41\
Some have loving\
parents; others do not.\
3:45\
Some live many\
years, others few.\
3:49\
And on and on and on.\
3:54\
Some individuals make\
injurious mistakes even when\
3:57\
they are trying to do good.\
3:59\
Some choose not to alleviate\
unfairness when they could.\
4:04\
Distressingly, some individuals\
use their God-given agency\
4:09\
to hurt others when\
they never should.\
4:13\
Different types\
of unfairness can\
4:15\
merge, creating a tsunami\
of overwhelming unfairness.\
4:20\
For instance, the COVID-19\
pandemic disproportionately\
4:25\
affects those who already are\
subject to multifactorial,\
4:29\
underlying disadvantages.\
4:33\
My heart aches for those\
who face such unfairness,\
4:38\
but I declare with\
all my aching heart\
4:42\
that Jesus Christ both\
understands unfairness and has\
4:47\
the power to provide a remedy.\
4:49\
Nothing compares to the\
unfairness He endured.\
4:52\
It wasn't fair that He\
experienced all the pains\
4:56\
and afflictions of mankind.\
4:57\
It wasn't fair that He suffered\
for my sins and mistakes\
5:01\
and for yours.\
5:02\
But He chose to do so\
because of His love for us\
5:05\
and for Heavenly Father.\
5:07\
He understands perfectly\
what we are experiencing.\
5:12\
Scripture records that ancient\
Israelites complained that God\
5:16\
was treating them unfairly.\
5:18\
In response, Jehovah\
asked, "For can a woman\
5:23\
forget her sucking child, that\
she should not have compassion\
5:26\
on the son of her womb?"\
5:29\
As unlikely as it is that a\
loving mother would forget\
5:32\
her infant child, Jehovah\
declared that His devotion\
5:36\
was even more steadfast.\
5:39\
He affirmed, "Yea,\
they may forget,\
5:43\
yet will I not forget thee. ...\
5:47\
Behold, I have graven thee\
upon the palms of my hands;\
5:51\
thy walls are\
continually before me."\
5:56\
Because Jesus Christ endured\
the infinite, atoning sacrifice,\
6:00\
He empathizes perfectly with us.\
6:03\
He is always aware of us\
and our circumstances.\
6:07\
In mortality, we can "come\
boldly" to the Savior\
6:11\
and receive compassion,\
healing, and help.\
6:14\
Even while we\
suffer inexplicably,\
6:17\
God can bless us in simple,\
ordinary, and significant ways.\
6:22\
As we learn to recognize these\
blessings, our trust in God\
6:26\
will increase.\
6:27\
In the eternities, Heavenly\
Father and Jesus Christ\
6:30\
will resolve all unfairness.\
6:33\
We understandably want\
to know how and when.\
6:38\
How are They going to do that?\
6:41\
When are They going to do it?\
6:43\
To my knowledge, They\
haven't revealed how or when.\
6:49\
What I do know is\
that They will.\
6:54\
In unfair situations,\
one of our tasks\
6:57\
is to trust that "all\
that is unfair about life\
7:01\
can be made right through the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ."\
7:05\
Jesus Christ overcame the world\
and "absorbed" all unfairness.\
7:11\
Because of Him, we can\
have peace in this world\
7:14\
and be of good cheer.\
7:16\
If we let Him, Jesus Christ\
will consecrate the unfairness\
7:21\
for our gain.\
7:24\
He will not just console us\
and restore what was lost;\
7:27\
He will use the unfairness\
for our benefit.\
7:31\
When it comes to\
how and when, we\
7:34\
need to recognize and accept,\
as did Alma, "it mattereth not;\
7:40\
for God knoweth\
all these things;\
7:42\
and it sufficeth me to know\
that this is the case."\
7:47\
We can try to hold our questions\
about how and when for later\
7:51\
and focus on developing faith in\
Jesus Christ--that He has both\
7:56\
the power to make everything\
right and yearns to do so.\
8:01\
For us to insist on\
knowing how or when\
8:04\
is unproductive and,\
after all, myopic.\
8:10\
As we develop faith\
in Jesus Christ,\
8:13\
we should also strive\
to become like Him.\
8:16\
We then approach\
others with compassion\
8:19\
and try to alleviate\
unfairness where we find it;\
8:23\
we can try to make things right\
within our sphere of influence.\
8:27\
Indeed, the Savior directed that\
we "should be anxiously engaged\
8:32\
in a good cause, and\
do many things of [our]\
8:35\
own free will, [to] bring\
to pass much righteousness."\
8:39\
Someone who has been anxiously\
engaged in combating unfairness\
8:43\
is attorney Bryan Stevenson.\
8:46\
His legal practice\
in the United States\
8:49\
is dedicated to defending\
the wrongly accused,\
8:52\
ending excessive punishment, and\
protecting basic human rights.\
8:58\
Some years ago, Mr.\
Stevenson defended\
9:00\
a man who had been falsely\
accused of murder and\
9:04\
was condemned to die.\
9:06\
Mr. Stevenson asked the\
man's local Christian church\
9:10\
for support, even though the\
man was not active in his church\
9:14\
and was disparaged in the\
community due to a widely\
9:17\
known extramarital affair.\
9:21\
To focus the congregation\
on what really mattered,\
9:24\
Mr. Stevenson spoke to\
them about the woman\
9:27\
accused of adultery who\
was brought to Jesus.\
9:30\
The accusers wanted to stone\
her to death, but Jesus said,\
9:35\
"He that is without sin ...\
, let him first cast a stone\
9:39\
at her."\
9:41\
The woman's accusers withdrew.\
9:44\
Jesus did not condemn the woman\
but charged her to sin no more.\
9:50\
After recounting this\
episode, Mr. Stevenson\
9:53\
observed that\
self-righteousness, fear,\
9:57\
and anger have caused even\
Christians to hurl stones\
10:01\
at people who stumble.\
10:03\
He then said, "We can't\
simply watch that happen,"\
10:08\
and he encouraged\
the congregants\
10:11\
to become "stone catchers."\
10:15\
Brothers and sisters,\
not throwing stones\
10:18\
is the first step in treating\
others with compassion.\
10:22\
The second step is to try to\
catch stones thrown by others.\
10:27\
How we deal with advantages and\
10:30\
disadvantages is\
part of life's test.\
10:34\
We will be judged\
not so much by what\
10:35\
we say but by how we treat the\
vulnerable and disadvantaged.\
10:40\
As Latter-day Saints, we seek\
to follow the Savior's example,\
10:44\
to go about doing good.\
10:46\
We demonstrate our\
love for our neighbor\
10:49\
by working to ensure the\
dignity of all Heavenly Father's\
10:53\
children.\
10:56\
With our own advantages\
and disadvantages in mind,\
10:59\
reflection is healthy.\
11:01\
For John to understand why Anna\
got the bike was revealing.\
11:07\
For Ruth to view Merla's need\
for shoes through her mother's\
11:12\
eyes was enlightening.\
11:14\
To try to see things with\
an eternal perspective\
11:17\
can be clarifying.\
11:19\
As we become more\
like the Savior,\
11:22\
we develop more empathy,\
understanding, and charity.\
11:28\
I return to the question\
posed by our fellow passenger\
11:31\
in Kigali, when he lamented\
the unfairness of the Rwandan\
11:35\
genocide and asked,\
"If there were a God,\
11:39\
wouldn't He have done\
something about it?"\
11:43\
Without minimizing the\
suffering caused by the genocide\
11:46\
and after acknowledging\
our inability\
11:49\
to comprehend such\
suffering, we replied\
11:53\
that Jesus Christ\
has done something\
11:56\
about infuriating unfairness.\
11:59\
We explained many\
gospel precepts\
12:01\
concerning Jesus Christ and\
the Restoration of His Church.\
12:05\
Afterwards, our acquaintance\
asked, with tears in his eyes,\
12:10\
"You mean there is something\
I can do for my dead parents\
12:13\
and uncle?"\
12:15\
We said, "Oh, yes!"\
12:18\
We then testified that all\
that's unfair about life\
12:23\
can be made right through\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ\
12:26\
and that by His\
authority, families\
12:29\
can be joined together forever.\
12:33\
When faced with unfairness,\
we can push ourselves away\
12:37\
from God or we can\
be drawn toward Him\
12:40\
for help and support.\
12:42\
For example, the\
prolonged warfare\
12:44\
between the Nephites\
and the Lamanites\
12:46\
affected people differently.\
12:48\
Mormon observed that\
"many had become\
12:51\
hardened" while others\
"were softened because\
12:54\
of their afflictions,\
insomuch that they did humble\
12:57\
themselves before God."\
13:01\
Don't let unfairness harden you\
or corrode your faith in God.\
13:07\
Instead, ask God for help.\
13:11\
Increase your appreciation for\
and reliance on the Savior.\
13:16\
Rather than becoming bitter,\
let Him help you become better.\
13:22\
Allow Him to help\
you persevere, to let\
13:27\
your afflictions be "swallowed\
up in the joy of Christ."\
13:30\
Join Him in His mission to\
"heal the brokenhearted";\
13:35\
strive to mitigate unfairness,\
and become a stone catcher.\
13:42\
I testify that the Savior lives.\
13:46\
He understands unfairness.\
13:50\
The marks in the\
palms of His hands\
13:53\
continually remind Him of\
you and your circumstances.\
13:58\
He ministers to you in all your\
14:01\
distress.\
14:03\
For those who come to\
Him, a crown of beauty\
14:07\
will replace the\
ashes of mourning;\
14:09\
joy and gladness will\
replace grief and sorrow;\
14:14\
appreciation and\
celebration will replace\
14:17\
discouragement and despair.\
14:20\
Your faith in Heavenly Father\
and Jesus Christ will be\
14:24\
rewarded more than\
you can imagine.\
14:27\
All unfairness--especially\
infuriating unfairness--will be\
14:33\
consecrated for your gain.\
14:35\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
