In this troubled\
time, I have felt\
0:03\
to speak about the inspired\
Constitution of the United\
0:07\
States.\
0:08\
This Constitution is\
of special importance\
0:12\
to our members in\
the United States,\
0:15\
but it is also a common\
heritage of constitutions\
0:19\
around the world.\
0:22\
A constitution is the\
foundation of government.\
0:25\
It provides structure and\
limits for the exercise\
0:29\
of government powers.\
0:31\
The United States Constitution\
is the oldest written\
0:36\
constitution still\
in force today.\
0:39\
Though originally adopted\
by only a small number\
0:43\
of colonies, it soon\
became a model worldwide.\
0:48\
Today, every nation\
except three have\
0:52\
adopted written constitutions.\
0:56\
In these remarks I do not\
speak for any political party\
1:00\
or other group.\
1:02\
I speak for the United States\
Constitution, which I have\
1:06\
studied for more than 60 years.\
1:10\
I speak from my\
experience as a law clerk\
1:13\
to the chief justice of the\
United States Supreme Court.\
1:17\
I speak from my 15 years\
as a professor of law\
1:22\
and my three and a half and\
a half years as a justice\
1:26\
on the Utah Supreme Court.\
1:28\
Most importantly, I\
speak from 37 years\
1:32\
as an Apostle of Jesus\
Christ, responsible to study\
1:37\
the meaning of the divinely\
inspired United States\
1:41\
Constitution to the work\
of His restored Church.\
1:49\
The United States\
Constitution is unique\
1:51\
because God revealed\
that He "established" it\
1:55\
"for the rights and\
protection of all flesh."\
2:01\
That is why this Constitution\
is of special concern\
2:05\
for The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day\
2:08\
Saints throughout the world.\
2:10\
Whether or how its\
principles should\
2:13\
be applied in other\
nations of the world\
2:16\
is for them to decide.\
2:20\
What was God's purpose in\
establishing the United States\
2:23\
Constitution?\
2:25\
We see it in the\
doctrine of moral agency.\
2:30\
In the first decade of\
the restored Church,\
2:33\
its members on the\
Western frontier\
2:36\
were suffering private\
and public persecution.\
2:40\
Partly this was because\
of their opposition\
2:44\
to the human slavery then\
existing in the United States.\
2:50\
In these unfortunate\
circumstances,\
2:53\
God revealed through the Prophet\
Joseph Smith eternal truths\
2:58\
about His doctrine.\
3:01\
God has given His children moral\
agency--the power to decide\
3:07\
and to act.\
3:08\
The most desirable condition\
for the exercise of that agency\
3:13\
is maximum freedom\
for men and women\
3:17\
to act according to\
their individual choices.\
3:21\
Then, the revelation\
explains, "every man\
3:25\
may be accountable for his own\
sins in the day of judgment.\
3:30\
Therefore," the\
Lord revealed, "it\
3:33\
is not right that any man should\
be in bondage one to another."\
3:39\
This obviously means that\
human slavery is wrong.\
3:43\
And according to\
the same principle,\
3:46\
it is wrong for citizens\
to have no voice\
3:50\
in the selection of their rulers\
or the making of their laws.\
3:55\
Our belief that the\
United States Constitution\
3:58\
was divinely inspired does not\
mean that divine revelation\
4:03\
dictated every word and\
phrase, such as the provisions\
4:07\
allocating the number of\
representatives from each state\
4:10\
or the minimum age of each.\
4:13\
The Constitution was not\
"a fully grown document,"\
4:17\
said President J. Reuben Clark.\
4:20\
"On the contrary,"\
he explained, "we\
4:22\
believe it must grow and\
develop to meet the changing\
4:26\
needs of an advancing world."\
4:29\
For example, inspired\
amendments abolished slavery\
4:35\
and gave women\
the right to vote.\
4:38\
However, we do not\
see inspiration\
4:41\
in every Supreme Court decision\
interpreting the Constitution.\
4:48\
I believe the United\
States Constitution\
4:50\
contains at least five\
divinely inspired principles.\
4:56\
First is the principle that\
the source of government power\
5:00\
is the people.\
5:02\
In a time when sovereign\
power was universally\
5:06\
assumed to come from the\
divine right of kings\
5:10\
or from military power,\
attributing sovereign power\
5:15\
to the people was revolutionary.\
5:18\
Philosophers had advocated\
this, but the United States\
5:22\
Constitution was the\
first to apply it.\
5:25\
Sovereign power in\
the people does not\
5:29\
mean that mobs or\
other groups of people\
5:32\
can intervene to intimidate\
or force government action.\
5:37\
The Constitution established\
a constitutional democratic\
5:42\
republic, where the people\
exercise their power\
5:46\
through their elected\
representatives.\
5:51\
A second inspired\
principle is the division\
5:53\
of delegated power between\
the nation and its subsidiary\
5:58\
states.\
5:59\
In our federal system, this\
unprecedented principle\
6:04\
has sometimes been altered\
by inspired amendments,\
6:08\
such as those abolishing slavery\
and extending voting rights\
6:12\
to women, mentioned earlier.\
6:14\
Significantly, the United\
States Constitution\
6:18\
limits the national government\
to the exercise of powers\
6:23\
granted expressly\
or by implication,\
6:26\
and it reserves all\
other government powers\
6:30\
"to the States respectively,\
or to the people."\
6:36\
Another inspired principle\
is the separation of powers.\
6:41\
Well over a century before our\
1787 Constitutional Convention,\
6:47\
the English Parliament\
pioneered the separation\
6:50\
of legislative and\
executive authority\
6:53\
when they wrested certain\
powers from the king.\
6:57\
The inspiration in the\
American convention\
7:00\
was to delegate independent\
executive, legislative,\
7:05\
and judicial powers so these\
three branches could exercise\
7:10\
checks upon one another.\
7:15\
A fourth inspired\
principle is in the cluster\
7:18\
of vital guarantees\
of individual rights\
7:22\
and specific limits on\
government authority\
7:25\
in the Bill of Rights,\
adopted by amendment\
7:29\
just three years after the\
Constitution went into force.\
7:33\
A Bill of Rights was not new.\
7:35\
Here, the inspiration was in\
the practical implementation\
7:40\
of principles pioneered\
in England, beginning\
7:43\
with the Magna Carta.\
7:45\
The writers of the Constitution\
were familiar with these\
7:49\
because some of the colonial\
charters had such guarantees.\
7:54\
Without a Bill of\
Rights, America\
7:57\
could not have served\
as the host nation\
8:00\
for the Restoration\
of the gospel, which\
8:03\
began just three decades later.\
8:08\
There was divine inspiration\
in the original provision\
8:11\
that there should\
be no religious test\
8:14\
for public office,\
but the addition\
8:18\
of the religious freedom and\
anti-establishment guarantees\
8:23\
in the First\
Amendment was vital.\
8:27\
We also see divine inspiration\
in the First Amendment's\
8:30\
freedoms of speech and press\
and in the personal protections\
8:35\
in other amendments, such as\
for criminal prosecutions.\
8:41\
Fifth and finally, I\
see divine inspiration\
8:45\
in the vital purpose of\
the entire Constitution.\
8:50\
We are to be governed by\
law and not by individuals,\
8:55\
and our loyalty is to the\
Constitution and its principles\
9:00\
and processes, not\
to any officeholder.\
9:05\
In this way, all persons are\
to be equal before the law.\
9:10\
These principles block\
the autocratic ambitions\
9:14\
that have corrupted\
democracy in some countries.\
9:18\
They also mean that none of the\
three branches of government\
9:23\
should be dominant\
over the others\
9:25\
or prevent the others\
from performing\
9:28\
their proper constitutional\
functions to check one another.\
9:35\
Despite the divinely inspired\
principles of the United States\
9:39\
Constitution, when exercised\
by imperfect mortals,\
9:44\
their intended effects have\
not always been achieved.\
9:48\
Important subjects of lawmaking,\
such as some laws governing\
9:53\
family relationships, have\
been taken from the states\
9:57\
by the federal government.\
10:00\
The First Amendment\
guarantee of free speech\
10:03\
has sometimes been\
diluted by suppression\
10:07\
of unpopular speech.\
10:09\
The principle of\
separation of powers\
10:12\
has always been under\
pressure with the ebb and flow\
10:16\
of one branch of government\
exercising or inhibiting\
10:20\
the powers delegated to another.\
10:24\
There are other\
threats that undermine\
10:26\
the inspired principles of the\
United States Constitution.\
10:31\
The stature of the Constitution\
is diminished by efforts\
10:36\
to substitute current\
societal trends\
10:39\
as the reason for\
its founding, instead\
10:43\
of liberty and self-government.\
10:45\
The authority of\
the Constitution\
10:48\
is trivialized when\
candidates or officials\
10:51\
ignore its principles.\
10:54\
The dignity and force\
of the Constitution\
10:57\
is reduced by those who refer\
to it like a loyalty test\
11:02\
or a political slogan\
instead of its lofty status\
11:06\
as a source of\
authorization for and limits\
11:10\
on government authority.\
11:15\
Our belief in divine inspiration\
gives Latter-day Saints\
11:19\
a unique responsibility\
to uphold and defend\
11:23\
the United States\
Constitution and principles\
11:27\
of constitutionalism\
wherever we live.\
11:30\
We should trust in the Lord and\
be positive about this nation's\
11:35\
future.\
11:39\
What else are faithful\
Latter-day Saints to do?\
11:41\
We must pray for the\
Lord to guide and bless\
11:45\
all nations and their leaders.\
11:47\
This is part of our\
articles of faith.\
11:50\
Being subject to presidents\
or rulers of course\
11:54\
poses no obstacle to our\
opposing individual laws\
11:58\
or policies.\
12:00\
It does require that we\
exercise our influence civilly\
12:05\
and peacefully\
within the framework\
12:07\
of our constitutions\
and applicable laws.\
12:11\
On contested issues, we should\
seek to moderate and unify.\
12:20\
There are other duties that are\
part of upholding the inspired\
12:23\
Constitution.\
12:24\
We should learn and advocate\
the inspired principles\
12:29\
of the Constitution.\
12:30\
We should seek out and\
support wise and good persons\
12:35\
who will support\
those principles\
12:37\
in their public actions.\
12:38\
We should be\
knowledgeable citizens\
12:41\
who are active in making\
our influence felt\
12:44\
in civic affairs.\
12:47\
In the United States and\
in other democracies,\
12:50\
political influence is\
exercised by running\
12:54\
for office (which we\
encourage), by voting,\
12:58\
by financial support, by\
membership and service\
13:02\
in political parties, and\
by ongoing communications\
13:07\
to officials, parties,\
and candidates.\
13:10\
To function well, a\
democracy needs all of these,\
13:15\
but a conscientious\
citizen does not\
13:18\
need to provide all of them.\
13:21\
There are many political\
issues, and no party, platform,\
13:25\
or individual\
candidate can satisfy\
13:29\
all personal preferences.\
13:31\
Each citizen must\
therefore decide\
13:34\
which issues are\
most important to him\
13:37\
or her at any particular time.\
13:40\
Then, members should\
seek inspiration\
13:43\
on how to exercise their\
influence according\
13:46\
to their individual priorities.\
13:49\
This process will not be easy.\
13:52\
It may require changing party\
support or candidate choices,\
13:57\
even from election to election.\
14:00\
Such independent actions\
will sometimes require voters\
14:04\
to support candidates or\
political parties or platforms\
14:09\
whose other positions\
they cannot approve.\
14:12\
That is one reason we\
encourage our members\
14:15\
to refrain from judging one\
another in political matters.\
14:20\
We should never assert that\
a faithful Latter-day Saint\
14:25\
cannot belong to a particular\
party or vote for a particular\
14:29\
candidate.\
14:31\
We teach correct principles\
and leave our members\
14:35\
to choose how to\
prioritize and apply\
14:38\
those principles on the issues\
presented from time to time.\
14:42\
We also insist, and we ask\
our local leaders to insist,\
14:47\
that political choices\
and affiliations not\
14:51\
be the subject of\
teachings or advocacy\
14:55\
in any of our Church meetings.\
15:00\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints\
15:02\
will, of course,\
exercise its right\
15:05\
to endorse or oppose specific\
legislative proposals that we\
15:11\
believe will impact the\
free exercise of religion\
15:14\
or the essential interests\
of church organizations.\
15:19\
I testify of the divinely\
inspired Constitution\
15:23\
of the United States\
and pray that we\
15:26\
who recognize the Divine\
Being who inspired it\
15:31\
will always uphold and\
defend its great principles.\
15:35\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
