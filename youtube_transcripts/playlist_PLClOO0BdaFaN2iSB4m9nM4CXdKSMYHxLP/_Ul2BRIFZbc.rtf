a few months ago a former classmate from\
0:03\
my hometown of overton nevada\
0:06\
suggested we put together a christmas\
0:08\
gift for a beloved\
0:09\
kindergarten teacher who had recently\
0:12\
celebrated her 98th birthday\
0:15\
she taught us to be kind the importance\
0:17\
of a good nap\
0:18\
the joy of milk and graham crackers and\
0:21\
to love one another\
0:23\
thank you sister davis for being such a\
0:26\
wonderful teacher\
0:28\
i had another exceptional teacher while\
0:30\
attending rick's college many years ago\
0:32\
i was preparing to serve a mission and\
0:34\
thought it would be helpful to attend a\
0:36\
missionary preparation class\
0:38\
what i experienced changed my life\
0:41\
from the first day of class i realized i\
0:44\
was in the presence of a master teacher\
0:46\
the teacher was brother f melvin hammond\
0:49\
i knew brother hammond loved the lord\
0:52\
and he loved me i could see it in his\
0:55\
face and hear it in his voice\
0:57\
when he taught the spirit enlightened my\
1:00\
mind\
1:01\
he taught doctrine but he also invited\
1:03\
me to learn it on my own\
1:06\
that invitation helped me clearly see\
1:09\
my responsibility to learn the lord's\
1:12\
doctrine for myself\
1:14\
that experience changed me forever\
1:18\
thank you brother hammond for teaching\
1:21\
in the savior's way brothers and sisters\
1:24\
everyone deserves to have\
1:26\
this kind of learning experience both at\
1:28\
home and at church\
1:30\
the introduction to come follow me gives\
1:32\
a vision of what christ-like teaching\
1:35\
can accomplish the aim of all gospel\
1:38\
learning\
1:39\
and teaching it says is to deepen our\
1:42\
conversion to jesus christ\
1:44\
and help us become more like him the\
1:46\
kind of gospel learning that strengthens\
1:49\
our faith\
1:50\
and leads to the miracle of conversion\
1:52\
doesn't happen all at once\
1:54\
it extends beyond the classroom into an\
1:57\
individual's\
1:58\
heart and home the scriptures indicate\
2:03\
the savior's ministry in ancient america\
2:05\
was so impactful\
2:07\
and widespread that the people were all\
2:10\
converted unto the lord\
2:12\
upon all the face of the land both\
2:14\
nephites\
2:15\
and lamanites and there were no\
2:18\
contentions\
2:19\
and disputations among them and every\
2:22\
man\
2:22\
did deal justly one with another\
2:26\
how can our teaching have a similar\
2:28\
effect on those we love\
2:31\
how can we teach more like the savior\
2:33\
and help others become more deeply\
2:35\
converted\
2:36\
allow me to offer a few suggestions\
2:41\
first and foremost take it upon yourself\
2:43\
to learn all you can\
2:44\
about the master teacher himself\
2:48\
how did he show love for others what did\
2:50\
they feel when he taught\
2:53\
what did he teach what were his\
2:56\
expectations of those he taught\
2:59\
after you explore questions like these\
3:02\
evaluate and adjust\
3:04\
your way of teaching to be more like his\
3:08\
the church provides many teaching\
3:10\
resources in the gospel library app\
3:12\
and on churchofjesuschrist.org\
3:15\
one such resource is titled teaching in\
3:18\
the savior's way\
3:20\
i invite you to read and study its every\
3:22\
word\
3:24\
its principles will assist you in your\
3:26\
efforts\
3:27\
to be more christ-like in your teaching\
3:31\
my next suggestion can be illustrated\
3:33\
with an experience i had a few months\
3:35\
ago\
3:35\
when i stopped by to visit a dear friend\
3:39\
i could hear his wife in the background\
3:41\
speaking with someone\
3:42\
so i quickly excused myself so he could\
3:45\
get back to his family\
3:47\
an hour or so later i received this text\
3:49\
message\
3:50\
from his sweet wife brother newman\
3:53\
thanks for coming over\
3:55\
we should have invited you in but i want\
3:56\
to share with you what we were doing\
3:59\
since the pandemic we have been\
4:01\
discussing come follow me with our adult\
4:03\
children\
4:03\
every sunday over zoom it has literally\
4:07\
been working miracles i think it is the\
4:10\
first time our daughter has read the\
4:12\
book of mormon on her own\
4:14\
today was the last lesson on the book of\
4:16\
mormon and we were just finishing when\
4:19\
you came by\
4:20\
i thought you would be interested to\
4:22\
hear how come follow me\
4:24\
zoom and a pandemic have provided the\
4:28\
opportunity\
4:29\
at the right time to change a heart\
4:33\
it makes me wonder how many little\
4:34\
miracles have been taking place\
4:37\
during this odd time this sounds to me\
4:41\
like a fulfillment of the prom\
4:43\
promise president russell m nelson made\
4:46\
in october 2018.\
4:50\
he said that home-centered\
4:52\
church-supported gospel learning\
4:54\
has the potential to unleash the power\
4:56\
of families\
4:57\
as each family follows through\
4:59\
conscientiously\
5:01\
and carefully to transform their home\
5:04\
into a sanctuary of faith i promise\
5:08\
that as you diligently work to remodel\
5:10\
your home\
5:11\
into a center of gospel learning over\
5:14\
time\
5:15\
your sabbath days will truly be a\
5:18\
delight\
5:19\
your children will be excited to learn\
5:21\
and to live the savior's teachings\
5:24\
changes in your family will be dramatic\
5:28\
and sustaining what a beautiful promise\
5:33\
to be truly life-changing conversion to\
5:36\
jesus christ must involve our whole soul\
5:38\
and permeate every aspect of our lives\
5:42\
this is why it must be focused at the\
5:44\
center of our lives\
5:46\
our families and homes my final\
5:50\
final suggestion is to remember that\
5:52\
conversion must come from within\
5:54\
as illustrated in the parable of the ten\
5:56\
virgins\
5:58\
we cannot give someone else the oil of\
6:00\
our conversion\
6:01\
as much as we might want to as elder\
6:04\
david a bednar taught\
6:06\
this precious oil is acquired one drop\
6:08\
at a time\
6:09\
patiently and persistently no shortcut\
6:13\
is available\
6:14\
no last minute flurry of preparation\
6:17\
is come follow me as based on that truth\
6:22\
i compare to the angel who helped nephi\
6:24\
learn about jesus christ by saying\
6:26\
look like that angel come follow me\
6:30\
invites\
6:31\
us to look in the scriptures and the\
6:33\
words of the modern day prophets\
6:35\
in order to find the savior and hear him\
6:39\
like nephi we will be personally tutored\
6:42\
by the spirit\
6:44\
while reading and pondering the word of\
6:47\
god\
6:48\
come follow me is the springboard\
6:51\
that helps each of us to dive deeply\
6:54\
into the living waters\
6:56\
of the doctrine of christ a spirit's\
6:59\
response a parent's responsibility is\
7:01\
similar\
7:02\
in many ways children inherit many\
7:04\
things from their parents\
7:06\
but a testimony is not one of them\
7:09\
we can't give our children a testimony\
7:11\
any more\
7:12\
than we can make a seed grow but we can\
7:15\
provide\
7:16\
a nourishing environment with good soil\
7:18\
free of thorns that would choke the word\
7:21\
we can strive to create the ideal\
7:22\
conditions so that our children and\
7:24\
others we love\
7:25\
can find place for the seed hear the\
7:28\
word and understand it\
7:29\
and discover for themselves that the\
7:32\
seed is good\
7:34\
several years ago my son jack and i had\
7:36\
the opportunity to play the old course\
7:38\
at st\
7:38\
andrews in scotland where the game of\
7:40\
golf began\
7:42\
it was simply amazing upon my return i\
7:45\
tried to convey to others the magnitude\
7:47\
of the experience\
7:49\
but i couldn't photos videos and my best\
7:52\
descriptions were totally inadequate\
7:54\
i finally realized the only way for\
7:56\
someone to know the grandeur of saint\
7:58\
andrews\
7:59\
is to experience it to see the vast\
8:01\
fairways\
8:02\
breathe the air feel the wind in their\
8:04\
face and\
8:06\
hit a few errant shots into the\
8:08\
cavernous bunkers\
8:09\
and burly gorse bushes which we did with\
8:12\
great efficiency\
8:15\
so it is with the word of god we can\
8:17\
teach it\
8:18\
we can preach it we can explain it we\
8:20\
can talk about it we can describe it we\
8:23\
can even testify of it\
8:25\
but until a person feels the sacred word\
8:28\
of god distill upon his or her soul\
8:32\
like the deuce from heaven through the\
8:34\
power of the spirit\
8:36\
it will be like looking at a postcard or\
8:38\
someone else's\
8:39\
vacation photos you have to go there\
8:42\
yourself\
8:43\
conversion is a personal journey\
8:46\
a journey of gathering\
8:50\
everyone who teaches in the home and at\
8:51\
church can offer to others the\
8:53\
opportunity to have their own spiritual\
8:55\
experience\
8:56\
through these experiences they will come\
8:58\
to know the truth of all things for\
9:00\
themselves\
9:01\
president nelson taught if you have\
9:04\
sincere questions about the gospel or\
9:06\
the church\
9:07\
as you choose to let god prevail you\
9:10\
will be led to find and understand\
9:12\
the absolute eternal truths that will\
9:15\
guide your life\
9:16\
and help you stay firmly on the covenant\
9:19\
path\
9:21\
i invite leaders and teachers in every\
9:23\
organization of the church\
9:25\
to counsel together with parents and\
9:28\
youth\
9:29\
in order to dramatically improve\
9:30\
teaching at every level\
9:33\
in stakes in wards and in homes\
9:37\
this will be achieved by teaching the\
9:39\
doctrine and inviting spirit-filled\
9:41\
discussion\
9:42\
about the truth truths the holy ghost\
9:46\
has taught us in the quiet moments of\
9:48\
our personal\
9:49\
study my dear friends in christ\
9:54\
the responsibility rests squarely upon\
9:56\
each of us\
9:57\
to follow the example of the master\
10:00\
teacher\
10:01\
and teach like him his way\
10:05\
is the true way as we follow him\
10:09\
when he shall appear we shall be like\
10:12\
him\
10:13\
for we shall see him as he is\
10:17\
that we may have this hope that we may\
10:20\
be purified\
10:22\
even as he is pure\
10:25\
in the name of he who is risen the\
10:28\
master teacher himself\
10:31\
jesus christ amen\
