Prior to that first\
Easter, as Jesus\
0:05\
concluded the new\
sacramental ordinance that He\
0:08\
had administered\
to the Twelve, He\
0:12\
began His majestic farewell\
discourse and moved toward\
0:17\
Gethsemane, betrayal,\
and crucifixion.\
0:20\
However, sensing the concern\
and perhaps even outright\
0:26\
fear some of those men must have\
exhibited, He said this to them\
0:32\
(and to us):\
0:35\
"Let not your heart be\
troubled: ye believe in God,\
0:40\
believe also in me. ...\
0:43\
I will not leave\
you comfortless:\
0:46\
I will come to you.\
0:49\
...\
0:50\
Peace I leave with you,\
my peace I give unto you:\
0:55\
not as the world\
giveth, give I unto you.\
1:01\
Let not your heart be troubled,\
neither let it be afraid."\
1:09\
Challenging times come to\
those in this mortal world,\
1:13\
including to the\
faithful, but the\
1:16\
reassuring message of\
Christ is that although He,\
1:20\
the paschal lamb, would go\
like "a sheep before [its]\
1:25\
shearers," He would\
nevertheless rise,\
1:28\
as the psalmist said, to be\
"our refuge and strength, [our]\
1:34\
very present help in\
[times of] trouble."\
1:39\
Realizing what difficult\
hours lay ahead\
1:41\
for Christ as He moved\
toward the cross and for His\
1:46\
disciples as they\
would take His gospel\
1:49\
to the world in the\
meridian of time,\
1:53\
go with me now to\
a related message\
1:56\
for members of the Savior's\
Church in the latter days.\
2:01\
It lies in the staggering number\
of verses in the Book of Mormon\
2:06\
devoted to conflict of one\
kind or another, from Laman\
2:12\
and Lemuel's eternally annoying\
behavior up to final battles\
2:17\
involving hundreds of\
thousands of soldiers.\
2:23\
One of the obvious\
reasons for this emphasis\
2:25\
is that inasmuch as\
the Book of Mormon was\
2:28\
written for a\
latter-day audience,\
2:31\
these authors--who\
experienced so much of war\
2:34\
themselves--prophetically warn\
us that violence and conflict\
2:39\
will be a signature\
characteristic of relationships\
2:43\
in the last days.\
2:46\
Of course, my theory about\
latter-day contention\
2:50\
isn't very original.\
2:51\
Two thousand years\
ago, the Savior\
2:54\
warned that in the\
last days there\
2:57\
would be "wars and\
rumors of wars,"\
3:00\
later saying that "peace [would]\
be taken from the earth."\
3:04\
Surely this Prince of Peace,\
who taught emphatically that\
3:10\
contention is of the devil,\
surely he must weep along with\
3:16\
His divine Father over those in\
the human family in our day who\
3:23\
are "without affection," the\
scripture says, and who cannot\
3:28\
figure out how to\
live together in love.\
3:33\
Brothers and sisters, we do\
see too much conflict, anger,\
3:39\
and general\
incivility around us.\
3:43\
Fortunately, the\
current generation\
3:46\
has not had a Third World War to\
fight, nor have we experienced\
3:51\
a global economic crash\
like the one in 1929\
3:55\
leading to a Great Depression.\
3:57\
We are, however, facing\
a kind of Third World\
4:02\
War that is not a fight\
to crush our enemies but a\
4:07\
conscription marshaling\
the children of God\
4:11\
to care more about each other\
and to help heal the wounds we\
4:17\
find in a conflicted world.\
4:20\
The Great Depression\
we now face has\
4:24\
less to do with the\
external loss of our savings\
4:27\
and more to do with the internal\
loss of our self-confidence,\
4:32\
with real deficits of faith and\
hope and charity all around us.\
4:40\
But the instruments we need\
to create a brighter day\
4:45\
and grow an economy\
of genuine goodness\
4:49\
are abundantly provided for\
in the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
4:55\
We cannot afford--and this\
world cannot afford--our failure\
5:02\
to put these gospel concepts\
and fortifying covenants to full\
5:09\
use, personally and publicly.\
5:13\
So, in a world "tossed with\
tempest, and not comforted,"\
5:19\
as Jehovah said it\
would be, how do\
5:22\
we find what He called\
the "covenant of peace"?\
5:27\
We find it by\
turning to Him, who\
5:32\
said He would have\
mercy on us and,\
5:38\
"with everlasting kindness,"\
grant peace to our children.\
5:44\
In spite of frightful prophecies\
and unsettling scriptures\
5:49\
declaring that peace would be\
taken from the earth generally,\
5:53\
the prophets, including our\
own beloved Russell M. Nelson,\
5:59\
have taught that it\
does not have to be\
6:03\
taken from us individually!\
6:07\
So this Easter,\
let's try to practice\
6:11\
peace in a personal way,\
applying the grace and healing\
6:17\
balm of the Atonement\
of the Lord Jesus Christ\
6:22\
to ourselves, and our\
families, and all those we\
6:27\
can reach around us.\
6:31\
Fortunately, even astonishingly,\
this soothing salve\
6:36\
is made available to us "without\
money and without price."\
6:44\
Such help and hope is dearly\
needed because in this\
6:50\
worldwide congregation today\
are many who struggle with any\
6:55\
number of challenges--physical\
or emotional,\
6:59\
social or financial, or a\
dozen other kinds of trouble.\
7:04\
But many of these we are not\
strong enough to address in and\
7:09\
of ourselves, for the help and\
peace we need is not the kind\
7:16\
"the world giveth."\
7:19\
No, for the truly\
difficult problems\
7:23\
we need what the scriptures\
call "the powers of heaven";\
7:27\
and to access these\
7:30\
powers we must live by what\
those same scriptures call\
7:35\
"principles of righteousness."\
7:38\
Now understanding that\
connection between principle\
7:43\
and power is the one lesson the\
7:47\
human family never\
seems able to learn,\
7:52\
so says the God of\
heaven and earth!\
7:58\
And what are those principles?\
8:00\
Well, they're listed\
repeatedly in scripture.\
8:04\
They're taught again\
and again and again\
8:08\
in conferences like this.\
8:12\
And in our dispensation,\
the Prophet Joseph Smith\
8:15\
was taught them in\
response to his own version\
8:19\
of the cry "My God, my God,\
why hast thou forsaken me?"\
8:26\
In the cold, uncaring\
confinement of Liberty Jail,\
8:30\
he was taught that the\
8:33\
principles of righteousness\
included such virtues\
8:38\
as patience, "long-suffering,\
... gentleness, ... and ...\
8:44\
love unfeigned."\
8:45\
Absent those principles, it\
was certain we would eventually\
8:51\
face\
8:52\
discord and enmity.\
8:57\
In that regard, may\
I speak for a moment\
8:59\
about the absence in some\
quarters of these principles\
9:05\
of righteousness in our time?\
9:07\
As a rule, I am an upbeat,\
cheerful kind of fellow.\
9:12\
And there is so much that\
is so good and so beautiful\
9:17\
in our world.\
9:18\
Certainly, we have\
more material blessings\
9:21\
than any generation\
in all of history.\
9:26\
But in twenty-first-century\
culture generally and too often\
9:31\
in the Church, we\
still see lives\
9:35\
that are in trouble,\
with compromises\
9:39\
resulting in too many broken\
covenants and too many broken\
9:44\
hearts.\
9:47\
Consider the coarse\
language that\
9:51\
parallels sexual\
transgression, both of which\
9:55\
are so omnipresent in\
movies or on television.\
10:00\
Or note the sexual\
harassment and other forms\
10:05\
of impropriety we read so\
much about in the workplace.\
10:09\
In matters of covenantal\
purity, the sacred is too often\
10:15\
being made common and\
the holy is too often\
10:21\
being made profane.\
10:24\
To any who are tempted to walk\
or talk or behave in these\
10:30\
says, "as the world\
giveth," so to speak,\
10:33\
don't expect it to lead\
to peaceful experience;\
10:38\
I promise you, in the name\
of the Lord, it won't.\
10:43\
"Wickedness never\
was happiness,"\
10:48\
an ancient prophet once said.\
10:51\
When the dance is over, the\
piper must always be paid,\
10:57\
and most often it is in a\
currency of tears and regret.\
11:06\
Or perhaps we see other\
forms of abuse or indignity.\
11:10\
How doubly careful we have to be\
as disciples of the Lord Jesus\
11:16\
Christ not to fall victim\
to any such behavior.\
11:21\
In no case are we to be\
guilty of any form of abuse\
11:27\
or unrighteous dominion or\
immoral coercion--not physical\
11:32\
or emotional or ecclesiastical\
or any other kind.\
11:37\
I remember feeling the fervor\
of President Gordon B. Hinckley\
11:41\
a few years ago when he spoke\
to the men of the Church\
11:45\
regarding those he called\
"tyrants in their own homes":\
11:50\
"How tragic and\
utterly disgusting\
11:54\
a phenomenon is wife\
abuse," he said.\
11:57\
"Any man in this Church who\
12:00\
abuses his wife, who demeans\
her, who insults her,\
12:05\
who exercises unrighteous\
dominion over her\
12:08\
is unworthy to hold\
the priesthood.\
12:12\
...\
12:12\
[He] is unworthy to hold\
a temple recommend."\
12:18\
Equally despicable, he said,\
was any form of child abuse.\
12:23\
or any other abuse.\
12:26\
In too many instances,\
otherwise faithful men, women,\
12:31\
and even children can be\
guilty of speaking unkindly,\
12:37\
even destructively, to\
those to whom they may well\
12:42\
be sealed by a holy ordinance\
in the temple of the Lord.\
12:49\
Everyone has the right to\
be loved, to feel peaceful,\
12:56\
and to find safety at home.\
13:00\
Please, may we try to maintain\
that environment there.\
13:09\
The promise of\
being a peacemaker\
13:13\
is that you will have\
the Holy Ghost for your\
13:16\
constant companion, and\
blessings will flow to you\
13:21\
"without compulsory\
means ... forever."\
13:26\
No one can employ a sharp\
tongue or unkind words\
13:32\
and still sing on tune "the\
song of redeeming love."\
13:42\
May I close where I began.\
13:47\
Tomorrow is Easter, a time for\
the righteous principles of the\
14:00\
gospel of Jesus Christ and\
His Atonement to "pass over,"\
14:07\
pass over conflict\
and contention,\
14:11\
pass over despair\
and transgression,\
14:14\
and pass over\
ultimately over death.\
14:17\
It's a time to pledge total\
loyalty in word and deed\
14:21\
to the Lamb of God,\
who "[bore] our griefs,\
14:24\
and carried our sorrows" in\
His determination to finish\
14:28\
the work of salvation\
in our behalf.\
14:32\
In spite of betrayal and pain,\
mistreatment and cruelty,\
14:38\
and bearing all the\
accumulated sins and sorrows\
14:42\
of the human family, the\
Son of the Living God\
14:46\
looked down the long path of\
mortality, saw us this weekend,\
14:53\
and said: "Peace I leave with\
you, my peace I give unto you:\
15:02\
not as the world\
giveth, give I unto you.\
15:06\
Let not your heart be troubled,\
neither let it be afraid."\
15:13\
Have a blessed, joyful,\
peaceful Easter.\
15:18\
Its untold possibilities have\
already been paid for by the\
15:25\
Prince of Peace, whom I\
love with all my heart,\
15:29\
whose Church this\
is, and of whom I\
15:33\
bear unequivocal witness, even\
the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
