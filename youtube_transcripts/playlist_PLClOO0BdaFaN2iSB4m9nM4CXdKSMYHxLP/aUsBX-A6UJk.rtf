I am grateful to be with you\
this wonderful Easter morning.\
0:04\
When I think of Easter, I\
love to rehearse in my mind\
0:07\
the words spoken\
by angels to those\
0:10\
who were at the garden\
tomb: "Why seek ye\
0:13\
the living among the dead?\
0:14\
He is not here, but is risen."\
0:17\
I testify that Jesus of Nazareth\
was resurrected and He lives.\
0:24\
Thirty-four years ago, my\
missionary companion and I\
0:26\
met and taught a\
very intellectual man\
0:29\
who was a contributing writer\
in a local newspaper in Davao\
0:32\
City, Philippines.\
0:34\
We enjoyed teaching him because\
he had a lot of questions\
0:37\
and was very respectful\
of our beliefs.\
0:40\
The most memorable\
question he asked us\
0:43\
was "What think ye of Christ?"\
0:45\
We of course excitedly\
shared our feelings\
0:48\
and bore testimony\
of Jesus Christ.\
0:51\
He later published an\
article on the same topic\
0:53\
that contained wonderful words\
and phrases about the Savior.\
0:57\
I remember being impressed\
but not necessarily lifted.\
1:01\
It had good information\
but felt hollow\
1:04\
and lacked spiritual power.\
1:07\
"What think ye of Christ?"\
1:08\
I am realizing that\
how intimately I\
1:11\
know the Savior significantly\
influences my ability\
1:14\
to hear Him as well\
as how I respond.\
1:18\
A few years ago,\
Elder David A. Bednar\
1:20\
asked the following questions\
as part of his remarks:\
1:23\
"Do we only know\
about the Savior,\
1:26\
or are we increasingly\
coming to know Him?\
1:29\
How do we come to\
know the Lord?"\
1:33\
As I studied and pondered, I\
came to the stark realization\
1:37\
that what I know about\
the Savior greatly\
1:39\
outweighed how much\
I really know Him.\
1:42\
I resolved then to put forth\
more effort to know Him.\
1:45\
I am very grateful for the\
scriptures and testimonies\
1:49\
of faithful men and women\
disciples of Jesus Christ.\
1:53\
My own journey over\
the last few years\
1:55\
has taken me down many roads\
of study and discovery.\
1:58\
I pray that the Holy Ghost\
will convey to you today\
2:01\
a message far greater\
than the inadequate words\
2:05\
that I have written.\
2:07\
First, we need to recognize\
that knowing the Savior\
2:09\
is the most important\
pursuit of our lives.\
2:12\
It should take priority\
over anything else.\
2:15\
"And this is life\
eternal, that they\
2:18\
might know thee the only\
true God, and Jesus Christ,\
2:21\
whom thou hast sent."\
2:23\
"Jesus saith unto him, I am the\
way, the truth, and the life:\
2:27\
no man cometh unto the\
Father, but by me."\
2:30\
"I am the light of\
the world: he that\
2:32\
followeth me shall\
not walk in darkness,\
2:35\
but shall have the\
light of life."\
2:39\
Second, as we are increasingly\
coming to know the Savior,\
2:42\
scriptural passages and\
the words of the prophets\
2:46\
become so intimately\
meaningful to us\
2:49\
that they become our own words.\
2:51\
It is not about copying\
the words and feelings\
2:54\
and experiences of\
others as much as it\
2:57\
is coming to know for ourselves,\
in our own unique way,\
3:01\
by experimenting upon the\
word and receiving a witness\
3:05\
from the Holy Ghost.\
3:08\
AS THE PROPHET ALMA\
DECLARED: "Do ye not\
3:10\
suppose that I know of\
these things myself?\
3:13\
Behold, I testify\
unto you that I\
3:15\
do know that these things\
whereof I have spoken are true.\
3:18\
And how do ye suppose that\
I know of their surety?"\
3:21\
"Behold, I say unto you\
they are made known unto me\
3:24\
by the Holy Spirit of God.\
3:25\
Behold, I have fasted\
and prayed many days\
3:28\
that I might know\
these things of myself.\
3:31\
And now I do know of myself\
that they are true; for the Lord\
3:35\
God hath made them manifest\
unto me by his Holy Spirit;\
3:39\
and this is the spirit of\
revelation which is in me."\
3:43\
Third, an increasing\
understanding\
3:45\
that the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ\
3:47\
applies to us personally\
and individually\
3:50\
will help us know Him.\
3:52\
Oftentimes it is easier\
for us to think and speak\
3:55\
of Christ's Atonement\
in general terms\
3:58\
than to recognize its personal\
significance in our lives.\
4:02\
The Atonement of Jesus Christ\
is infinite and eternal and\
4:06\
all-encompassing in\
its breadth and depth\
4:09\
but wholly personal and\
individual in its effects.\
4:13\
Because of His\
atoning sacrifice,\
4:15\
the Savior has power to\
cleanse, heal, and strengthen us\
4:20\
one by one.\
4:22\
The Savior's only\
desire, His only purpose\
4:24\
from the very beginning was\
to do the will of the Father.\
4:28\
The will of the Father was for\
Him to assist in "[bringing]\
4:32\
to pass the immortality\
and eternal life of man"\
4:35\
by becoming our "advocate\
with the Father."\
4:38\
Hence, "though he\
were a Son, yet\
4:41\
learned he obedience by the\
things which he suffered;\
4:44\
And being made\
perfect, he became\
4:46\
the author of eternal salvation\
unto all them that obey him."\
4:52\
"And he shall go forth,\
suffering pains and afflictions\
4:55\
and temptations of every kind.\
4:56\
...\
4:57\
And he will take upon him death,\
that he may loose the bands\
5:00\
of death ... and he will take\
upon him their infirmities,\
5:03\
that his bowels may\
be filled with mercy,\
5:06\
that he may know according to\
the flesh how to succor his\
5:09\
people according to\
their infirmities. ...\
5:12\
The Son of God\
suffereth according\
5:14\
to the flesh that he\
might take upon him\
5:17\
the sins of his people,\
that he might blot out\
5:20\
their transgressions\
according to the power\
5:23\
of his deliverance."\
5:26\
I would like to share a simple\
experience that illustrates\
5:28\
the struggle we sometimes have\
to embrace the personal nature\
5:32\
of the Lord's Atonement.\
5:34\
Years ago, at the invitation\
of my file leader,\
5:36\
I read the Book of Mormon\
from cover to cover\
5:39\
and marked the verses\
that referenced\
5:41\
the Lord's Atonement.\
5:42\
He also invited me to\
prepare a one-page summary\
5:45\
of what I learned.\
5:46\
I said to myself, "One page?\
5:48\
Sure, that is easy."\
5:50\
To my surprise however,\
I found the task\
5:53\
to be extremely\
difficult, and I failed.\
5:56\
I have since realized\
that I failed\
5:58\
because I missed the mark and\
had incorrect assumptions.\
6:01\
First, I expected the summary\
to be inspiring to everyone.\
6:05\
The summary was meant for\
me and not for anyone else.\
6:08\
It was meant to capture\
my feelings and emotions\
6:11\
about the Savior and\
what He has done for me\
6:13\
so that every time\
I read it, it will\
6:16\
bring to the surface\
wonderful, poignant,\
6:18\
and personal\
spiritual experiences.\
6:21\
Second, I expected the summary\
to be grand and elaborate\
6:23\
and contain big\
words and phrases.\
6:26\
It was never about big words.\
6:27\
It was meant to be a clear\
and simple declaration\
6:30\
of conviction.\
6:31\
"For my soul delighteth\
in plainness:\
6:34\
for after this manner\
doth the Lord God\
6:36\
work among the children of men.\
6:38\
For the Lord God giveth light\
unto the understanding."\
6:42\
Third, I expected\
it to be perfect.\
6:44\
A summary to end all summaries.\
6:46\
A final summary that one cannot\
and should not add to instead\
6:50\
of a work in progress that I\
can add a word here or a phrase\
6:53\
there as my understanding\
of Jesus Christ's Atonement\
6:57\
increases.\
6:58\
As a young man, I learned a lot\
from my conversations with my\
7:01\
bishop.\
7:02\
During those tender\
years, I learned\
7:04\
to love these words\
from a favorite hymn:\
7:07\
"I stand all amazed at\
the love Jesus offers me,\
7:10\
confused at the grace that\
so fully he proffers me.\
7:14\
I tremble to know\
that for me he was\
7:17\
crucified, that for me,\
a sinner, he suffered,\
7:21\
he bled and died.\
7:22\
Oh, it is wonderful\
that he should care\
7:24\
for me enough to die for me!\
7:26\
Oh, it is wonderful,\
wonderful to me!"\
7:30\
The prophet Moroni\
invited us to:\
7:32\
"And now, I would commend you\
to seek this Jesus of whom the\
7:36\
[prophets and apostles]\
have written."\
7:39\
President Russell M. Nelson\
promised that "if [we] proceed\
7:44\
to learn all [we] can\
about Jesus Christ, ...\
7:46\
[our] ability to turn away\
from sin will increase.\
7:49\
[Our] desire to keep the\
commandments will soar."\
7:53\
On this Easter Sunday, just\
as the Savior came forth\
7:56\
from His stone\
grave, may we awake\
7:59\
from our spiritual slumber and\
rise above the clouds of doubt,\
8:03\
the clutches of fear,\
the intoxicating pride,\
8:07\
and the lull of complacency.\
8:09\
Jesus Christ and\
Heavenly Father live.\
8:12\
I testify of their\
perfect love for us.\
8:16\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
