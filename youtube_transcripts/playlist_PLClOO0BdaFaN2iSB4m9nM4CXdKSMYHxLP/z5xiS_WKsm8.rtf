On this glorious Easter Sunday,\
our children joyfully sing,\
0:05\
"On a golden\
springtime, Jesus Christ\
0:08\
awoke and left the tomb where\
he had lain; the bands of death\
0:12\
he broke."\
0:14\
We are grateful for our\
knowledge of the Resurrection\
0:17\
of Jesus Christ.\
0:18\
And yet, at some\
point in our lives,\
0:21\
we will have felt\
heartbroken after losing\
0:24\
someone whom we love dearly.\
0:27\
Through the current\
global pandemic,\
0:30\
many of us have lost loved\
ones--either family members\
0:34\
or friends.\
0:36\
We pray for those who\
are grieving such loss.\
0:41\
President Russell M. Nelson\
has said: "Irrespective of age,\
0:46\
we mourn for those\
loved and lost.\
0:50\
Mourning is one of the deepest\
expressions of pure love. ...\
0:54\
Moreover, we can't fully\
appreciate joyful reunions\
1:00\
later without tearful\
separations now.\
1:04\
The only way to take\
sorrow out of death\
1:08\
is to take love out of life."\
1:13\
We can imagine how\
Jesus's friends, who\
1:16\
had followed Him and\
ministered to Him,\
1:19\
felt upon witnessing His death.\
1:21\
We know that they\
"mourned and wept."\
1:25\
On the day of the\
Crucifixion, not\
1:28\
knowing what would\
happen on Sunday,\
1:30\
they must have been overwhelmed\
by distress, wondering how they\
1:35\
would go on without their Lord.\
1:38\
Nevertheless, they\
continued ministering\
1:42\
to Him even in death.\
1:45\
Joseph of Arimathea\
begged Pilate\
1:48\
to give him Jesus's body.\
1:50\
He took the body down,\
wrapped it in fine linen,\
1:55\
laid it in his own new tomb,\
and rolled a great stone\
2:00\
to the door of the sepulchre.\
2:02\
Nicodemus brought\
myrrh and aloes.\
2:05\
He helped Joseph take\
the body and wrap it\
2:09\
in linen with the spices.\
2:12\
Mary Magdalene and other women\
followed Joseph and Nicodemus,\
2:17\
watched where they laid Jesus's\
body, and prepared sweet spices\
2:23\
and ointments to anoint it.\
2:25\
According to the strict\
laws of that day,\
2:29\
they waited to further\
prepare and anoint\
2:32\
the body because\
Saturday was the Sabbath.\
2:36\
Then, early in the\
morning on Sunday,\
2:40\
they went to the sepulchre.\
2:42\
After realizing that the body\
of the Savior was not there,\
2:46\
they went to tell the disciples,\
who were Jesus's Apostles.\
2:52\
The Apostles came\
with them to the tomb\
2:55\
and saw that it was empty.\
2:57\
All but Mary\
Magdalene eventually\
3:00\
left, wondering what had\
happened to the Savior's body.\
3:06\
Mary Magdalene stayed\
at the tomb by herself.\
3:09\
Only a few days before, she\
had seen the tragic death\
3:14\
of her friend and Master.\
3:16\
Now His tomb was empty, and\
she did not know where He was.\
3:22\
It was too much for her\
to take in, and she wept.\
3:26\
At that moment, the\
resurrected Savior came to her\
3:32\
and asked why she was weeping\
and whom she was seeking.\
3:37\
Thinking that the\
gardener spoke to her,\
3:40\
she asked that, if he had\
taken her Lord's body,\
3:45\
to tell her where it\
was so she could get it.\
3:49\
I imagine that the\
Lord may have allowed\
3:52\
Mary Magdalene to grieve\
and to express her pain.\
3:56\
He then called her by her\
name, and she turned to Him\
4:00\
and recognized Him.\
4:03\
She saw the resurrected\
Christ and was a witness\
4:07\
of His glorious Resurrection.\
4:11\
Like you, in some\
way I can relate\
4:14\
to the anguish felt by Mary\
Magdalene and her friends\
4:17\
as they grieved the\
death of their Lord.\
4:21\
When I was nine years old,\
I lost my older brother\
4:26\
during a devastating earthquake.\
4:28\
Because it happened\
unexpectedly,\
4:31\
it took me a while to grasp the\
reality of what had occurred.\
4:36\
I was heartbroken by sorrow,\
and I would ask myself:\
4:41\
"What happened to my brother?\
4:43\
Where is he?\
4:44\
Where did he go?\
4:46\
Will I ever see him again?"\
4:49\
Back then, I did not yet know\
about God's plan of salvation,\
4:54\
and I had the desire to\
know where we come from,\
4:59\
what the purpose of\
life is, and what\
5:02\
happens to us after we die.\
5:05\
Don't we all have\
those yearnings\
5:08\
when we lose a loved one or\
when we go through difficulties\
5:12\
in our lives?\
5:14\
A few years after, I started\
thinking of my brother\
5:17\
in a specific way.\
5:19\
I would imagine him\
knocking on our door.\
5:22\
I would open the door, he\
would be standing there,\
5:26\
and he would tell me: "I\
am not dead; I am alive.\
5:31\
I could not come to you,\
but now I will stay with you\
5:35\
and never leave again."\
5:38\
That imagining, almost a dream,\
helped me cope with the pain\
5:44\
that I felt over losing him.\
5:46\
The thought that he would\
be with me came to my mind\
5:50\
over and over.\
5:52\
Sometimes I would even\
stare at the door,\
5:55\
hoping that he would knock\
and I would see him again.\
6:01\
About 40 years later,\
during Easter time,\
6:05\
I was pondering about the\
Resurrection of Jesus Christ\
6:09\
and started thinking\
about my brother.\
6:11\
At that moment, something\
clicked in my mind.\
6:15\
I remembered imagining\
him coming to see me.\
6:19\
That day, I realized that\
the Spirit had given me\
6:23\
comfort in a difficult time.\
6:26\
I had received a witness that\
my brother's spirit is not dead;\
6:31\
he is alive.\
6:33\
He is still progressing\
in his eternal existence.\
6:37\
I now know that "[my]\
brother shall rise again"\
6:41\
at that magnificent moment\
when, because of Jesus\
6:46\
Christ's Resurrection, we\
will all be resurrected.\
6:51\
In addition, He has made\
it possible for all of us\
6:55\
to be reunited as families\
and have eternal joy\
7:00\
in the presence of God if we\
will choose to make and keep\
7:05\
sacred covenants with Him.\
7:09\
PRESIDENT NELSON HAS TAUGHT:\
"Death is a necessary component\
7:13\
of our eternal existence.\
7:15\
No one knows when\
it will come, but it\
7:18\
is essential to God's\
great plan of happiness.\
7:21\
Thanks to the\
Atonement of the Lord,\
7:24\
eventual Resurrection\
is a reality\
7:26\
and eternal life is a\
possibility for all humankind.\
7:30\
...\
7:31\
For sorrowing loved\
ones left behind ...\
7:34\
the sting of death is soothed\
by a steadfast faith in Christ,\
7:39\
a perfect brightness of hope,\
a love of God and of all men,\
7:43\
and a deep desire to serve them.\
7:46\
That faith, that hope, that\
love will qualify us to come\
7:51\
into God's holy presence ...\
with our eternal companions\
7:55\
and families, dwell\
with Him forever."\
7:59\
I testify that "if Christ\
had not risen from the dead,\
8:03\
or have broken\
the bands of death\
8:05\
that the grave should\
have no victory,\
8:07\
and that death\
should have no sting,\
8:09\
there could have\
been no resurrection.\
8:12\
But there is a resurrection,\
therefore the grave\
8:15\
hath no victory, and\
the sting of death\
8:19\
is swallowed up in Christ.\
8:21\
He is the light and the life\
of the world; yea, a light that\
8:26\
is endless, that can\
never be darkened; yea,\
8:30\
and also a life which\
is endless, that there\
8:33\
can be no more death."\
8:37\
JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF DECLARED:\
"I am the resurrection,\
8:39\
and the life: he that believeth\
in me, though he were dead,\
8:43\
yet shall he live."\
8:45\
I testify that through\
the redeeming Atonement\
8:48\
and glorious Resurrection\
of Jesus Christ,\
8:51\
broken hearts can be healed,\
anguish can become peace,\
8:55\
and distress can become hope.\
8:57\
He can embrace us in\
His arms of mercy,\
9:00\
comforting, empowering,\
and healing each of us.\
9:03\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
