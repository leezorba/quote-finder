My dear brothers\
and sisters, I am\
0:03\
grateful for the privilege\
of speaking with you on this\
0:06\
Easter Sunday.\
0:08\
The atoning sacrifice and\
Resurrection of Jesus Christ\
0:13\
changed each of\
our lives forever.\
0:17\
We love Him and gratefully\
worship Him and our Heavenly\
0:22\
Father.\
0:25\
During the past\
six months, we have\
0:27\
continued to grapple\
with a global pandemic.\
0:31\
I marvel at your resilience\
and spiritual strength\
0:36\
in the face of illness,\
loss, and isolation.\
0:41\
I pray constantly\
that through it all,\
0:45\
you will feel the Lord's\
unfailing love for you.\
0:51\
If you have responded\
to your trials\
0:54\
with a stronger\
discipleship, this past year\
0:58\
will not have been in vain.\
1:02\
This morning we have heard\
from Church leaders who\
1:05\
come from every\
populated continent on\
1:08\
earth.\
1:09\
Truly, the blessings\
of the gospel\
1:12\
are for every race,\
language, and people.\
1:17\
The Church of Jesus\
Christ is a global Church.\
1:22\
Jesus Christ is our leader.\
1:29\
Thankfully, even\
a pandemic has not\
1:31\
been able to slow the\
onward march of His truth.\
1:36\
The gospel of Jesus\
Christ is exactly what\
1:39\
is needed in this confused,\
contentious, and weary world.\
1:47\
Each of God's children\
deserves the opportunity\
1:51\
to hear and accept the\
healing and redeeming\
1:53\
message of Jesus Christ.\
1:56\
No other message is more\
vital to our happiness--now\
2:02\
and forever.\
2:05\
No other message is\
more filled with hope.\
2:09\
No other message can eliminate\
contention in our society.\
2:17\
Faith in Jesus Christ is\
the foundation of all belief\
2:22\
and the conduit of divine power.\
2:29\
According to the Apostle\
Paul, "Without faith it\
2:33\
is impossible to please [God]:\
for he that cometh to God\
2:38\
must believe that he is, and\
that he is a rewarder of them\
2:44\
that diligently seek him."\
2:49\
Everything good in life--every\
potential blessing of eternal\
2:54\
significance--begins with faith.\
2:58\
Allowing God to\
prevail in our lives\
3:01\
begins with faith that He\
is willing to guide us.\
3:07\
True repentance\
begins with faith\
3:10\
that Jesus Christ has the\
power to cleanse, heal,\
3:16\
and strengthen us.\
3:19\
"Deny not the power of God,"\
the prophet Moroni declared,\
3:24\
"for he worketh by power,\
according to the faith\
3:28\
of the children of men."\
3:32\
It is our faith that unlocks\
the power of God in our lives.\
3:40\
And yet, exercising faith\
can seem overwhelming.\
3:46\
At times we may wonder\
if we can possibly\
3:49\
muster enough faith to\
receive the blessings that we\
3:51\
so desperately need.\
3:56\
However, the Lord\
put those fears\
3:58\
to rest through the words of\
the Book of Mormon prophet Alma.\
4:04\
Alma asks us simply to\
experiment upon the word\
4:10\
and "exercise a\
particle of faith, yea,\
4:14\
even if [we] can no more\
than desire to believe."\
4:18\
The phrase "particle\
of faith" reminds me\
4:23\
of the Lord's biblical\
promise that if we "have faith\
4:28\
as a grain of mustard\
seed," we shall\
4:33\
be able to "say\
unto this mountain,\
4:37\
Remove hence to yonder\
place; and it shall remove;\
4:40\
and nothing shall be\
impossible unto you."\
4:45\
The Lord understands\
our mortal weakness.\
4:48\
We all falter at times.\
4:51\
But He also knows\
our great potential.\
4:55\
The mustard seed starts\
small but grows into a tree\
4:59\
large enough for birds\
to nest in its branches.\
5:03\
The mustard seed represents\
a small but growing faith.\
5:10\
The Lord does not require\
perfect faith for us\
5:15\
to have access to\
His perfect power.\
5:18\
But He does ask us to believe.\
5:24\
My dear brothers and sisters, my\
call to you this Easter morning\
5:28\
is to start today to\
increase your faith.\
5:35\
Through your faith, Jesus Christ\
will increase your ability\
5:39\
to move the mountains\
in your life,\
5:42\
even though your\
personal challenges may\
5:45\
loom as large as Mount Everest.\
5:49\
Your mountains may be\
loneliness, doubt, illness,\
5:55\
or other personal problems.\
5:59\
Your mountains\
will vary, and yet\
6:02\
the answer to each\
of your challenges\
6:05\
is to increase your faith.\
6:09\
That takes work.\
6:11\
Lazy learners and lax\
disciples will always\
6:17\
struggle to muster even\
a particle of faith.\
6:22\
To do anything well\
requires effort.\
6:26\
Becoming a true disciple of\
Jesus Christ is no exception.\
6:31\
Increasing your faith and\
trust in Him takes effort.\
6:38\
May I offer five suggestions\
to help you develop that faith\
6:42\
and trust.\
6:45\
First, study.\
6:48\
Become an engaged learner.\
6:52\
Immerse yourself in the\
scriptures to understand better\
6:55\
Christ's mission and ministry.\
6:58\
Know the doctrine of Christ so\
that you understand its power\
7:03\
for your life.\
7:06\
Internalize the truth that\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ\
7:10\
applies to you.\
7:14\
He took upon Himself your\
misery, your mistakes,\
7:19\
your weakness, and your sins.\
7:23\
He paid the compensatory price\
and provided the power for you\
7:29\
to move every mountain you will\
7:32\
ever face.\
7:34\
You obtain that power with your\
faith, trust, and willingness\
7:39\
to follow Him.\
7:42\
Moving your mountains\
may require a miracle.\
7:45\
Learn about miracles.\
7:48\
Miracles come according\
to your faith in the Lord.\
7:52\
Central to that faith\
is trusting His will\
7:57\
and timetable--how and\
when He will bless you with\
8:02\
the miraculous help you desire.\
8:05\
Only your unbelief will\
keep God from blessing\
8:10\
you with miracles to move\
the mountains in your life.\
8:19\
The more you learn\
about the Savior,\
8:20\
the easier it will be\
to trust in His mercy,\
8:23\
His infinite love, and His\
strengthening, healing,\
8:28\
redeeming power.\
8:32\
The Savior is\
never closer to you\
8:35\
than when you are facing or\
climbing a mountain with faith.\
8:43\
Second, choose to\
believe in Jesus Christ.\
8:48\
If you have doubts about God\
the Father and His Beloved Son\
8:53\
or the validity\
of the Restoration\
8:56\
or the veracity of Joseph\
Smith's divine calling\
9:00\
as a prophet, choose to\
believe and stay faithful.\
9:07\
Take your questions to the Lord\
and to other faithful sources.\
9:13\
Study with the desire\
to believe rather than\
9:18\
with the hope that\
you can find a flaw\
9:21\
in the fabric of\
a prophet's life\
9:23\
or a discrepancy\
in the scriptures.\
9:27\
Stop increasing your\
doubts by rehearsing them\
9:32\
with other doubters.\
9:36\
Allow the Lord to lead\
you on your journey of\
9:41\
spiritual discovery.\
9:46\
Third, act in faith.\
9:51\
What would you do if\
you had more faith?\
9:54\
Think about it.\
9:56\
Write about it.\
9:57\
Then receive more faith\
by doing something\
10:01\
that requires more faith.\
10:05\
Fourth, partake of sacred\
ordinances worthily.\
10:12\
Ordinances unlock the\
power of God for your life.\
10:19\
And fifth, ask your\
Heavenly Father,\
10:23\
in the name of Jesus\
Christ, for help.\
10:29\
Faith takes work.\
10:31\
Receiving revelation takes work.\
10:35\
But "every one that\
asketh receiveth;\
10:39\
and he that seeketh\
findeth; and to him that\
10:44\
knocketh it shall be opened."\
10:49\
God knows what will\
help your faith grow.\
10:54\
Ask, and then ask again.\
11:01\
A nonbeliever might say\
that faith is for the weak.\
11:06\
But this assertion overlooks\
the power of faith.\
11:11\
Would the Savior's\
Apostles have continued\
11:15\
to teach His doctrine\
after His death,\
11:18\
at the peril of their lives,\
if they had doubted Him?\
11:25\
Would Joseph and\
Hyrum Smith have\
11:27\
suffered martyrs' deaths\
defending the Restoration\
11:31\
of the Lord's Church unless\
they had a sure witness that it\
11:35\
was true?\
11:38\
Would nearly 2,000 Saints have\
died along the pioneer trail\
11:44\
if they did not have faith\
that the gospel of Jesus Christ\
11:48\
had been restored?\
11:50\
Truly, faith is the power\
that enables the unlikely\
11:55\
to accomplish the impossible.\
12:00\
Do not minimize the\
faith you already have.\
12:03\
It takes faith to join the\
Church and remain faithful.\
12:08\
It takes faith to follow\
prophets rather than\
12:11\
pundits and popular opinion.\
12:16\
It takes faith to serve a\
mission during a pandemic.\
12:21\
It takes faith to\
live a chaste life\
12:23\
when the world shouts\
that God's law of chastity\
12:27\
is now outmoded.\
12:30\
It takes faith to\
teach the gospel\
12:33\
to children in a secular world.\
12:36\
It takes faith to plead for\
the life of a loved one,\
12:41\
and even more faith to accept\
a disappointing answer.\
12:49\
Two years ago,\
Sister Nelson and I\
12:52\
visited Samoa, Tonga,\
Fiji, and Tahiti.\
12:58\
Each of those island\
nations had experienced\
13:02\
heavy rains for days.\
13:05\
Members had fasted and prayed\
that their outdoor meetings\
13:09\
would be protected\
from the rain.\
13:13\
In Samoa, Fiji, and Tahiti,\
just as the meetings began,\
13:18\
the rain stopped.\
13:22\
But in Tonga, the\
rain did not stop.\
13:26\
Yet 13,000 faithful Saints\
came hours early to get a seat,\
13:33\
waited patiently through\
a steady downpour,\
13:36\
and then sat through a\
very wet two-hour meeting.\
13:42\
We saw vibrant faith at\
work among each of those\
13:47\
islanders--faith sufficient\
to stop the rain and faith\
13:51\
to persevere when the\
rain did not stop.\
13:58\
The mountains in our\
lives do not always\
14:00\
move how or when we would like.\
14:04\
But our faith will\
always propel us forward.\
14:08\
Faith always increases\
our access to godly power.\
14:17\
Please know this: if\
everything and everyone\
14:21\
else in the world whom\
you trust should fail,\
14:27\
Jesus Christ and His\
Church will never fail you.\
14:32\
The Lord never slumbers,\
nor does He sleep.\
14:35\
He "is the same yesterday,\
today, and [tomorrow]."\
14:38\
He will not forsake His\
covenants, His promises,\
14:45\
or His love for His people.\
14:48\
He works miracles today, and\
He will work miracles tomorrow.\
14:55\
Faith in Jesus Christ\
is the greatest power\
14:59\
available to us in this life.\
15:01\
All things are possible\
to them that believe.\
15:07\
Your growing faith in Him\
will move mountains--not\
15:12\
the mountains of rock\
that beautify the earth,\
15:16\
but the mountains of\
misery in your lives.\
15:22\
Your flourishing faith will\
help you turn challenges\
15:26\
into unparalleled\
growth and opportunity.\
15:32\
On this Easter Sunday,\
with my deep feelings\
15:37\
of love and gratitude,\
I declare my witness\
15:42\
that Jesus Christ\
is indeed risen.\
15:46\
He is risen to lead His Church.\
15:51\
He is risen to bless the lives\
of all of God's children,\
15:56\
wherever they live.\
15:58\
With faith in Him, we can move\
the mountains in our lives.\
16:05\
I so testify in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
