My dear brothers and\
sisters, I rejoice with you\
0:04\
on this blessed Easter\
Sunday in contemplating\
0:07\
the glorious light that\
dawned on the earth\
0:09\
with the Resurrection of our\
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\
0:13\
During His mortal\
ministry, Jesus declared,\
0:16\
"I am the light of\
the world: he that\
0:18\
followeth me shall\
not walk in darkness,\
0:20\
but shall have the\
light of life."\
0:23\
The Spirit of Christ\
"is in all things,\
0:26\
[and] giveth life\
to all things."\
0:28\
It conquers the darkness that\
otherwise would surround us.\
0:32\
Years ago, in\
search of adventure,\
0:34\
my two sons and I accompanied\
a Young Men's group\
0:36\
to the Moaning Cavern, so named\
for a sound that at one time\
0:40\
echoed out of its mouth.\
0:41\
The cavern is a\
chimney cave which\
0:43\
opens into a 180-foot-deep\
vertical chamber, the largest\
0:48\
single-cave chamber\
in California.\
0:50\
There are only two ways down:\
the safe circular staircase\
0:54\
or rappelling to\
the cavern's floor.\
0:57\
My sons and I chose to rappel.\
0:59\
My older son went first\
while I and my younger son\
1:01\
purposely went last so that\
we would descend together.\
1:05\
After our guides instructed\
and secured us with harness\
1:08\
and belay gear to\
a strong rope, we\
1:11\
inched backward until we\
stood on a small ledge\
1:13\
and gathered our confidence,\
as this was the last place\
1:16\
to turn around and the last\
place we could see any sunlight\
1:20\
from the mouth of the cave.\
1:22\
Our next step plunged us\
backwards into a cathedral\
1:25\
cavern so tall and wide\
that it could swallow\
1:28\
the entire Statue of Liberty.\
1:30\
There we dangled in a slow\
spin, as our eyes adjusted\
1:34\
to the relative darkness.\
1:35\
As we continued our descent,\
the glow of electric lights\
1:39\
illuminated an amazing\
wall of glistening\
1:41\
stalagmites and stalactites.\
1:43\
Without warning, the lights\
went suddenly completely out.\
1:48\
Suspended above\
the abyss, we were\
1:50\
engulfed in a\
darkness so profound\
1:52\
that we could not\
even see our hands\
1:54\
on the ropes in front of us.\
1:56\
A voice instantly called out,\
"Dad, Dad, are you there?"\
2:01\
"I'm here, son.\
2:02\
I'm right here," I responded.\
2:04\
The unexpected loss\
of light was designed\
2:06\
to show that without\
electricity, the darkness\
2:09\
of the cavern was impenetrable.\
2:11\
It succeeded; we\
"felt" the darkness.\
2:15\
When the lights did return,\
the darkness instantly\
2:17\
surrendered, as darkness\
must always surrender\
2:19\
to even the faintest light.\
2:21\
My sons and I have\
been left with a memory\
2:24\
of a darkness we\
had never known,\
2:26\
a greater appreciation for\
light we will never forget,\
2:29\
and the assurance that we are\
never all alone in the dark.\
2:34\
Our descent into that\
cavern in some ways\
2:36\
parallels our journey\
through mortality.\
2:39\
We departed from the\
glorious light of heaven\
2:41\
and descended through\
a veil of forgetfulness\
2:43\
to a darkened world.\
2:45\
Our Heavenly Father did\
not abandon us to darkness\
2:48\
but promised us\
light for our journey\
2:50\
through His Beloved\
Son, Jesus Christ.\
2:53\
We know that sunlight is\
vital to all life on earth.\
2:57\
Equally vital to\
our spiritual life\
2:59\
is the light that\
emanates from our Savior.\
3:02\
In His perfect love, God\
grants the light of Christ\
3:05\
to every person "that\
cometh into the world"\
3:08\
that they may "know\
good from evil"\
3:10\
and be prompted "to\
do good continually."\
3:13\
That light, revealing\
itself through what we often\
3:16\
call our conscience,\
beckons us ever\
3:18\
to act and be better,\
to be our best self.\
3:22\
As we intensify our\
faith in Christ,\
3:25\
we receive light in\
intensifying measure\
3:27\
until it dispels all darkness\
that might gather around us.\
3:31\
"That which is of\
God is light; and he\
3:35\
that receiveth light,\
and continueth in God,\
3:37\
receiveth more\
light; and that light\
3:40\
groweth brighter and brighter\
until the perfect day."\
3:43\
The light of Christ prepares\
us to receive the ministering\
3:46\
influence of the\
Holy Ghost, which\
3:49\
is "the convincing power of\
God" of the truth of the gospel.\
3:53\
The third member of the\
Godhead, the Holy Ghost\
3:56\
"is a personage of Spirit."\
3:57\
The greatest source of light\
that Heavenly Father imparts\
4:00\
to you in mortality comes\
through the Holy Ghost,\
4:04\
whose influence "shall\
enlighten your mind,\
4:07\
[and] fill your soul with joy."\
4:10\
In The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints,\
4:12\
through restored\
priesthood authority,\
4:14\
you are baptized by immersion\
for the remission of sins.\
4:18\
Then hands are laid on your\
head and this wonderful,\
4:22\
"unspeakable gift of the Holy\
Ghost" is bestowed upon you.\
4:26\
Thereafter, when your\
desires and actions\
4:29\
are centered on\
the covenant path,\
4:31\
the Holy Ghost, as\
a light within you,\
4:33\
will reveal and\
testify of truth,\
4:36\
warn of danger,\
comfort and cleanse,\
4:39\
and provide peace to your soul.\
4:42\
Because "light\
cleaveth unto light,"\
4:44\
the constant companionship\
of the Holy Ghost\
4:46\
will lead you to\
make choices that\
4:48\
will tend to keep\
you in the light;\
4:50\
conversely, choices made without\
the Holy Ghost's influence\
4:54\
will tend to lead you\
into shadows and darkness.\
4:57\
As Elder Robert D. Hales\
taught: "When light is present,\
5:01\
darkness is vanquished\
and must depart.\
5:03\
...\
5:04\
When the spiritual light of\
the Holy Ghost is present,\
5:07\
the darkness of Satan departs."\
5:10\
May I suggest that perhaps this\
is the time to ask yourself:\
5:14\
"Do I have that\
light in my life?\
5:16\
If not, when was the\
last time I did?"\
5:20\
Just as sunlight daily bathes\
the earth to renew and sustain\
5:24\
life, you can daily brighten\
the light within you\
5:27\
when you choose to\
follow Him, Jesus Christ.\
5:30\
A drop of sunshine is added\
every time you seek God\
5:33\
in prayer, study the\
scriptures to "hear Him,"\
5:36\
act on guidance and revelation\
from our living prophets,\
5:40\
and obey and keep the\
commandments to "walk in ...\
5:42\
the ordinances of the Lord."\
5:45\
You will invite\
spiritual sunlight\
5:46\
into your soul and peace into\
your life each time you repent.\
5:51\
As you partake of the\
sacrament every week\
5:53\
to take the Savior's name upon\
you, to always remember Him\
5:56\
and keep His commandments, His\
light will shine within you.\
6:00\
There is sunshine in your soul\
every time you share the gospel\
6:04\
and bear your testimony.\
6:05\
Every time you serve one\
another as the Savior did,\
6:09\
His warmth is felt\
in your heart.\
6:11\
Heavenly Father's light always\
resides within His holy temple\
6:15\
and upon all who\
present themselves\
6:17\
in the house of the Lord.\
6:19\
His light in you is enhanced\
with your acts of kindness,\
6:23\
patience, forgiveness,\
charity and shows itself\
6:28\
in your happy countenance.\
6:30\
On the other hand,\
we walk in shadows\
6:33\
when we are too quick to\
anger or too slow to forgive.\
6:36\
"As you keep your face\
towards the sunshine,\
6:39\
the shadows cannot help\
but fall behind you."\
6:41\
As you live to merit\
the companionship\
6:44\
of the Holy Ghost,\
you truly "increase\
6:46\
your spiritual capacity\
to receive revelation."\
6:51\
Life presents\
challenges and setbacks,\
6:53\
and we all must face some\
dark days and storms.\
6:57\
Through it all, if we "let\
God prevail in our lives,"\
7:01\
the light of the Holy\
Ghost will reveal\
7:03\
that there is purpose and\
meaning in our trials,\
7:06\
that they will ultimately\
transform us into better, more\
7:09\
complete individuals with a\
firmer faith and brighter hope\
7:13\
in Christ, knowing that\
God was there with us\
7:16\
in our dark days all along.\
7:18\
As President Nelson\
has counseled,\
7:20\
"The increasing darkness\
that accompanies\
7:22\
tribulation makes the\
light of Jesus Christ\
7:25\
shine ever brighter."\
7:27\
Seasons of our lives\
can take us to places\
7:29\
both unexpected and undesirable.\
7:32\
If sin has led you there, pull\
back the curtain of darkness\
7:35\
and begin now to humbly\
approach your Heavenly Father\
7:38\
with a broken heart and a\
contrite spirit, and repent.\
7:41\
He will hear your\
earnest prayer.\
7:44\
With courage today,\
"draw near unto [Him]\
7:47\
and [He] will draw\
near unto you."\
7:48\
You are never beyond the\
healing power of the Atonement\
7:51\
of Jesus Christ.\
7:53\
I come from goodly parents and\
from faithful ancestors who\
7:56\
responded to the light of\
Jesus Christ and His gospel,\
7:59\
and it blessed their\
lives and the generations\
8:01\
that have followed with\
spiritual resilience.\
8:04\
My dad often talked about\
his father, Milo T. Dyches,\
8:07\
and shared how his faith\
in God was a light to him\
8:09\
day and night.\
8:11\
Grandpa was a forest\
ranger and often rode alone\
8:13\
in the mountains, entrusting\
his life without question\
8:16\
to God's direction and care.\
8:18\
Late one fall, Grandpa was\
alone in the high mountains.\
8:22\
Winter had already\
shown its face\
8:23\
when he saddled one of his\
favorite horses, old Prince,\
8:26\
and rode to a sawmill\
to scale and measure\
8:29\
logs before they could\
be sawn into lumber.\
8:31\
At dusk, he finished his\
work and climbed back\
8:34\
into the saddle.\
8:35\
By then, the temperature\
had plummeted,\
8:37\
and a fierce winter snowstorm\
was engulfing the mountain.\
8:40\
With neither light\
nor path to guide him,\
8:43\
he turned Prince in a\
direction he thought\
8:45\
would lead them back\
to the ranger station.\
8:47\
After traveling\
miles in the dark,\
8:49\
Prince slowed, then stopped.\
8:52\
Grandpa repeatedly urged Prince\
forward, but the horse refused.\
8:56\
With blinding snow\
swirling around them,\
8:59\
Grandpa realized he\
needed God's help.\
9:02\
As he had done\
throughout his life,\
9:03\
he humbly "ask[ed] in\
faith, nothing wavering."\
9:06\
A still, small voice answered,\
"Milo, give Prince his head."\
9:12\
Grandpa obeyed, and as\
he lightened his hold\
9:14\
on the reins, Prince swung\
around and plodded off\
9:17\
in a different direction.\
9:18\
Hours later, Prince again\
halted and lowered his head.\
9:21\
Through the driving\
snow, Grandpa\
9:23\
saw that they had safely arrived\
at the gate of the ranger\
9:25\
station.\
9:27\
With the morning sun, Grandpa\
retraced the faint tracks\
9:30\
of Prince in the snow.\
9:32\
He drew a deep breath\
when he found where\
9:33\
he had given Prince his head.\
9:35\
It was the very brink of a\
lofty mountain cliff, where\
9:38\
a single step forward would\
have plunged both horse\
9:40\
and rider to their deaths\
in the rugged rocks below.\
9:44\
Based on that experience and\
many others, Grandpa counseled,\
9:47\
"The best and greatest\
partner you will ever have\
9:50\
is your Father in Heaven."\
9:51\
When my dad would\
relate Grandpa's story,\
9:53\
I remember he would quote\
from the scriptures: "Trust\
9:57\
in the Lord with\
all thine heart;\
9:58\
and lean not unto thine\
own understanding.\
10:00\
In all thy ways acknowledge him,\
and he shall direct thy paths."\
10:05\
I testify that Jesus Christ\
is the everlasting Light that\
10:08\
"[shines] in the darkness."\
10:09\
There is no darkness\
that can ever\
10:11\
suppress, extinguish,\
overpower, or defeat that light.\
10:15\
Our Heavenly Father freely\
offers that light to you.\
10:21\
You are never alone.\
10:24\
He hears and answers\
every prayer.\
10:27\
He has called you\
"out of darkness\
10:29\
into his marvellous light."\
10:31\
When you ask, "Father,\
Father, are you there?"\
10:34\
He will always reply,\
"I'm here, child of mine.\
10:38\
I'm right here."\
10:40\
I bear witness that Jesus Christ\
fulfilled Heavenly Father's\
10:43\
plan as our Savior and Redeemer.\
10:45\
He is our light, our\
life, and our way.\
10:47\
His light will never dim,\
His glory will never cease,\
10:51\
His love for you is eternal,\
yesterday, today, and forever.\
10:57\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
