As a boy I remember driving\
in the car with my father\
0:03\
and seeing individuals\
on the roadside\
0:05\
who had found themselves\
in difficult circumstances\
0:08\
or who needed help.\
0:10\
My father would always make\
the comment, "pobrecito,"\
0:13\
which means "poor little one."\
0:16\
On occasion, I\
watched with interest\
0:17\
as my father would help many\
of these people, especially\
0:21\
when we would travel to\
Mexico to see my grandparents.\
0:23\
He would typically\
find someone in need\
0:26\
and then go privately\
and provide that help\
0:28\
that they needed.\
0:29\
I later discovered that he was\
helping them enroll in school,\
0:32\
buy some food, or provide\
in some way or another\
0:35\
for their well-being.\
0:36\
He was ministering to\
a "poor little one"\
0:39\
that came across his path.\
0:41\
In fact, in my growing up years\
I cannot remember a time when\
0:44\
we did not have someone living\
with us who needed a place\
0:47\
to stay as they\
became self-reliant.\
0:49\
Watching these experiences\
created a spirit of compassion\
0:53\
towards my fellow man\
and for those in need.\
0:57\
In Preach My Gospel it states,\
"you are surrounded by people.\
1:00\
You pass them on the street,\
visit them in their homes,\
1:03\
and travel among them.\
1:04\
They are all children of God,\
your brothers and sisters.\
1:07\
... many of these people are\
searching for purpose in life.\
1:10\
They are concerned for their\
future and their families."\
1:14\
Throughout the years in\
serving in the Church,\
1:16\
I have tried to seek after those\
who needed help in their lives\
1:19\
both temporally and spiritually.\
1:21\
I would often hear the voice of\
my father saying "pobrecito,"\
1:25\
poor little one.\
1:27\
In the Bible we find\
a wonderful example\
1:30\
of caring for a poor little one.\
1:31\
"Now Peter and John went up\
together [in]to the temple\
1:34\
at the hour of prayer,\
being the ninth hour.\
1:37\
And a certain man lame\
from his mother's womb\
1:39\
was carried, whom\
they laid daily\
1:41\
at the gate of the temple which\
is called Beautiful, to ask\
1:45\
alms of them that entered\
into the temple; Who\
1:47\
seeing Peter and John\
about to go into the temple\
1:50\
asked an alms.\
1:51\
And Peter, fastening his\
eyes upon him with John,\
1:54\
said, Look on us.\
1:56\
And he gave heed\
unto them, expecting\
1:57\
to receive something of them.\
2:00\
"Then Peter said,\
Silver and gold\
2:02\
have I none; but such\
as I have give I thee:\
2:06\
In the name of Jesus Christ\
of Nazareth rise up and walk.\
2:10\
And he took him by the right\
hand, and lifted him up:\
2:13\
and immediately his feet and\
ankle bones received strength."\
2:17\
In reading this account,\
I was intrigued by the use\
2:20\
of the word fastening.\
2:21\
The word fastening means "to\
direct one's eyes, thoughts,\
2:25\
or look intently at."\
2:26\
As Peter looked at this\
man, he saw him differently\
2:29\
than others.\
2:30\
He looked past his inability\
to walk and weaknesses\
2:33\
and could discern\
that his faith was\
2:36\
adequate to become healed\
and enter into the temple\
2:40\
to receive the blessings\
he was seeking.\
2:42\
I noticed that he took\
him by the right hand\
2:45\
and lifted him up\
2:45\
as he assisted the\
man in this way.\
2:47\
The Lord miraculously\
healed him,\
2:51\
and "his feet and ankle\
bones received strength."\
2:54\
His love for this man\
and a desire to help him\
2:56\
caused an increase of\
capacity and ability\
3:00\
in the man who was weak.\
3:02\
While serving as\
an Area Seventy,\
3:04\
I reserved each Tuesday night\
to do ministering visits\
3:07\
with the stake presidents in\
my area of responsibility.\
3:10\
I invited them to\
make appointments\
3:11\
with those who were in need\
of an ordinance of the gospel\
3:14\
of Jesus Christ or who were not\
currently keeping the covenants\
3:17\
that they had made.\
3:18\
Through our consistent and\
intentional ministering,\
3:22\
the Lord magnified\
our efforts, and we\
3:24\
were able to find individuals\
and families who were in need.\
3:28\
These were the poor\
little ones who\
3:30\
lived in the different\
stakes where we served.\
3:33\
On one occasion, I accompanied\
President Bill Whitworth,\
3:36\
the president of\
the Sandy Canyon\
3:38\
View stake, to do\
ministering visits.\
3:40\
He was prayerful about\
whom we should visit,\
3:42\
trying to have the same\
experience as Nephi, who\
3:45\
"was led by the Spirit,\
not knowing beforehand\
3:48\
the things which\
[he] should do."\
3:50\
He demonstrated\
that as we minister,\
3:52\
we should be led by revelation\
to those who are most\
3:55\
in need, as opposed to\
just going down a list\
3:58\
or visiting people\
in a methodical way.\
4:01\
We should be led by the\
power of inspiration.\
4:06\
I remember going into the\
home of a young couple, Jeff\
4:08\
and Heather, and\
their little boy, Kai.\
4:10\
Jeff grew up an active\
member of the Church.\
4:12\
He was a very talented athlete\
and had a promising career.\
4:16\
He began to drift\
away from the Church\
4:18\
in his early teenage years.\
4:20\
Later, he got into a\
car accident, which\
4:22\
altered the course of his life.\
4:26\
As we entered into the\
home and became acquainted,\
4:29\
Jeff asked us why we\
came to see his family.\
4:33\
We responded that there were\
about 3,000 members who lived\
4:36\
within the stake boundaries.\
4:38\
I then asked him,\
"Jeff, of all the homes\
4:41\
we could have visited\
tonight, tell us\
4:43\
why the Lord has sent us here."\
4:46\
With that, Jeff became\
emotional and began\
4:49\
to share with us\
some of his worries\
4:51\
and some issues that they\
were dealing with as a family.\
4:53\
We began to share various\
4:55\
principles of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
4:57\
We invited them to do a\
few specific things that\
5:00\
might seem to be\
challenging at first\
5:03\
but in time would bring\
great happiness and joy.\
5:07\
Then President Whitworth gave\
Jeff a priesthood blessing\
5:11\
to help him overcome\
his challenges.\
5:14\
Jeff and Heather agreed to do\
what we invited them to do.\
5:18\
About a year later\
it was my privilege\
5:21\
to watch Jeff baptize\
his wife, Heather,\
5:24\
a member of the Church\
of Jesus Christ of\
5:26\
Latter-day Saints.\
5:28\
They are now\
preparing themselves\
5:30\
to enter the temple to be\
sealed as a family for time\
5:33\
and all eternity.\
5:34\
Our visit altered the course of\
their lives both temporally and\
5:39\
spiritually.\
5:41\
THE LORD HAS STATED:\
"Wherefore be faithful;\
5:44\
stand in the office which\
I have appointed unto\
5:46\
you; succor the weak, lift up\
the hands [that] hang down,\
5:49\
and strengthen the feeble knees.\
5:51\
And in doing these\
things thou wilt\
5:53\
do the greatest good\
unto thy fellow beings,\
5:55\
and wilt promote the glory\
of him who is your Lord."\
6:00\
Brothers and Sisters,\
the Apostle Paul\
6:02\
taught a key element\
in our ministering.\
6:04\
He taught that we are all "the\
body of Christ, and members\
6:07\
in particular" and that\
each member of the body\
6:10\
is needed to ensure that\
the entire body is edified.\
6:14\
He then taught a powerful\
principle that entered deeply\
6:16\
into my heart when I read it.\
6:18\
He said, "much more those\
members of the body,\
6:22\
which seem to be more\
feeble, are necessary:\
6:25\
And those members of the body,\
which we think to be less\
6:28\
honourable, upon these we\
bestow more abundant honour."\
6:33\
Hence, in each ward and branch\
we need everyone--those who may\
6:36\
be strong and those who\
are perhaps struggling.\
6:39\
All are necessary to\
the vital edification\
6:42\
of the entire "body of Christ."\
6:45\
I often wonder\
who we are missing\
6:46\
in our various congregations\
that would strengthen\
6:49\
us and make us whole.\
6:52\
In 1849 Brigham\
Young had a dream\
6:55\
where he saw the Prophet\
Joseph Smith driving a\
6:58\
large herd of sheep and goats.\
7:01\
Some of these animals\
were large and beautiful;\
7:03\
others were small and dirty.\
7:05\
Brigham recalled looking into\
the Prophet Joseph Smith's eyes\
7:08\
and saying, "Joseph, you have\
got the darndest flock...\
7:11\
I ever saw in my life; what\
are you going to do with them?"\
7:14\
The Prophet, who\
seemed unconcerned\
7:17\
with this unruly flock,\
simply replied: "Brigham,\
7:21\
They are all good\
in their places."\
7:23\
When President Young\
awoke, he understood\
7:25\
that while the Church will\
gather a variety of "sheep\
7:28\
and goats," it was his\
responsibility to bring all in\
7:31\
and allow each of\
them to realize\
7:33\
their full potential\
as they took\
7:36\
their places in the Church.\
7:38\
Brothers and Sisters,\
the genesis of my talk\
7:40\
came as I thought\
deeply about one\
7:43\
who is not engaged in The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
7:47\
Saints.\
7:48\
For a moment I would like to\
speak to each one of them.\
7:52\
Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught\
that "such individuals often\
7:56\
stay proximate to--but do\
not participate fully in--the\
8:01\
Church.\
8:02\
They will not come\
inside the chapel,\
8:04\
but neither do they\
leave its porch.\
8:06\
These are they who need and\
are needed by the Church,\
8:10\
but who in part, 'live\
without God in the world.'"\
8:15\
I would echo the invitation of\
our beloved President Russell\
8:18\
M. Nelson as he\
first spoke to the\
8:20\
membership of the church.\
8:22\
"Now, to each\
member of the Church\
8:23\
I say: Keep on\
the covenant path.\
8:26\
Your commitment to\
follow the Savior\
8:28\
by making covenants with Him\
and then keeping those covenants\
8:32\
will open the door to\
every spiritual blessing\
8:35\
and privilege available to men,\
8:37\
women, and children."\
8:40\
HE THEN PLEADED: "Now, if you\
have stepped off the path,\
8:43\
may I invite you with\
all the hope in my heart\
8:47\
to please come back.\
8:48\
Whatever your concerns,\
whatever your challenges,\
8:51\
there is a place for you\
in this, the Lord's Church.\
8:54\
You and generations yet unborn\
will be blessed by your actions\
8:58\
now to return to\
the covenant path."\
9:03\
I bear witness of Him, even\
Jesus Christ, the Master,\
9:07\
minister, and Savior of us all.\
9:10\
I invite each of us to\
seek out the pobrecitos,\
9:13\
the poor little ones\
among us who are in need,\
9:17\
is my hope and prayer\
in the sacred name\
9:20\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
