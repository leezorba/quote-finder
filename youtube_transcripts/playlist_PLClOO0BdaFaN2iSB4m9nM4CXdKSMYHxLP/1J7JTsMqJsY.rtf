Our dear prophet, President\
Russell M. Nelson,\
0:03\
said in our last\
general conference,\
0:06\
"During these perilous\
times of which the Apostle\
0:10\
Paul prophesied, Satan is no\
longer even trying to hide\
0:16\
his attacks on God's plan.\
0:19\
Emboldened evil abounds.\
0:24\
Therefore, the\
only way to survive\
0:26\
spiritually is to be\
determined to let God prevail\
0:31\
in our lives, to learn\
to hear His voice,\
0:37\
and to use our energy\
to help gather Israel."\
0:43\
As we consider the\
prophet's invitation\
0:46\
to learn to hear God's\
voice, are our hearts\
0:50\
determined or hardened?\
0:55\
Let us remember the\
counsel given in Jacob 6:6:\
1:01\
"Yea, today, if ye\
will hear his voice,\
1:06\
harden not your hearts;\
for why will ye die?"\
1:15\
Let us be determined to let\
God prevail in our lives.\
1:22\
How can we let God prevail\
in our lives and not\
1:25\
the adversary?\
1:27\
In Doctrine and Covenants 6:34\
we read, "Therefore, fear not,\
1:36\
little flock; do good; let earth\
and hell combine against you,\
1:43\
for if ye are built upon my\
rock, they cannot prevail."\
1:50\
It is a significant promise.\
1:53\
Although earth and hell may\
combine against us, they cannot\
1:59\
prevail if we choose to let\
God prevail by establishing\
2:07\
our lives upon His rock.\
2:13\
Speaking to His\
disciples, Jesus Christ\
2:18\
taught of a wise man\
and a foolish man,\
2:22\
recorded in Matthew chapter 7\
2:25\
of the New Testament.\
2:28\
Many of you have heard the\
Primary song "The Wise Man\
2:33\
and the Foolish Man."\
2:36\
If you have taken the\
time to compare the four\
2:40\
verses in the\
song, you will find\
2:44\
that verses one and two are\
very similar to verses three\
2:49\
and four.\
2:53\
Both the wise man\
and the foolish man\
2:57\
were building a house.\
2:59\
They want to\
provide their family\
3:02\
with a safe and\
comfortable home.\
3:05\
They desire to live happily\
together forever as a family,\
3:12\
just like you and me.\
3:15\
The surrounding situation was\
the same: "The rains came down,\
3:23\
and the floods came up."\
3:27\
We sing it six times\
when we sing that song.\
3:30\
The only difference is that\
the wise man built his house\
3:34\
upon the rock and the\
house stood still,\
3:40\
whereas the foolish man\
built his house upon the sand\
3:46\
and his house washed away.\
3:49\
Therefore, where our\
foundation is really\
3:54\
matters, and this has a\
decisive effect on the outcome\
4:01\
ultimately and eternally.\
4:07\
I hope and pray that we\
all will find and stay\
4:11\
on the sure foundation as we\
establish our future life.\
4:17\
We are reminded in Helaman 5:12,\
"And now, my sons, remember,\
4:27\
remember that it is upon\
the rock of our Redeemer,\
4:31\
who is Christ, the Son of\
God, that ye must build\
4:36\
your foundation; that when\
the devil shall send forth his\
4:41\
mighty winds, yea, his\
shafts in the whirlwind, yea,\
4:49\
when all his hail and his mighty\
storm shall beat upon you,\
4:56\
it shall have no power over you\
to drag you down to the gulf\
5:03\
of misery and endless wo,\
because of the rock upon which\
5:09\
ye are built, which\
is a sure foundation,\
5:13\
a foundation whereon if men\
build they cannot fall."\
5:21\
That is the promise from God!\
5:24\
If we build our foundation on\
Jesus Christ, we cannot fall!\
5:30\
As we endure\
faithfully to the end,\
5:33\
God will help us establish\
our lives upon His rock,\
5:38\
and the gates of hell shall\
not prevail against us.\
5:44\
We may not be able to change\
all of what is coming,\
5:50\
but we can choose how we\
prepare for what is coming.\
5:57\
Some of us may think,\
"The gospel is good,\
6:00\
so we need to put it in our\
lives maybe once a week."\
6:08\
Just going to church\
once a week is not\
6:11\
enough to build upon the rock.\
6:14\
Our entire lives should\
be filled with the gospel\
6:19\
of Jesus Christ.\
6:22\
The gospel is not\
part of our life,\
6:26\
but our life is actually part\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
6:34\
Think about it.\
6:37\
Is that not true?\
6:42\
Our mortal life is only\
part of the whole plan\
6:45\
of salvation and exaltation.\
6:50\
God is our Heavenly Father.\
6:53\
He loves all of us.\
6:56\
He knows our potential way\
better than we know ourselves.\
7:01\
He knows not only the\
details of our lives;\
7:06\
God knows the details\
of the details\
7:12\
of the details of our lives.\
7:15\
Please follow our living\
prophet, President Nelson's\
7:19\
wise counsel.\
7:22\
As recorded in the Doctrine\
and Covenants 21:5-6:\
7:29\
"For his word ye shall receive,\
as if from mine own mouth,\
7:34\
in all patience and faith.\
7:40\
For by doing these things the\
gates of hell shall not prevail\
7:45\
against you; yea,\
and the Lord ...\
7:50\
will disperse the powers of\
darkness from before you,\
7:54\
and cause the heavens\
to shake for your good,\
8:00\
and his name's glory."\
8:03\
For that reason, they cannot\
prevail, and we cannot fall!\
8:11\
I testify to you that\
Christ will come again\
8:14\
a second time as He\
did the first time,\
8:17\
but this time it will be\
with great glory and majesty.\
8:22\
I hope and pray that I will\
be ready to receive Him,\
8:27\
whether on this side of the\
veil or on the other side.\
8:31\
As we celebrate in this\
wonderful Easter season,\
8:35\
I hope, through the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ\
8:40\
and the power of\
His Resurrection,\
8:42\
I will be able to go up and\
meet with my Maker and say,\
8:48\
"Thank You."\
8:49\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
