My dear brethren\
of the priesthood,\
0:04\
One of the most memorable lines\
in a much-loved hymn asks,\
0:09\
"Shall the youth\
of Zion falter?"\
0:13\
My heartfelt and\
resounding declaration\
0:16\
in answer to that\
question is "No!"\
0:20\
To make sure that\
answer holds true,\
0:24\
I testify today that supporting\
the rising generation\
0:28\
in a time of unusual\
challenges and temptations\
0:32\
is an essential responsibility\
given to parents and bishoprics\
0:37\
by Heavenly Father.\
0:39\
Let me illustrate the\
importance of a bishopric\
0:42\
with a personal experience.\
0:44\
When I was a deacon, my\
family moved to a new home\
0:47\
in a different ward.\
0:48\
I was beginning\
junior high school,\
0:51\
so I also attended a new school.\
0:53\
There was a marvelous\
group of young men\
0:56\
in the deacons quorum.\
0:57\
Most of their parents\
were active members.\
1:00\
My mother was completely\
active; my father\
1:03\
was exceptional in every way\
but was not an active member.\
1:08\
The second counselor in the\
bishopric, Brother Dean Eyre,\
1:11\
was a devoted leader.\
1:13\
When I was still\
adjusting to the new ward,\
1:16\
a father-son event was announced\
for Bear Lake--about 40 miles\
1:20\
away.\
1:21\
I did not think I would\
attend without my father.\
1:24\
But Brother Eyre issued a\
special invitation for me\
1:28\
to go with him.\
1:29\
He spoke highly and\
respectfully of my father\
1:33\
and stressed the significance\
of my opportunity\
1:36\
to be with the other members\
of the deacons quorum.\
1:39\
So I decided to go\
with Brother Eyre,\
1:42\
and I had a\
wonderful experience.\
1:44\
Brother Eyre was a marvelous\
example of Christlike love\
1:48\
in fulfilling the\
bishopric's responsibility\
1:51\
to support parents in watching\
over and nurturing the youth.\
1:56\
He gave me an excellent\
start in this new ward\
2:00\
and was a mentor to me.\
2:03\
A few months before I left\
for a mission in 1960,\
2:06\
Brother Eyre passed away\
from cancer at age 39.\
2:09\
He left a wife and their\
five children, all younger\
2:14\
than age 16.\
2:16\
His oldest sons,\
Richard and Chris Eyre,\
2:20\
have assured me that in the\
absence of their father,\
2:24\
bishoprics supported and watched\
out for them and their younger\
2:28\
brothers and sister with\
Christlike love, for which I\
2:33\
am grateful.\
2:35\
Parents will always have\
the main responsibility\
2:37\
for their families.\
2:38\
Quorum presidencies also provide\
essential support and guidance\
2:43\
to quorum members\
by assisting them\
2:45\
in elevating the duties and\
power of the Aaronic Priesthood\
2:50\
to the center of their lives.\
2:52\
Today my purpose is to focus on\
bishops and their counselors,\
2:57\
who can appropriately be\
called "shepherds over\
3:00\
the Lord's flock"--with\
emphasis on being shepherds\
3:05\
for the rising generation.\
3:07\
It is interesting\
that the Apostle Peter\
3:09\
referred to Jesus Christ\
as "the Shepherd and Bishop\
3:13\
of your souls."\
3:15\
The bishop has five\
principal responsibilities\
3:18\
in presiding over a ward: He\
is the presiding high priest\
3:22\
in the ward.\
3:23\
He is president of the\
Aaronic Priesthood.\
3:26\
He is a common judge.\
3:28\
He coordinates the work of\
salvation and exaltation,\
3:32\
including caring\
for those in need.\
3:35\
And he oversees records,\
finances, and the use\
3:39\
of the meetinghouse.\
3:41\
In his role as\
presiding high priest,\
3:44\
the bishop is the ward's\
"spiritual leader."\
3:47\
He is a "faithful disciple\
... of Jesus Christ."\
3:50\
In addition, "the\
bishop [coordinates]\
3:52\
the work of salvation and\
exaltation in the ward."\
3:55\
The bishop should assign the\
day-to-day responsibility\
4:00\
for sharing the gospel,\
strengthening new and returning\
4:03\
members, ministering, and\
temple and family history work\
4:08\
to the elders quorum and\
Relief Society presidencies.\
4:11\
The bishop coordinates this work\
in the ward council and ward\
4:16\
youth council.\
4:18\
The bishop has a paramount\
role in serving as a shepherd\
4:21\
to guide the rising generation,\
including young single adults,\
4:26\
to Jesus Christ.\
4:28\
President Russell M.\
Nelson has emphasized\
4:31\
the seminal role of the\
bishop and his counselors.\
4:34\
He has taught that their "first\
and foremost responsibility\
4:38\
is to care for the young men\
and young women of [their] ward.\
4:43\
The bishopric supports parents\
in watching over and nurturing\
4:48\
children and youth in the ward.\
4:50\
The bishop and ward Young Women\
president counsel together.\
4:55\
They strive to\
help the youth live\
4:57\
the standards in For\
the Strength of Youth,\
5:00\
qualify to receive\
ordinances, and make and keep\
5:05\
sacred covenants.\
5:07\
You might ask, "Why\
is the bishopric\
5:09\
directed to spend so much\
time with the youth?"\
5:13\
The Lord has\
organized His Church\
5:15\
to accomplish\
crucial priorities.\
5:18\
Accordingly, the\
organization of His Church\
5:20\
has a structure in\
which the bishop\
5:23\
has a dual responsibility.\
5:25\
He has doctrinal responsibility\
for the ward as a whole,\
5:28\
but he also has specific\
doctrinal responsibility\
5:32\
for the priests quorum.\
5:35\
The young men who are\
priests and the young women\
5:37\
of the same age are at\
a very important stage\
5:41\
in their lives and development.\
5:43\
During a short\
period of time, they\
5:46\
make decisions that have\
significant lifelong\
5:49\
implications.\
5:50\
They determine whether they\
will qualify for the temple,\
5:54\
serve a mission, strive to\
be married in the temple,\
5:57\
and prepare for\
their life's work.\
6:00\
These decisions, once made,\
have profound spiritual and\
6:04\
practical implications for\
the remainder of their lives.\
6:09\
Bishops, please know that a\
relatively short time spent\
6:13\
with a young priest, young\
woman, or young adult\
6:17\
can help them understand\
the power available to them\
6:21\
through the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ.\
6:23\
It can provide a vision that\
will have a profound influence\
6:27\
upon their entire life.\
6:30\
One of the best\
examples I have seen\
6:32\
of a bishop who helped\
provide this kind of vision\
6:34\
for his youth was\
Bishop Moa Mahe.\
6:38\
He was called to be the first\
bishop of the San Francisco\
6:41\
Tongan Ward.\
6:42\
He was an immigrant\
from Vava'u, Tonga.\
6:45\
His ward was located near\
the San Francisco California\
6:49\
Airport, where he worked.\
6:51\
The ward had a large\
number of youth, most\
6:54\
from families who had recently\
immigrated to the United\
6:57\
States.\
6:58\
Bishop Mahe not only taught\
them in word and by example\
7:03\
how to be righteous\
disciples of Jesus Christ,\
7:07\
but he also helped give them\
a vision of what they could\
7:10\
become and helped them prepare\
for the temple, missions,\
7:14\
education, and employment.\
7:17\
He served for\
almost eight years,\
7:19\
and his dreams and desires for\
the youth became a reality.\
7:24\
Nearly 90 percent of the young\
men in the Aaronic Priesthood\
7:27\
quorums served missions.\
7:29\
Fifteen young men and women\
were the first members\
7:32\
of their families\
to attend college.\
7:34\
He met with the principal of\
the local high school--not\
7:37\
of our faith--and they forged\
a friendship and collaborated\
7:42\
on how to assist each young\
person to achieve worthwhile\
7:46\
goals and overcome problems.\
7:49\
The principal told me that\
Bishop Mahe assisted him\
7:53\
in working with immigrants of\
all faiths who were struggling.\
7:56\
The young people knew that\
the bishop loved them.\
8:01\
Sadly, Bishop Mahe passed\
away while serving as bishop.\
8:05\
I will never forget his\
touching and inspiring funeral.\
8:10\
There was a huge crowd.\
8:12\
The choir was composed of more\
than 35 faithful young members\
8:17\
who had served missions\
or were attending college\
8:20\
and who had been youth\
during his service as bishop.\
8:23\
One speaker expressed the\
intense feeling of appreciation\
8:27\
from the youth and young\
adults in his ward.\
8:29\
He paid tribute to Bishop\
Mahe for the vision\
8:33\
he had given them in preparing\
for life and righteous service.\
8:38\
But most important, Bishop\
Mahe had assisted them\
8:42\
in building faith in\
the Lord Jesus Christ\
8:45\
as the foundation\
of their lives.\
8:49\
Now, bishops,\
wherever you serve,\
8:52\
in your interviews and\
other associations,\
8:55\
you can provide\
that kind of vision\
8:58\
and build faith in Jesus Christ.\
9:01\
You can extend\
powerful invitations\
9:04\
to change behavior,\
prepare them for life,\
9:07\
and inspire them to stay\
on the covenant path.\
9:10\
In addition, you\
may help some youth\
9:13\
who are in conflict with\
parents over things that\
9:16\
are relatively unimportant.\
9:19\
At a time when young\
people seem to have\
9:21\
maximum conflict\
with their parents,\
9:24\
the person who presides\
over their quorum\
9:27\
and to whom they\
answer ecclesiastically\
9:30\
is also the person\
to whom their parents\
9:33\
go for temple recommends.\
9:35\
This puts the bishop in a\
unique position to counsel\
9:39\
both the youth and their\
parents when contention\
9:43\
has created a division.\
9:44\
Bishops can help\
both view things\
9:48\
with an eternal perspective\
and resolve issues\
9:51\
of more or less importance.\
9:54\
We recommend that bishops\
not have assigned ministering\
9:58\
families so they can focus\
their time and energy\
10:03\
ministering to the\
youth and their families\
10:05\
in these kinds of situations.\
10:08\
I am aware of one bishop\
who was able to resolve\
10:11\
extreme contention between\
a son and his parents,\
10:15\
bringing harmony to the\
home and enhanced commitment\
10:18\
to the gospel.\
10:19\
The bishop helped the\
parents understand\
10:22\
that striving to be a\
disciple of Jesus Christ\
10:25\
was more important than exactly\
how and when family chores were\
10:31\
accomplished.\
10:32\
In order to spend more time\
with youth, wherever they are,\
10:37\
including at school\
events or activities,\
10:40\
bishoprics have been\
counseled to delegate\
10:44\
appropriate meetings and\
counseling time with adults.\
10:47\
While bishops can counsel\
on acute and urgent matters,\
10:52\
we recommend that delegation\
of ongoing counseling with\
10:56\
chronic, less urgent matters\
that do not involve judgments\
11:01\
as to worthiness be assigned\
to members of the elders quorum\
11:05\
or Relief Society--usually\
presidencies or ministering\
11:09\
brothers and sisters.\
11:10\
The Spirit will\
guide the leaders\
11:12\
to select the right members\
to undertake this counseling.\
11:16\
Those who receive this\
delegated counseling assignment\
11:20\
are entitled to revelation.\
11:23\
They, of course,\
must always maintain\
11:26\
strict confidentiality.\
11:29\
Thoughtful leaders\
have always sacrificed\
11:31\
for the rising generation.\
11:33\
This is where the bishopric\
members spend the majority\
11:37\
of their Church-service time.\
11:40\
I now desire to say a few\
things directly to the youth\
11:43\
and then to our bishops.\
11:45\
Many of you precious\
young people\
11:47\
may not have a clear\
vision of who you are\
11:49\
and who you can become.\
11:51\
Yet you are at the threshold\
of the most important decisions\
11:55\
you will make in your lives.\
11:57\
Please counsel with\
both your parents\
12:00\
and your bishop about important\
choices that are ahead of you.\
12:04\
Allow the bishop to be\
your friend and counselor.\
12:09\
We are aware that you have\
trials and temptations coming\
12:14\
at you from every direction.\
12:15\
We all need to repent daily,\
as President Nelson has taught.\
12:20\
Please talk to your\
bishop about any matter\
12:24\
in which a common\
judge can assist you\
12:27\
in getting your life in order\
with the Lord in preparation\
12:31\
for the "great work" He has for\
you in this final dispensation.\
12:37\
As President Nelson\
has invited you, please\
12:40\
qualify yourself to be part\
of the Lord's youth battalion!\
12:46\
Now a word for you\
precious bishops\
12:49\
on behalf of the leadership\
and members of the Church:\
12:53\
we express our deep\
gratitude to you.\
12:56\
With the adjustments that\
you have been requested\
12:59\
to make in recent\
years, dear bishops,\
13:02\
please know how much we\
love and appreciate you.\
13:05\
Your contribution to the kingdom\
is almost beyond description.\
13:10\
The Church has 30,900\
bishops and branch presidents\
13:15\
serving across the world.\
13:17\
We honor each of you.\
13:20\
Some words and the sacred\
callings they describe\
13:23\
are imbued with\
almost a spiritual,\
13:25\
transcendent significance.\
13:28\
The calling of\
bishop is definitely\
13:30\
in the top tier of such words.\
13:33\
To serve the Lord\
in this capacity\
13:37\
is remarkable in so many ways.\
13:40\
The calling, sustaining, and\
setting apart of a bishop is\
13:44\
a never-to-be-forgotten\
experience.\
13:47\
For me, it ranks with a small\
number of sublime events\
13:53\
in the wide range and depth\
of feelings it evokes.\
13:57\
It sits comfortably in a\
hierarchy of precious events\
14:02\
like marriage and fatherhood\
that cannot be described\
14:07\
in a few words.\
14:10\
Bishops, we sustain you!\
14:13\
Bishops, we love you!\
14:17\
You are truly the Lord's\
shepherds over His flock.\
14:21\
The Savior will not forsake\
you in these sacred callings.\
14:26\
Of this I testify, on\
this Easter weekend,\
14:31\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
