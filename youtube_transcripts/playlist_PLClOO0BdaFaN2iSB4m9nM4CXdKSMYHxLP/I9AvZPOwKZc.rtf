my dear brothers and sisters\
0:04\
i am grateful to be with you in this\
0:07\
first session of general conference\
0:11\
the speakers the music\
0:14\
and the prayer have brought the spirit\
0:17\
as well as a feeling of light\
0:21\
and hope that feeling has brought back\
0:25\
to my memory\
0:26\
the first day i walked into the salt\
0:29\
lake temple\
0:31\
i was a young man\
0:34\
my parents were my only companions that\
0:38\
day\
0:40\
inside they paused for a moment to be\
0:42\
created\
0:43\
to be greeted by a temple worker\
0:47\
i walked on ahead of them alone for a\
0:50\
moment\
0:52\
i was greeted by a little white-haired\
0:55\
lady\
0:56\
in a beautiful white temple dress\
0:59\
she looked up at me and smiled and then\
1:03\
said very softly\
1:06\
welcome to the temple brother irene\
1:10\
i thought for a moment she was an angel\
1:13\
because she knew my name i had not\
1:16\
realized that a small card\
1:18\
with my name on it had been placed on\
1:21\
the lapel\
1:22\
of my suit coat i stepped past her\
1:27\
and stopped i looked up\
1:30\
at a high white ceiling\
1:33\
that made the room so light it seemed\
1:36\
almost as if it were open to the sky\
1:41\
and in that moment the thought came into\
1:44\
my mind\
1:45\
in these clear words\
1:48\
i have been in this lighted place before\
1:52\
but then immediately there came into my\
1:56\
mind\
1:57\
not in my own voice these words\
2:00\
no you have never been here before\
2:04\
you are remembering a moment before you\
2:08\
were born\
2:10\
you were in a sacred place like this\
2:16\
on the outs outside of our temples\
2:19\
we place the words holiness to the lord\
2:25\
i know for myself\
2:28\
that those words are true\
2:31\
the temple is a holy place\
2:36\
where revelation comes to us\
2:39\
easily if our hearts\
2:42\
are open to it and we are worthy of it\
2:48\
later that first day i again felt the\
2:51\
same spirit\
2:53\
the temple ceremony includes some words\
2:56\
that brought a feeling of a burning in\
2:59\
my\
2:59\
heart confirming that what was being\
3:03\
portrayed\
3:04\
was true what i felt\
3:09\
was personal to me regarding my future\
3:16\
and it became a reality 40 years later\
3:19\
through a call to serve from the lord\
3:23\
i experienced the same feeling when i\
3:26\
was married\
3:27\
in the logan utah temple\
3:30\
president spencer w kimball performed\
3:33\
the ceiling\
3:36\
in the few words he spoke he gave this\
3:40\
counsel quote\
3:43\
hal and kathy live\
3:46\
so that when the call comes you can\
3:50\
walk away easily\
3:54\
as he said those few words i\
3:57\
saw clearly in my mind in\
4:01\
full color a steep hill\
4:04\
and a road leading up to the top\
4:08\
a white fence ran on the left side of\
4:11\
the road\
4:12\
and disappeared into a row of trees at\
4:15\
the top of the hill\
4:18\
a white house was barely visible\
4:21\
through the trees\
4:25\
one year later i recognized that hell\
4:30\
as my father-in-law drove us up that\
4:34\
road\
4:35\
it was in detail what i saw\
4:38\
when president kimball gave his counsel\
4:42\
in the temple when we got to the top of\
4:46\
the hill\
4:47\
my father-in-law stopped by the white\
4:50\
house\
4:52\
he told us that he and his wife were\
4:55\
buying the\
4:56\
property and that he wanted his daughter\
4:59\
and me to live in the guest house\
5:03\
they would live in the main house just a\
5:06\
few feet away\
5:08\
so during the 10 years we lived in that\
5:11\
lovely\
5:12\
family setting my wife and i would say\
5:16\
almost every day we had better\
5:19\
enjoy this because we aren't going to be\
5:22\
here long\
5:25\
a call came from the church commissioner\
5:28\
of education\
5:30\
neil a maxwell the warning given\
5:34\
by president kimball to be able to\
5:37\
walk away easily became a reality\
5:42\
it was a call to leave what seemed an\
5:45\
idyllic\
5:46\
family situation to serve\
5:49\
in an assignment in a place that i knew\
5:52\
nothing about\
5:55\
our family was ready to leave that\
5:57\
blessed time\
5:58\
and place because a prophet\
6:01\
in a holy temple a place of revelation\
6:06\
saw a future event\
6:09\
for which we then were prepared\
6:14\
i know that temples of the lord\
6:17\
are holy places my purpose today\
6:21\
in speaking of temples is to\
6:24\
increase your desire and mine\
6:28\
to be worthy and ready for the increased\
6:32\
opportunities for temple experiences\
6:35\
that are coming for us\
6:39\
for me the greatest motivation to be\
6:42\
worthy of temple experiences\
6:45\
is what the lord has said of his holy\
6:48\
houses\
6:50\
open quote insomuch as my people\
6:54\
build a house unto me in the name of the\
6:57\
lord\
6:58\
and do not suffer any uncreep thing to\
7:00\
come into it\
7:02\
that it be not defiled my glory\
7:06\
shall rest upon it yea\
7:09\
and my presence shall be there\
7:12\
for i will come into it and all the pure\
7:16\
in heart\
7:18\
that shall come into it shall see god\
7:22\
but if it be defiled i will not come\
7:25\
into it\
7:27\
and my glory shall not be there for i\
7:30\
will not\
7:31\
come into unholy temples\
7:34\
president russell m nelson made clear\
7:37\
for us\
7:39\
that we can see the savior in the temple\
7:42\
in the sense that he becomes no longer\
7:45\
unknown to us president nelson said this\
7:49\
open quote we understand him\
7:53\
we comprehend his work and his glory\
7:56\
and we begin to feel the infinite\
8:01\
impact of his matchless life\
8:04\
close quote if you or i\
8:08\
should go to the temple insufficiently\
8:11\
pure\
8:12\
we would not be able to see by the power\
8:15\
of the holy ghost\
8:17\
the spiritual teaching about the savior\
8:20\
that we can receive in the temple\
8:24\
when we are worthy to receive such\
8:26\
teaching\
8:27\
there can grow through our temple\
8:30\
experience\
8:31\
hope joy and optimism\
8:35\
throughout our lives that hope joy and\
8:38\
optimism are available\
8:40\
only through accepting the ordinances\
8:43\
performed in holy temples\
8:47\
it is that it is in the temple we can\
8:50\
receive the assurance\
8:52\
of loving family connections that will\
8:55\
continue\
8:56\
after death and last for eternity\
9:01\
years ago while i was serving as a\
9:04\
bishop\
9:06\
a handsome young man resisted my\
9:09\
invitation to become worthy\
9:11\
to live with god and families forever\
9:16\
in a belligerent way he told me of the\
9:17\
good times he had with his friends\
9:21\
i let him talk then\
9:26\
he told me about a moment during one of\
9:29\
his\
9:29\
parties in the midst of the raucous\
9:32\
noise\
9:34\
when he suddenly realized that he felt\
9:37\
lonely i asked him\
9:40\
what had happened he said\
9:44\
that he remembered a time\
9:47\
as a little boy sitting on his mother's\
9:50\
lap\
9:50\
with her arms around him for that moment\
9:54\
he\
9:54\
when he told that story he teared up\
9:57\
i said to him what i know is true\
10:00\
the only way you can have the feeling\
10:04\
of that family embrace forever\
10:07\
is to become worthy yourself and help\
10:10\
others\
10:11\
to receive the sealing ordinances of the\
10:14\
temple\
10:16\
now we don't know the details of family\
10:18\
connections in the spirit world\
10:21\
or what may come after we are\
10:22\
resurrected\
10:24\
but we do know that the prophet elijah\
10:27\
came\
10:28\
as promised to turn the hearts of the\
10:31\
fathers to the\
10:32\
children and the children to the fathers\
10:36\
and we know that our eternal happiness\
10:39\
depends on our doing our best\
10:42\
to offer the same lasting happiness\
10:45\
to as many of our kindred as we can\
10:50\
i feel the same desire to succeed in\
10:53\
inviting living family members members\
10:56\
to desire to become worthy to receive\
11:00\
and to honor the sealing ordinances of\
11:02\
the temple\
11:04\
that is part of the promised gathering\
11:06\
of israel\
11:08\
in the last days on both sides of the\
11:11\
veil\
11:13\
one of our greatest opportunities\
11:16\
is when our family members are young\
11:20\
they are born with a light of christ as\
11:22\
a gift\
11:24\
it enables them to sense what is good\
11:27\
and what is evil for that reason\
11:30\
even seeing a temple or a picture of a\
11:34\
temple\
11:36\
can cultivated a child the desire\
11:39\
to be worthy and privileged someday\
11:43\
to go inside they can then\
11:46\
come when as a youth they receive a\
11:49\
temple recommend to perform\
11:52\
proxy baptisms at the temple\
11:55\
in that experience their feeling could\
11:57\
grow\
11:59\
that the ordinances of the temple always\
12:02\
point\
12:02\
to the savior and his atonement\
12:07\
as they feel they are offering a person\
12:10\
in the spirit world the chance to be\
12:13\
cleansed of sin\
12:15\
their feeling will grow of helping the\
12:18\
savior\
12:19\
in his secret work his sacred work of\
12:22\
blessing a child\
12:24\
of our heavenly father i have seen the\
12:27\
power of that experience\
12:30\
change the life of a young person\
12:33\
years ago i went with a daughter\
12:36\
to a temple in the late afternoon\
12:41\
she was the last to serve as pros proxy\
12:43\
in the baptistry\
12:46\
my daughter was asked if she could stay\
12:48\
longer\
12:50\
to complete the ordinances for all of\
12:52\
the people\
12:53\
whose names were prepared she said\
12:56\
yes i watched as my little daughter\
13:00\
stepped into the baptismal font the\
13:03\
baptisms began my daughter had water\
13:07\
streaming down her face each time\
13:09\
she was lifted out of the water she was\
13:12\
asked again and again\
13:14\
can you do more each time\
13:17\
she said yes as a concerned father i\
13:21\
began to hope that she might be excused\
13:23\
from doing more but i remember still\
13:27\
her firmness when she was asked if she\
13:30\
could do more\
13:31\
and she said a determined little voice\
13:34\
yes she stayed until the last\
13:38\
person on the list that day had received\
13:41\
the blessing of baptism in the name of\
13:43\
jesus christ\
13:45\
when i walked out of the temple with her\
13:47\
that night\
13:48\
i wondered at what i had seen a\
13:52\
child had been lifted and changed\
13:55\
before my eyes by serving the lord\
13:58\
in his house i still remember\
14:02\
the feeling of light and peace as we\
14:04\
walked together from the temple\
14:07\
years have passed she is still saying\
14:10\
yes\
14:11\
to the question from the lord if she\
14:14\
will do more for him\
14:16\
when it is very hard that is what temple\
14:19\
service can do\
14:21\
to change and lift us\
14:24\
that is why i have a hope for you\
14:28\
and for all your beloved family is that\
14:30\
you will grow\
14:32\
in desire and determination to be worthy\
14:35\
to go into the house of the lord\
14:38\
as often as your circumstances allow\
14:41\
he wants to welcome you there\
14:45\
i pray that you will try to build desire\
14:48\
in the hearts of heavenly father's\
14:50\
children to go there\
14:52\
where they can feel close to him and\
14:55\
that you will also invite your ancestors\
14:58\
to qualify to be with him and with you\
15:02\
forever these words can be ours\
15:06\
i love to see the temple i'm going there\
15:09\
someday\
15:10\
to feel the holy spirit to listen and to\
15:13\
pray\
15:14\
for the temple is a house of god a place\
15:18\
of love and beauty i'll prepare myself\
15:21\
while i am young this is my sacred duty\
15:26\
i bear solemn testimony\
15:29\
that we are children of a loving\
15:31\
heavenly father\
15:34\
he chose his beloved son jesus christ\
15:38\
to be our savior and redeemer\
15:41\
the only way to return to live with them\
15:45\
and with our family is through the\
15:47\
ordinances\
15:48\
of the holy temple i testify\
15:52\
that president russell m nelson holds\
15:54\
and exercises all the keys\
15:57\
of the priesthood that make eternal life\
16:00\
possible\
16:01\
for all of god's children i so testify\
16:06\
in his sacred name of jesus christ\
16:20\
amen\
