In the general\
conference of The Church\
0:03\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints in October 1849,\
0:07\
Elder John Taylor of the\
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles\
0:11\
was called to open\
the nation of France\
0:14\
for the preaching of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
0:17\
His service included the editing\
of the first official Church\
0:22\
periodical in that country.\
0:24\
Elder Taylor prepared and\
published an article in 1851\
0:29\
in response to\
frequent questions\
0:32\
he had been asked\
about the Church.\
0:34\
And near the end of\
that essay, Elder Taylor\
0:37\
recalled the following episode:\
0:41\
"Some years ago, in Nauvoo,\
a gentleman in my hearing,\
0:45\
a member of the Legislature,\
asked Joseph Smith\
0:50\
how it was that he was enabled\
to govern so many people,\
0:53\
and to preserve\
such perfect order;\
0:57\
remarking at the same time\
that it was impossible for them\
1:01\
to do it anywhere else.\
1:03\
Mr. Smith remarked that it\
was very easy to do that.\
1:07\
'How?' responded the gentleman;\
'to us it is very difficult.'\
1:13\
Mr. Smith replied, 'I teach\
them correct principles,\
1:18\
and they govern themselves.'"\
1:23\
I pray that the Holy Ghost will\
instruct and edify each of us\
1:26\
as I emphasize\
the important role\
1:29\
of principles in the restored\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
1:35\
The Lord revealed to\
the Prophet Joseph Smith\
1:38\
that "the elders, priests\
and teachers of this church\
1:41\
shall teach the principles\
of my gospel, which\
1:45\
are in the Bible and\
the Book of Mormon,\
1:47\
in the which is the\
fulness of the gospel."\
1:51\
He also declared that\
Latter-day Saints\
1:54\
should "be instructed\
more perfectly\
1:57\
in theory, in\
principle, in doctrine,\
2:00\
in the law of the gospel,\
in all things that pertain\
2:04\
unto the kingdom of God,\
that are expedient for you\
2:08\
to understand."\
2:11\
Stated succinctly,\
a gospel principle\
2:14\
is a doctrinally based guideline\
for the righteous exercise\
2:19\
of moral agency.\
2:21\
Principles derive from\
broader gospel truths\
2:25\
and provide direction\
and standards\
2:28\
as we press forward\
on the covenant path.\
2:31\
For example, the first\
three articles of faith\
2:34\
identify fundamental aspects\
of the doctrine of the restored\
2:39\
gospel of Jesus\
Christ: the nature\
2:42\
of the Godhead in the\
first article of faith,\
2:45\
the effects of the\
Fall of Adam and Eve\
2:48\
in the second article of\
faith, and the blessings\
2:51\
made possible through the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ\
2:54\
in the third article of faith.\
2:57\
And the fourth article of\
faith sets forth the first\
3:01\
principles--the guidelines\
of exercising faith in Jesus\
3:05\
Christ and repenting--and the\
first priesthood ordinances\
3:10\
that enable the Atonement of\
Jesus Christ to be efficacious\
3:14\
in our lives.\
3:17\
The Word of Wisdom\
is another example\
3:19\
of a principle as a guideline.\
3:22\
Please note these\
introductory verses in section\
3:25\
89 of the Doctrine\
and Covenants:\
3:29\
"Given for a principle\
with promise,\
3:32\
adapted to the\
capacity of the weak\
3:34\
and the weakest\
of all saints, who\
3:37\
are or can be called saints.\
3:40\
"Behold, verily, thus\
saith the Lord unto you:\
3:43\
In consequence of\
evils and designs\
3:46\
which do and will exist in\
the hearts of conspiring\
3:49\
men in the last days, I have\
warned you, and forewarn you,\
3:55\
by giving unto you this word\
of wisdom by revelation."\
4:01\
The inspired instruction that\
follows this introduction\
4:04\
provides enduring guidelines\
for both physical and spiritual\
4:09\
well-being and testifies\
of specific blessings\
4:13\
contingent upon our\
faithfulness to the principle.\
4:19\
Learning, understanding,\
and living gospel principles\
4:23\
strengthen our\
faith in the Savior,\
4:26\
deepen our devotion\
to Him, and invite\
4:29\
a multitude of blessings and\
spiritual gifts into our lives.\
4:33\
Principles of\
righteousness also help\
4:36\
us to look beyond our\
personal preferences\
4:39\
and self-centered\
desires by providing\
4:43\
the precious perspective\
of eternal truth\
4:46\
as we navigate the different\
circumstances, challenges,\
4:50\
decisions, and\
experiences of mortality.\
4:55\
The statement by the\
Prophet Joseph Smith\
4:58\
about teaching\
correct principles\
5:00\
is perhaps one of his most\
frequently quoted teachings.\
5:04\
And we find powerful examples\
of this inspired pattern\
5:09\
of instruction in the\
pronouncements of the Lord's\
5:12\
authorized servants today.\
5:16\
President Dallin H. Oaks spoke\
in general conference in 1998\
5:21\
about Aaronic Priesthood\
holders' duties related\
5:24\
to preparing and\
administering the sacrament.\
5:28\
He described the principle\
of nondistraction\
5:32\
and indicated that a holder\
of the Aaronic Priesthood\
5:36\
would never want anything in\
his appearance or behavior\
5:41\
to distract any member of the\
Church from his or her worship\
5:45\
and renewal of covenants.\
5:48\
President Oaks also emphasized\
the related principles\
5:52\
of orderliness, cleanliness,\
reverence, and dignity.\
5:57\
Interestingly,\
President Oaks did not\
6:00\
provide for the young\
men a lengthy list\
6:03\
of things to do and not to do.\
6:05\
Rather, he explained\
the principle,\
6:08\
with the expectation that the\
young men and their parents\
6:12\
and teachers could and\
should use their own judgment\
6:16\
and inspiration to\
follow the guideline.\
6:19\
HE EXPLAINED: "I will not\
suggest detailed rules,\
6:25\
since the circumstances in\
various wards and branches\
6:28\
in our worldwide Church are so\
different that a specific rule\
6:32\
that seems required\
in one setting\
6:35\
may be inappropriate in another.\
6:37\
Rather, I will suggest\
a principle based\
6:41\
on the [doctrine.] If all\
understand this principle\
6:45\
and act in harmony with it,\
there should be little need\
6:48\
for rules.\
6:50\
If rules or counseling are\
needed in individual cases,\
6:54\
local leaders can provide them,\
consistent with the [doctrine]\
6:59\
and their related principles."\
7:04\
In the April 2015\
general conference,\
7:07\
President Russell M. Nelson\
taught that "the Sabbath\
7:11\
is a delight."\
7:13\
He also explained\
how he personally\
7:16\
had come to understand a\
basic principle about honoring\
7:20\
the Sabbath day:\
7:23\
"How do we hallow\
the Sabbath day?\
7:26\
In my much younger\
years, I studied the work\
7:29\
of others who had compiled\
lists of things to do and things\
7:33\
not to do on the Sabbath.\
7:35\
It wasn't until later that I\
learned from the scriptures\
7:39\
that my conduct and my\
attitude on the Sabbath\
7:42\
constituted a sign between\
me and my Heavenly Father.\
7:47\
With that understanding, I\
no longer needed lists of dos\
7:51\
and don'ts.\
7:52\
When I had to make a decision\
whether or not an activity was\
7:56\
appropriate for the Sabbath,\
I simply asked myself,\
8:00\
'What sign do I want\
to give to God?'\
8:04\
That question made my choices\
about the Sabbath day crystal\
8:09\
clear."\
8:13\
President Nelson's simple\
but powerful question\
8:16\
emphasizes a principle that\
cuts through any uncertainty\
8:20\
about what it means and what we\
should do to honor the Sabbath.\
8:25\
His question summarizes\
a guideline and standard\
8:29\
that can bless all of us in\
our varied circumstances.\
8:34\
Six months ago, in\
general conference,\
8:37\
President Nelson described\
his personal elation\
8:40\
as he was led to a new\
insight about the meaning\
8:44\
of the word "Israel."\
8:45\
He told us that his\
soul was stirred\
8:48\
as he learned that "the\
very name of Israel\
8:51\
refers to a person who is\
willing to let God prevail\
8:55\
in his or her life."\
8:57\
President Nelson then\
identified a number\
9:00\
of important implications\
that derive from this insight.\
9:06\
His message about being\
willing to let God prevail\
9:09\
is a remarkable example of\
teaching correct principles so\
9:14\
that we can govern ourselves.\
9:16\
And just as he\
did in his message\
9:18\
about making the\
Sabbath a delight,\
9:21\
President Nelson posed\
principle-based questions\
9:24\
that serve as guides and\
standards for each of us:\
9:28\
"Are you willing to let\
God prevail in your life?\
9:33\
Are you willing to let God be\
the most important influence\
9:38\
in your life?"\
9:41\
PRESIDENT NELSON CONTINUED:\
"Consider how such willingness\
9:45\
could bless you.\
9:46\
If you are unmarried and\
seeking an eternal companion,\
9:50\
your desire to be 'of\
Israel' will help you\
9:52\
decide whom to date and how.\
9:56\
"If you are married\
to a companion who\
9:58\
has broken his or her\
covenants, your willingness\
10:01\
to let God prevail in your\
life will allow your covenants\
10:05\
with God to remain intact.\
10:08\
The Savior will heal\
your broken heart.\
10:11\
The heavens will\
open as you seek\
10:13\
to know how to move forward.\
10:15\
You do not need to\
wander or wonder.\
10:19\
"If you have sincere questions\
about the gospel or the Church,\
10:23\
as you choose to\
let God prevail,\
10:26\
you will be led to\
find and understand\
10:28\
the absolute, eternal truths\
that will guide your life\
10:33\
and help you stay firmly\
on the covenant path.\
10:37\
"When you are faced\
with temptation--even\
10:39\
if the temptation comes when you\
are exhausted or feeling alone\
10:43\
or misunderstood--imagine the\
courage you can muster as you\
10:48\
choose to let God prevail in\
your life and as you plead with\
10:52\
Him to strengthen you.\
10:55\
"When your greatest\
desire is to let\
10:57\
God prevail, to\
be part of Israel,\
11:00\
so many decisions become easier.\
11:03\
So many issues become nonissues!\
11:07\
You know how best\
to groom yourself.\
11:10\
You know what to watch and\
read, where to spend your time,\
11:14\
and with whom to associate.\
11:16\
You know what you\
want to accomplish.\
11:18\
You know the kind of person\
you really want to become."\
11:25\
Notice how many crucial\
decisions and life experiences\
11:29\
can be influenced by\
the principle of being\
11:32\
willing to let God prevail:\
dating and marriage,\
11:36\
gospel questions and concerns,\
temptation, personal grooming,\
11:42\
what to watch and read,\
where to spend time,\
11:45\
with whom to associate,\
and many, many more.\
11:50\
President Nelson's inspired\
questions emphasize\
11:54\
a simple principle\
that provides direction\
11:57\
in every aspect of our lives and\
enables us to govern ourselves.\
12:05\
When Joseph Smith was\
imprisoned in Liberty Jail,\
12:07\
he wrote letters of instruction\
to Church members and leaders\
12:11\
and reminded them that "a\
very large ship is benefited\
12:17\
very much by a very small\
helm in the time of a storm,\
12:22\
by being kept workways with\
the wind and the waves."\
12:27\
A helm is a wheel or tiller\
and the associated equipment\
12:32\
used to steer a ship or a boat.\
12:35\
And "workways with the\
wind and the waves"\
12:39\
denotes turning a ship so\
that it maintains its balance\
12:43\
and does not capsize\
during a storm.\
12:47\
Gospel principles are for me and\
you what a helm is to a ship.\
12:53\
Correct principles\
enable us to find our way\
12:57\
and to stand firm, steadfast,\
and immovable so we do not\
13:02\
lose our balance and fall in\
the raging latter-day storms\
13:07\
of darkness and confusion.\
13:11\
We have been blessed abundantly\
in this general conference\
13:15\
to learn about\
eternal principles\
13:17\
from the Lord's\
authorized servants.\
13:20\
Now our individual\
responsibility\
13:24\
is to govern ourselves according\
to the truths of which they\
13:29\
have testified.\
13:31\
President Ezra\
Taft Benson taught,\
13:34\
"For the next six months,\
your conference edition\
13:39\
of the [Liahona] should stand\
next to your standard works\
13:43\
and be referred to frequently."\
13:48\
With all the energy of my\
soul, I invite all of us\
13:54\
to learn, live, and love\
principles of righteousness.\
13:59\
Only gospel truths can\
enable us to "cheerfully do\
14:04\
all things that\
lie in our power"\
14:06\
to press forward on\
the covenant path\
14:10\
and to "see the\
salvation of God,\
14:12\
and for his arm to be revealed."\
14:16\
I know that the\
doctrine and principles\
14:19\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ\
are the foundational sources\
14:23\
of direction for our lives and\
of enduring joy in mortality\
14:29\
and eternity.\
14:30\
And on this glorious\
Easter Sunday\
14:34\
I joyfully witness that our\
living Savior is the fount\
14:39\
from which these truths flow.\
14:42\
I so testify and witness\
in the sacred name\
14:46\
of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
