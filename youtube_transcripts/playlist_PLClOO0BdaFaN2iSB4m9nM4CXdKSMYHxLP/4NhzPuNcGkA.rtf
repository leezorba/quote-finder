Several years ago while\
attending meetings\
0:03\
in Salt Lake City, I was greeted\
by our dear prophet, Russell M.\
0:08\
Nelson.\
0:09\
In his typically\
warm and personal way\
0:13\
he asked, "Mark, how\
is your mum doing?"\
0:18\
I told him I had been with her\
earlier that week at her home\
0:22\
in New Zealand and that\
she was getting old\
0:25\
but was full of faith\
and an inspiration\
0:27\
to all who knew her.\
0:29\
He then said, "Please\
give her my love, ...\
0:33\
and tell her I look forward\
to seeing her again."\
0:37\
I was rather surprised\
and asked, "Do you\
0:40\
have a trip planned\
to New Zealand soon?"\
0:43\
With thoughtful sincerity\
he replied, "Oh, no.\
0:49\
I will see her in\
the next life."\
0:52\
There was nothing\
frivolous in his response.\
0:55\
It was a perfectly natural\
expression of fact.\
0:59\
In that private,\
unguarded moment,\
1:02\
I heard and felt pure\
testimony from a living prophet\
1:05\
that life continues after death.\
1:09\
This conference\
weekend, you will\
1:11\
hear living apostles\
and prophets\
1:13\
testify of the Resurrection\
of Jesus Christ.\
1:16\
"The fundamental principles of\
our religion are the testimony\
1:20\
of the Apostles and Prophets,\
concerning Jesus Christ,\
1:23\
that He died, was buried, and\
rose again the third day ... ;\
1:28\
all other things which pertain\
to our religion are only\
1:31\
appendages to [this truth]."\
1:34\
I promise that as you\
listen with real intent,\
1:38\
the Spirit will confirm in\
your mind and your heart\
1:41\
the truth of these testimonies.\
1:44\
Jesus's ancient\
Apostles were forever\
1:47\
changed after He appeared\
to them following His death.\
1:50\
Ten of them saw for themselves\
that He had been resurrected.\
1:54\
Thomas, being initially\
absent, declared,\
1:58\
"Except I shall see ...\
2:00\
I will not believe."\
2:03\
Later Jesus admonished Thomas,\
saying, "Be not faithless,\
2:08\
but believing."\
2:10\
Then the Lord taught\
the vital role of faith:\
2:13\
"Blessed are they that have not\
seen, and yet have believed."\
2:19\
The resurrected Lord\
gave His Apostles\
2:21\
the charge to testify of Him.\
2:23\
As with our living\
Apostles today, they\
2:26\
left behind worldly\
occupations and spent\
2:29\
the rest of their lives\
boldly declaring that God\
2:32\
had raised up this Jesus.\
2:34\
Their powerful testimonies\
led to thousands accepting\
2:38\
the invitation to be baptized.\
2:41\
The glorious message\
of Easter morning\
2:45\
is central to all Christianity.\
2:48\
Jesus Christ has risen from\
the dead, and because of this,\
2:52\
we too will live\
again after we die.\
2:55\
This knowledge gives meaning\
and purpose to our lives.\
3:00\
If we go forward in faith,\
we will be forever changed,\
3:04\
as were the Apostles of old.\
3:06\
We, like them, will be able to\
endure any hardship with faith\
3:11\
in Jesus Christ.\
3:13\
This faith also gives us hope\
for a time when our "sorrow\
3:18\
shall be turned into joy."\
3:22\
My own faith had its beginnings\
following a time of sorrow.\
3:27\
My father and mother were\
sheep farmers in New Zealand.\
3:31\
They enjoyed their life.\
3:34\
As a young married\
couple, they were blessed\
3:37\
with three little girls.\
3:39\
The youngest of\
these was named Ann.\
3:43\
One day while they were on\
holiday together at a lake,\
3:47\
17-month-old Ann toddled off.\
3:51\
After minutes of\
desperate searching,\
3:54\
she was found\
lifeless in the water.\
3:58\
This nightmare caused\
unspeakable sorrow.\
4:03\
Dad wrote years later\
that some of the laughter\
4:06\
went out of their lives forever.\
4:08\
It also caused a\
yearning for answers\
4:12\
to life's most\
important questions:\
4:15\
"What will become\
of our precious Ann?\
4:18\
Will we ever see her again?\
4:21\
How can our family\
ever be happy again?"\
4:27\
Some years after this tragedy,\
two young missionaries\
4:31\
from The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
4:34\
came to our farm.\
4:35\
They began teaching the truths\
found in the Book of Mormon\
4:39\
and the Bible.\
4:41\
These truths include\
the assurance\
4:43\
that Ann now lives\
in the spirit world.\
4:46\
Because of the Resurrection\
of Jesus Christ,\
4:49\
she too will be resurrected.\
4:53\
They taught that the\
Church of Jesus Christ\
4:55\
has once again been restored\
on earth with a living\
4:57\
prophet and twelve Apostles.\
5:00\
And they taught the unique\
and remarkable doctrine\
5:05\
that families can be\
bound together forever\
5:07\
by the same priesthood\
authority Jesus Christ gave\
5:11\
His chief Apostle, Peter.\
5:14\
Mum instantly recognized\
truth and received\
5:17\
a witness of the Spirit.\
5:19\
Dad, however, wrestled for\
the next year between doubts\
5:24\
and spiritual nudges.\
5:26\
Also, he was reluctant to\
change his way of life.\
5:31\
One morning following\
a sleepless night,\
5:33\
while pacing the floor,\
he turned to Mum and said,\
5:36\
"I will be baptized\
today or never."\
5:42\
Mum told the missionaries\
what had happened,\
5:44\
and they immediately\
recognized the flicker of faith\
5:47\
in my father that would now\
be either lit or extinguished.\
5:51\
That very morning our family\
traveled to the nearest beach.\
5:57\
Unaware of what was\
happening, we children\
6:01\
had a picnic on the sand\
dunes while Elders Boyd Green\
6:04\
and Gary Sheffield led\
my parents into the ocean\
6:07\
and baptized them.\
6:09\
In a further act of faith, Dad\
privately committed to the Lord\
6:14\
that come what may, he\
would be true all his life\
6:18\
to the promises he was making.\
6:21\
One year later a\
temple was dedicated\
6:24\
in Hamilton, New Zealand.\
6:25\
Shortly thereafter, our family,\
with someone representing Ann,\
6:29\
knelt around the altar in\
that sacred house of the Lord.\
6:33\
There, by the authority\
of the priesthood,\
6:36\
we were united as\
an eternal family\
6:39\
in a simple and\
beautiful ordinance.\
6:42\
This brought great\
peace and joy.\
6:47\
Many years later Dad\
told me that if not\
6:49\
for Ann's tragic death,\
he would never have been\
6:52\
humble enough to accept\
the restored gospel.\
6:55\
Yet the Spirit of\
the Lord instilled\
6:58\
hope that what the\
missionaries taught was true.\
7:01\
This led to my parents' faith\
growing until they each burned\
7:05\
with the fire of\
testimony that quietly\
7:08\
and humbly guided their\
every decision in life.\
7:13\
I will always be thankful\
for my parents' example\
7:16\
to future generations.\
7:17\
It is impossible to measure the\
number of lives forever changed\
7:22\
because of their acts of faith\
in response to profound sorrow.\
7:29\
I invite all who\
feel sorrow, all\
7:32\
who wrestle with\
doubt, all who wonder\
7:35\
what happens after we die to\
place your faith in Christ.\
7:41\
I promise that if you desire\
to believe, then act in faith,\
7:47\
and follow the\
whisperings of the Spirit,\
7:50\
you will find joy in this\
life and in the world to come.\
7:56\
How I look forward to the day\
I will meet my sister Ann.\
7:59\
I look forward to\
a joyful reunion\
8:02\
with my father, who\
died over 30 years ago.\
8:06\
I testify of the joy to be\
found in living by faith,\
8:10\
believing without\
seeing but knowing\
8:12\
by the power of the Holy\
Ghost that Jesus Christ lives.\
8:16\
With all my heart\
and soul, I choose\
8:21\
to follow Jesus Christ\
and His restored gospel.\
8:24\
This blesses every\
aspect of my life.\
8:30\
I know that Jesus is the\
Christ, the Son of God,\
8:33\
our Savior, and our Redeemer.\
8:37\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
