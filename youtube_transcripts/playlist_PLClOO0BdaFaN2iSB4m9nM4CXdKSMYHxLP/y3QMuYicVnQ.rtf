My dear brothers and sisters,\
on this radiant Easter morning,\
0:11\
my heart rejoices upon\
remembering the most marvelous,\
0:16\
the most majestic, the most\
immeasurable act that has\
0:20\
occurred in all of human\
history--the atoning sacrifice\
0:25\
of our Lord, Jesus Christ.\
0:28\
The eminent words of\
the prophet Isaiah\
0:31\
magnify the greatness and\
selflessness of the Savior's\
0:34\
condescension and\
sacrifice in behalf\
0:38\
of all the children\
of God, and I quote:\
0:41\
"Surely he hath\
borne our griefs,\
0:44\
and carried our sorrows: yet\
we did esteem him stricken,\
0:50\
smitten of God, and afflicted.\
0:52\
But he was wounded for\
our transgressions,\
0:56\
he was bruised for\
our iniquities:\
0:58\
the chastisement of\
our peace was upon him;\
1:01\
and with his stripes\
we are healed."\
1:06\
By voluntarily\
taking upon Himself\
1:08\
the sins of all mankind, being\
cruelly nailed to the cross,\
1:13\
and victoriously conquering\
death on the third day,\
1:16\
Jesus gave a more\
sacred significance\
1:19\
to the Passover ordinance\
that had been bestowed\
1:23\
upon Israel in ancient times.\
1:25\
In fulfillment of prophecy,\
He offered His own body\
1:29\
and precious blood as the\
great and last sacrifice,\
1:34\
validating the traditional\
symbols used in the celebration\
1:37\
of the Lord's Passover.\
1:39\
In doing so, Christ experienced\
physical and spiritual\
1:44\
suffering that is\
incomprehensible\
1:46\
to the human mind.\
1:50\
THE SAVIOR HIMSELF SAID:\
"For behold, I, God,\
1:53\
have suffered these\
things for all, ...\
1:56\
Which suffering caused myself,\
even God, the greatest of all,\
2:01\
to tremble because of pain,\
and to bleed at every pore,\
2:06\
and to suffer both body and\
spirit--and would that I might\
2:11\
not drink the bitter cup,\
and shrink--Nevertheless,\
2:15\
glory be to the Father,\
and I partook and finished\
2:19\
my preparations unto\
the children of men."\
2:25\
Christ graciously fulfilled\
the will of the Father\
2:28\
through His infinite\
and merciful sacrifice.\
2:31\
He overcame the sting of\
physical and spiritual death\
2:34\
introduced to the\
world through the Fall,\
2:37\
offering us the\
glorious possibility\
2:40\
of eternal salvation.\
2:42\
Jesus was the only being\
capable of realizing\
2:46\
this eternal and perfect\
sacrifice for all of us.\
2:49\
He was chosen and foreordained\
in the Grand Council\
2:54\
in heaven even before\
the world was formed.\
2:58\
Furthermore, being born\
of a mortal mother,\
3:01\
He inherited the physical\
death; but from God,\
3:05\
as the Only Begotten\
Son of the Father,\
3:08\
He inherited the power\
to lay down His own life\
3:11\
and then to take it up again.\
3:15\
Additionally, Christ\
lived a perfect life\
3:18\
that was without\
blemish and therefore\
3:21\
was exempt from the\
demands of divine justice.\
3:25\
On one occasion, the\
Prophet Joseph Smith taught,\
3:28\
and I quote: "Salvation\
could not come to the world\
3:32\
without the mediation\
of Jesus Christ.\
3:35\
God ... prepared a sacrifice\
in the gift of His own Son,\
3:39\
who should be sent\
in due time to ...\
3:42\
open a door through\
which man might enter\
3:45\
into the Lord's presence."\
3:49\
While through His sacrifice\
the Savior unconditionally\
3:52\
removed the effects\
of physical death,\
3:56\
He did not eliminate our\
personal responsibility\
3:59\
to repent for the\
sins we commit.\
4:01\
Rather, He extended to\
us a loving invitation\
4:06\
to be reconciled to\
our Eternal Father.\
4:10\
Through Jesus Christ and\
His atoning sacrifice,\
4:13\
we can experience a mighty\
change of mind and heart,\
4:17\
bringing a fresh\
attitude both toward God\
4:21\
and toward life in general.\
4:23\
When we sincerely\
repent of our sins\
4:27\
and turn our hearts and will\
to God and His commandments,\
4:31\
we can receive His\
forgiveness and feel\
4:34\
the influence of His Holy\
Spirit in greater abundance.\
4:38\
Mercifully, we avoid\
having to experience\
4:43\
the depth of the suffering\
the Savior endured.\
4:47\
The gift of repentance\
is an expression\
4:50\
of God's kindness\
toward His children,\
4:52\
and it is a demonstration\
of His incomparable power\
4:56\
to help us overcome\
the sins we commit.\
4:59\
It is also an evidence\
of the patience\
5:02\
and longsuffering\
our loving Father\
5:05\
has for our mortal\
weakness and frailties.\
5:08\
President Russell M.\
Nelson, our beloved prophet,\
5:12\
referred to this gift as "the\
key to happiness and peace\
5:16\
of mind."\
5:18\
My dear friends,\
I testify to you\
5:21\
that as we genuinely\
repent of our sins,\
5:25\
we allow the atoning\
sacrifice of Christ\
5:28\
to become wholly\
effective in our life.\
5:31\
We will become free\
from the bondage of sin,\
5:34\
find joy in our earthly\
journey, and become\
5:38\
eligible to receive eternal\
salvation, which was prepared\
5:42\
from the foundation of the world\
for all who believe in Jesus\
5:46\
Christ and come unto Him.\
5:49\
In addition to the\
majestic gift of salvation,\
5:53\
the Savior offers us\
relief and comfort\
5:56\
as we face our afflictions,\
temptations, and weaknesses\
6:00\
of mortal life, including\
the circumstances\
6:03\
we have experienced recently\
in the current pandemic.\
6:07\
I can assure you that Christ is\
ever aware of the adversities\
6:12\
and experiences in mortality.\
6:14\
He understands all of\
the bitterness, agony,\
6:18\
and physical pain as well as\
the emotional and spiritual\
6:22\
challenges we face.\
6:24\
The Savior's bowels\
are filled with mercy,\
6:27\
and He is always\
ready to succor us.\
6:30\
This is possible\
because He personally\
6:33\
experienced and took\
upon Himself in the flesh\
6:36\
the pain of our weakness\
and infirmities.\
6:40\
With meekness and\
humility of heart,\
6:43\
He descended below all things\
and accepted being despised,\
6:48\
rejected, and humiliated\
by men, having\
6:52\
been wounded for our\
transgressions and iniquities.\
6:56\
He suffered these\
things for all,\
6:58\
taking upon Himself\
the sins of the world,\
7:01\
thus becoming our ultimate\
spiritual caregiver.\
7:05\
As we draw nearer to Him,\
surrendering ourselves\
7:09\
spiritually to His\
care, we will be\
7:12\
able to take upon ourselves\
His yoke, which is easy,\
7:16\
and His burden, which\
is light, thus finding\
7:19\
that promised comfort and rest.\
7:22\
Furthermore, we will\
receive the strength\
7:26\
we all need to overcome\
the hardships, weaknesses,\
7:30\
and sorrows of life, which are\
exceedingly difficult to endure\
7:34\
without His help\
and healing power.\
7:38\
The scriptures teach us to\
"Cast thy burden upon the Lord,\
7:42\
and he shall sustain thee.\
7:44\
And then may God grant [us]\
that [our] burdens may be light,\
7:49\
through the joy of [His] Son."\
7:52\
Near the end of\
last year, I learned\
7:55\
of the passing of a dear couple,\
Mario and Regina Emerick,\
8:01\
who were very\
faithful to the Lord\
8:04\
and passed away four\
days apart from one\
8:07\
another due to\
complications from COVID-19.\
8:11\
One of their sons,\
who is currently\
8:13\
serving as a bishop in Brazil,\
8:16\
related the following\
to me, and I quote:\
8:19\
"It was so difficult to\
see my parents depart\
8:22\
from this world\
in that condition,\
8:24\
but I could clearly feel the\
hand of the Lord in my life\
8:28\
amidst that tragedy,\
because I received\
8:32\
strength and peace that\
transcended my understanding.\
8:36\
Through my faith in Jesus\
Christ and His Atonement,\
8:39\
I received divine help\
to strengthen and comfort\
8:43\
my family members and all\
those who helped us during this\
8:47\
trying experience.\
8:49\
Even though the miracle\
that everyone hoped for\
8:52\
did not occur, personally I am\
a witness of many other miracles\
8:58\
that have occurred\
in my own life\
9:02\
and in the lives of\
my family members.\
9:04\
I felt an inexplicable\
peace that\
9:08\
penetrated the\
depths of my heart,\
9:11\
giving me hope and confidence\
in the love of the Savior for me\
9:15\
and in the plan of happiness\
of God for His children.\
9:19\
I learned that on the very\
most grief-filled days,\
9:23\
the loving arms of\
the Savior are always\
9:27\
extended when we seek Him with\
all our heart, power, mind,\
9:33\
and strength."\
9:37\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
on this Easter Sunday,\
9:41\
I bear my solemn witness\
that Jesus rose from the dead\
9:46\
and that He lives.\
9:48\
I testify to you that through\
Him and His infinite Atonement,\
9:55\
the Savior provided us\
the way to overcome death,\
9:59\
both physically and spiritually.\
10:02\
In addition to these\
great blessings,\
10:06\
He also offers us comfort and\
assurance in difficult times.\
10:12\
I assure you that as we put\
our trust in Jesus Christ\
10:16\
and in His supernal\
atoning sacrifice,\
10:20\
enduring in our\
faith to the end,\
10:23\
we will enjoy the promises of\
our Beloved Heavenly Father,\
10:27\
who does everything within\
His power to help us\
10:32\
return to His presence one day.\
10:36\
This is His work and His glory!\
10:38\
I testify to you that Jesus\
is the Christ, the Redeemer\
10:43\
of the world, the promised\
Messiah, the Resurrection\
10:48\
and the Life.\
10:49\
And I share these\
truths with you\
10:51\
in His holy name, the Only\
Begotten of the Father,\
10:55\
our Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
