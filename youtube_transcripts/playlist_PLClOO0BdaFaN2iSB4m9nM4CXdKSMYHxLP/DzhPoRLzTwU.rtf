In 1978, I stood\
on a football field\
0:04\
in a stadium packed\
with 65,000 fans.\
0:07\
In front of me were several\
very large opponents\
0:09\
who looked like they\
wanted to take my head off.\
0:12\
It was my first game as\
a starting quarterback\
0:15\
in the National\
Football League, and we\
0:17\
were playing the reigning\
Super Bowl champions.\
0:20\
To be honest, I questioned\
whether I was good enough\
0:22\
to be on the field.\
0:24\
I dropped back to\
throw my first pass,\
0:26\
and as I released the\
ball, I was hit harder\
0:28\
than I'd ever been hit before.\
0:30\
At that moment, lying under a\
pile of those massive athletes,\
0:34\
I wondered what I\
was doing there.\
0:36\
I had a decision to make.\
0:38\
Would I let my\
doubts overtake me,\
0:41\
or would I find\
courage and strength\
0:43\
to get up and carry on?\
0:46\
I didn't realize at the time how\
this experience would prepare\
0:49\
me for future opportunities.\
0:52\
I needed to learn\
that I could be\
0:53\
strong and courageous in the\
face of difficult situations.\
0:58\
A football game might not\
be nearly as important\
1:02\
as the challenges you will face.\
1:04\
In most cases, there\
won't be a stadium\
1:06\
full of people watching.\
1:08\
But your valiant decisions\
will have eternal significance.\
1:14\
Maybe we don't always\
feel up to the challenge.\
1:17\
But our Heavenly Father\
sees us as fearless builders\
1:20\
of His kingdom.\
1:21\
That is why He sent us here\
during this most decisive time\
1:26\
in the world's history.\
1:27\
This is our time!\
1:31\
Listen to what President\
Russell M. Nelson said shortly\
1:34\
after becoming\
President of the Church:\
1:36\
"Our Savior and\
Redeemer, Jesus Christ,\
1:40\
will perform some of His\
mightiest works between now\
1:43\
and when He comes again.\
1:44\
We will see\
miraculous indications\
1:47\
that God the Father and\
His Son, Jesus Christ,\
1:50\
preside over this Church\
in majesty and glory."\
1:55\
Mightiest works?\
1:56\
Miraculous indications?\
1:59\
What will that look like?\
2:01\
What role will we play, and how\
will we understand what to do?\
2:05\
I don't know all\
the answers, but I\
2:07\
do know that the Lord\
needs us to be ready!\
2:10\
Worthily exercising\
priesthood power\
2:12\
has never been more crucial.\
2:15\
Do we believe God's prophet?\
2:17\
Can we find and\
fulfill our destiny?\
2:19\
Yes, we can, and yes, we must,\
because this is our time!\
2:26\
When we hear stories of God's\
mighty servants who came before\
2:29\
us--like Moses, Mary,\
Moroni, Alma, Esther, Joseph,\
2:33\
and many others--they\
seem bigger than life.\
2:37\
But they were not that\
different from us.\
2:39\
They were regular people\
who faced challenges.\
2:42\
They trusted the Lord.\
2:43\
They made the right\
choices at pivotal moments.\
2:47\
And, with faith in\
Jesus Christ, they\
2:49\
performed the works\
required in their time.\
2:52\
Consider the Old\
Testament hero Joshua.\
2:55\
He was a devoted follower of\
Moses, one of the greatest\
2:58\
leaders in history.\
3:00\
After Moses departed,\
it was Joshua's time.\
3:03\
He was to lead the children of\
Israel into the promised land.\
3:07\
How would he do that?\
3:09\
Joshua had been born and\
raised in slavery in Egypt.\
3:13\
He had no handbook or\
instructional videos\
3:15\
to help him.\
3:16\
He didn't even\
have a smartphone!\
3:19\
But he did have this\
promise from the Lord:\
3:23\
"As I was with Moses,\
so I will be with thee:\
3:27\
I will not fail thee,\
nor forsake thee.\
3:30\
Be strong and of\
a good courage."\
3:34\
When I was a new and\
inexperienced Seventy,\
3:36\
I received an urgent phone call\
from the office of the First\
3:39\
Presidency, asking if I\
would represent the prophet\
3:43\
in visiting a young man in\
the hospital--immediately.\
3:46\
The young man's name was Zach.\
3:49\
He was preparing\
to be a missionary\
3:51\
but had been in an accident and\
suffered a serious head injury.\
3:56\
As I drove to the\
hospital, my mind raced.\
3:58\
An errand for the\
prophet--are you kidding?\
4:01\
What am I going to face?\
4:03\
How will I help this young man?\
4:05\
Do I have enough faith?\
4:07\
Fervent prayer and\
the knowledge that I\
4:09\
possessed the authority\
of the holy priesthood\
4:11\
became my anchors.\
4:14\
When I arrived, Zach was\
lying in a hospital bed.\
4:17\
An orderly stood ready to\
whisk him to the operating room\
4:20\
so doctors could relieve\
the pressure on his brain.\
4:23\
I looked at his tearful mom and\
a fearful young friend standing\
4:27\
nearby, and I knew\
clearly that Zach\
4:31\
needed a priesthood blessing.\
4:32\
His friend had recently received\
the Melchizedek Priesthood,\
4:36\
so I asked him to help me.\
4:38\
I felt the power\
of the priesthood\
4:40\
as we humbly gave\
Zach a blessing.\
4:42\
Then he was hurried\
away for the surgery,\
4:44\
and a peaceful feeling confirmed\
that the Savior would handle\
4:48\
things according to His wisdom.\
4:51\
The medical staff\
performed one last X-ray\
4:53\
before making the\
initial incision.\
4:56\
They discovered, to\
their astonishment,\
4:58\
that no operation\
would be needed.\
5:03\
After much therapy, Zach\
learned to walk and talk again.\
5:07\
He served a successful\
mission and is now\
5:10\
raising a beautiful family.\
5:12\
Of course, that is not\
always the outcome.\
5:14\
I have given other priesthood\
blessings with equal faith,\
5:17\
and the Lord did not grant\
complete healing in this life.\
5:20\
We trust His purposes and\
leave the results to Him.\
5:25\
We can't always choose the\
outcome of our actions,\
5:28\
but we can choose\
to be ready to act.\
5:32\
You might not ever\
be asked to represent\
5:35\
the First Presidency in a\
life-threatening situation.\
5:40\
But we are all called upon\
to do life-changing things\
5:44\
as representatives of the Lord.\
5:46\
He will not forsake us.\
5:49\
This is our time!\
5:52\
Peter, the Savior's\
chief Apostle,\
5:53\
was in a ship on the sea when he\
saw Jesus walking on the water.\
5:58\
He wanted to join Him, and\
the Savior said, "Come."\
6:01\
Courageously, and\
miraculously, Peter\
6:04\
left the safety of\
the boat and began\
6:05\
walking toward the Savior.\
6:08\
But when Peter focused\
on the boisterous wind,\
6:11\
his faith faltered.\
6:12\
"He was afraid; and\
beginning to sink,\
6:15\
he cried, saying, Lord, save me.\
6:18\
And immediately Jesus\
stretched forth his hand,\
6:21\
and caught him."\
6:23\
When winds blow in our\
lives, where is our focus?\
6:26\
Remember, there is always\
one reliable source\
6:31\
of strength and courage.\
6:32\
The arms of Jesus extend to us,\
just as they extended to Peter.\
6:36\
As we reach for Him, He\
will lovingly rescue us.\
6:41\
We are His.\
6:42\
He said, "Fear not: for\
I have redeemed thee,\
6:47\
I have called thee by\
thy name; thou art mine."\
6:51\
He will prevail in your\
life if you let Him.\
6:54\
The choice is yours.\
6:57\
At the end of his life, Joshua\
pleaded with his people,\
6:59\
"Choose you this day\
whom ye will serve;\
7:02\
but as for me and my house,\
we will serve the Lord."\
7:06\
Because of the choices he\
made to serve the Lord,\
7:09\
Joshua became a great\
leader in his time.\
7:11\
My dear friends,\
this is our time!\
7:15\
And our choices will\
determine our destiny.\
7:20\
While I was serving as a bishop,\
we had a motto in our ward:\
7:23\
"Good choices equal\
happiness--eternally."\
7:26\
The youth would pass me in\
the hall saying, "Bishop,\
7:29\
I'm making good choices!"\
7:30\
That's a bishop's dream!\
7:33\
What do we mean\
by "good choices"?\
7:35\
Someone once asked Jesus,\
"Which is the great commandment\
7:39\
in the law?"\
7:40\
He answered: "Thou shalt\
love the Lord thy God\
7:43\
with all thy heart,\
and with all thy soul,\
7:45\
and with all thy mind.\
7:47\
This is the first and\
great commandment.\
7:49\
And the second is like unto it,\
Thou shalt love thy neighbour\
7:54\
as thyself."\
7:57\
I don't know about you,\
but when I read these two\
8:00\
great commandments, I detect\
a third, implied commandment:\
8:03\
to love thyself.\
8:06\
Have you ever thought of loving\
yourself as a commandment?\
8:09\
Can we truly love God\
and love His children\
8:13\
if we don't love ourselves?\
8:16\
A wise leader recently\
counseled a man\
8:18\
who was trying to overcome\
years of destructive choices.\
8:22\
The man felt ashamed\
doubting that he\
8:24\
was worthy of anyone's love.\
8:26\
His leader said\
to him, "The Lord\
8:28\
knows you, loves you,\
and is pleased [with] you\
8:32\
and the courageous\
steps you are taking."\
8:34\
But then he added, "[You] need\
to hear the commandment to love\
8:38\
yourself so you can feel\
[God's] love and love others."\
8:42\
When this brother\
heard that counsel,\
8:43\
he saw life with new eyes.\
8:45\
He later said, "I have\
spent my whole life trying\
8:48\
to find peace and acceptance.\
8:51\
I have looked for those\
things in many wrong places.\
8:55\
Only in the love of Heavenly\
Father and the Savior can\
8:58\
I find comfort.\
8:59\
I know They want\
me to love myself;\
9:02\
it really is the only way I\
can feel Their love for me."\
9:08\
Our Heavenly Father wants us to\
love ourselves--not to become\
9:12\
prideful or self-centered but\
to see ourselves as He sees us.\
9:17\
We are His cherished children.\
9:20\
When this truth sinks deep into\
our hearts, our love for God\
9:24\
grows.\
9:25\
When we view ourselves\
with sincere respect,\
9:28\
our hearts are open to\
treat others that way too.\
9:32\
The more we recognize\
our divine worth,\
9:35\
the better we understand\
this divine truth:\
9:37\
that God has sent us right here,\
right now, at this momentous\
9:42\
time in history, so that we can\
do the greatest possible good\
9:46\
with the talents\
and gifts we have.\
9:48\
This is our time!\
9:52\
Joseph Smith taught that\
every prophet, in every age,\
9:56\
"looked forward with joyful\
anticipation to the day\
10:00\
in which we live; ... they have\
sung and written and prophesied\
10:03\
of this our day; ... we are\
the favored people that God has\
10:07\
[chosen] to bring about\
the Latter-day glory."\
10:11\
As you face your\
daily challenges,\
10:12\
remember this reassurance\
offered by Elder Jeffrey R.\
10:15\
Holland: "So much\
rests on our shoulders,\
10:18\
but it will be a glorious and\
successful experience. ...\
10:21\
The victory in\
this final contest\
10:23\
has already been declared.\
10:25\
The victory is already\
in the record books ...\
10:28\
the scriptures!"\
10:32\
May I extend an\
invitation that we all\
10:35\
pray to recognize and\
embrace our individual roles\
10:39\
as we prepare for\
the glorious day\
10:41\
when the Savior comes again.\
10:43\
The Lord loves us more\
than we can comprehend,\
10:47\
and He will answer our prayers!\
10:49\
Whether we are on a football\
field, in a hospital room,\
10:52\
or in any other place, we can\
be an important part of these\
10:56\
remarkable events--because\
this is our time!\
11:00\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
