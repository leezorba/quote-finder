have you ever wondered why we call\
0:03\
primary primary while the name refers to\
0:06\
spiritual learning children receive in\
0:08\
their earliest years\
0:10\
to me it is also a reminder of a\
0:12\
powerful truth\
0:14\
to our heavenly father children have\
0:16\
never been\
0:17\
secondary they have always been primary\
0:21\
he trusts us to value respect and\
0:25\
protect them\
0:26\
as children of god that means we\
0:29\
never harm them physically verbally or\
0:32\
emotionally in any way even when\
0:35\
tensions\
0:36\
and pressures run high instead we\
0:39\
value children and we do all we can to\
0:42\
combat the evils of abuse\
0:45\
their care is primary to us as it is to\
0:48\
him\
0:50\
one young mother and father sat at their\
0:52\
kitchen table reviewing their day\
0:55\
from down the hall they heard a thud the\
0:57\
mother\
0:58\
asked what was that then they heard a\
1:01\
soft cry coming from their four-year-old\
1:03\
son's bedroom\
1:04\
they rushed down the hall there he was\
1:07\
lying on the floor next to his bed\
1:10\
the mother picked up the little boy and\
1:12\
asked him what had happened\
1:14\
he said i fell out of bed she said\
1:17\
why did you fall out of bed he shrugged\
1:20\
and said\
1:21\
i don't know i guess i just didn't get\
1:23\
far enough in\
1:25\
it is about this getting far enough in\
1:28\
that i would like to speak this morning\
1:31\
it is our privilege and responsibility\
1:34\
to help children get far enough into the\
1:37\
gospel of jesus christ\
1:39\
and we cannot begin too soon\
1:42\
there is a uniquely special time in\
1:44\
children's lives when they are protected\
1:46\
from satan's influence\
1:48\
it is a time when they are innocent and\
1:51\
sin free\
1:52\
it is a sacred time for parent and child\
1:56\
children are to be taught by word and\
1:59\
example\
2:00\
before and after they have arrived unto\
2:03\
the years of accountability before god\
2:06\
president henry b eyring taught quote\
2:10\
we have the greatest opportunity with\
2:12\
the young\
2:13\
the best time to teach is early while\
2:16\
children\
2:16\
are still immune to the temptations of\
2:18\
the mortal enemy\
2:20\
and long before the words of truth may\
2:22\
be harder for them to hear\
2:24\
in the noise of their personal struggles\
2:27\
close quote\
2:29\
such teaching will help them realize\
2:32\
their divine identity\
2:33\
their purpose and the rich blessings\
2:36\
that await them\
2:37\
as they make sacred covenants and\
2:39\
receive ordinances\
2:40\
along the covenant path we cannot wait\
2:44\
for conversion to simply happen to our\
2:46\
children\
2:48\
accidental conversion is not a principle\
2:50\
of the gospel of jesus christ\
2:53\
becoming like our savior will not happen\
2:55\
randomly\
2:57\
being intentional in loving teaching\
3:00\
and testifying can help children begin\
3:03\
at a young\
3:04\
age to feel the influence of the holy\
3:06\
ghost\
3:07\
the holy ghost is essential to our\
3:10\
children's testimony of and conversion\
3:13\
to\
3:13\
jesus christ we desire them to always\
3:16\
remember him\
3:18\
that they may have his spirit to be with\
3:20\
them\
3:22\
consider the value of family\
3:24\
conversations\
3:25\
about the gospel of jesus christ\
3:27\
essential conversations\
3:30\
that can invite the spirit when we have\
3:32\
such conversations with our children we\
3:35\
help them create a foundation\
3:37\
which is a sure foundation a foundation\
3:40\
where on if they build they cannot fall\
3:44\
when we strengthen a child we strengthen\
3:47\
the family\
3:49\
these vital discussions can lead\
3:51\
children to understand the doctrine of\
3:53\
repentance\
3:54\
have faith in christ the son of the\
3:56\
living god\
3:58\
choose baptism and the gift of the holy\
4:00\
ghost when eight years old\
4:02\
and pray and walk uprightly before the\
4:05\
lord\
4:07\
the savior urged therefore i give unto\
4:10\
you a commandment\
4:11\
to teach these things freely unto your\
4:14\
children\
4:16\
and what did he want us to teach so\
4:18\
freely\
4:19\
the fall of adam the atonement of jesus\
4:23\
christ\
4:24\
and being born again elder d\
4:27\
todd christopherson said quote\
4:30\
certainly the adversary is pleased when\
4:33\
parents neglect to teach and train their\
4:35\
children\
4:35\
to have faith in christ and be\
4:38\
spiritually born again\
4:40\
close quote in contrast\
4:43\
the savior would have us help children\
4:45\
put their trust in that spirit which\
4:47\
lead us to do good\
4:49\
to do so we can assist children in\
4:51\
recognizing when they are feeling the\
4:53\
spirit\
4:54\
and in discerning what actions cause the\
4:57\
spirit to leave\
4:59\
thus they learn to repent and return to\
5:02\
the light through the atonement of jesus\
5:05\
christ\
5:06\
this helps encourage spiritual\
5:08\
resilience\
5:10\
we can have fun helping our children\
5:13\
build spiritual resilience\
5:15\
at any age it doesn't have to be\
5:17\
complicated or time intensive\
5:20\
simple caring conversations can lead\
5:23\
children to know not only what they\
5:25\
believe\
5:26\
but most important why they believe it\
5:30\
caring conversations happening naturally\
5:33\
and consistently\
5:34\
can lead to better understanding and\
5:37\
answers\
5:38\
let's not allow the convenience of\
5:41\
electronic devices to keep us from\
5:44\
teaching and listening to our children\
5:47\
and looking into their eyes\
5:51\
additional opportunities for essential\
5:53\
conversations can occur\
5:55\
through role-playing family members can\
5:58\
act out situations of being\
6:00\
tempted or pressured to make a bad\
6:03\
choice\
6:04\
such an exercise can fortify children to\
6:06\
be prepared in a challenging setting\
6:10\
for example we can act it out and then\
6:13\
talk it out as we ask children what they\
6:16\
would do\
6:17\
if they are tempted to break the word of\
6:19\
wisdom\
6:20\
if they are exposed to pornography\
6:23\
if they are tempted to lie steal or\
6:26\
cheat\
6:28\
if they hear something from a friend or\
6:30\
teacher at school\
6:31\
that disputes their beliefs or values\
6:35\
as they act it out and then talk it out\
6:39\
rather than being caught unprepared in a\
6:41\
hostile peer group\
6:42\
setting children can be armed with the\
6:45\
shield of faith wherewith they shall be\
6:47\
able to quench\
6:48\
all the fiery darts of the wicked\
6:51\
a close personal friend learned this\
6:53\
crucial lesson as an 18 year old\
6:55\
he enlisted in the united states\
6:57\
military during the conflict between the\
6:59\
united states and vietnam\
7:02\
he was assigned to basic training in the\
7:04\
infantry\
7:05\
to become a foot soldier he explained\
7:08\
that the training was grueling\
7:10\
he described his drill instructor as\
7:12\
cruel\
7:13\
and inhumane one particular day\
7:16\
his squad was dressed in full battle\
7:19\
gear hiking in\
7:20\
sweltering heat the drill instructor\
7:23\
suddenly shouted orders to drop to the\
7:25\
ground\
7:26\
and not move the instructor was watching\
7:29\
for\
7:29\
even the slightest motion\
7:32\
any movement would result in serious\
7:35\
consequences later on\
7:37\
the squad suffered for more than two\
7:39\
hours in the heat with growing\
7:41\
anger and resentment toward their leader\
7:45\
many months later our friend found\
7:47\
himself leading his squad through the\
7:48\
jungles of vietnam\
7:50\
this was real not just training\
7:54\
shots began to ring from high in the\
7:56\
surrounding trees\
7:58\
the entire squad immediately dropped to\
8:00\
the ground\
8:02\
what was the enemy looking for movement\
8:06\
any motion at all would draw fire\
8:11\
my friend said that is he laid sweating\
8:13\
and motionless\
8:15\
on the jungle floor waiting for dark for\
8:17\
several long hours\
8:19\
his thoughts reflected back on basic\
8:22\
training\
8:23\
he remembered his intense dislike for\
8:26\
his drill instructor\
8:28\
now he felt intense gratitude\
8:31\
for what he had taught him and how he\
8:34\
had prepared him\
8:35\
for this critical situation the drill\
8:38\
instructor had wisely\
8:40\
equipped our friend and his squad with\
8:43\
the ability to know what to do\
8:45\
when the battle was raging he had\
8:48\
in effect saved our friend's life\
8:52\
how can we do the same for our children\
8:56\
spiritually long before they enter the\
8:59\
battlefield of life how can we more\
9:01\
fully strive to teach\
9:03\
fortify and prepare them how can we\
9:06\
invite them\
9:08\
to get far enough in wouldn't we rather\
9:12\
have them sweat in the safe learning\
9:15\
environment\
9:15\
of the home than bleed on the\
9:18\
battlefields\
9:19\
of life i look back\
9:23\
there were times when my husband and i\
9:25\
felt like drill instructors\
9:26\
in our earnestness to help our children\
9:29\
live the gospel of jesus christ\
9:32\
the prophet jacob seemed to voice these\
9:34\
same feelings when he said\
9:36\
i am desirous for the welfare of your\
9:39\
souls\
9:40\
yea my anxiety is great for you and ye\
9:43\
yourselves know that it ever has been\
9:47\
as children learn and progress their\
9:49\
beliefs will be challenged\
9:51\
but as they are properly equipped they\
9:54\
can grow in\
9:55\
faith courage and confidence\
9:58\
even in the midst of strong opposition\
10:01\
alma taught us to prepare the minds of\
10:03\
the children\
10:05\
we are preparing the rising generation\
10:07\
to be the future defenders of the faith\
10:10\
to understand that they are free to act\
10:12\
for themselves\
10:13\
to choose the way of everlasting death\
10:16\
or the way of eternal\
10:18\
life children deserve to understand this\
10:21\
great truth\
10:23\
eternity is the wrong thing to be wrong\
10:25\
about\
10:27\
may our simple yet essential\
10:29\
conversations with our children help\
10:31\
them to enjoy the words of eternal life\
10:33\
now so that they may enjoy eternal life\
10:37\
in the world to come\
10:38\
even immortal glory as we nurture and\
10:42\
prepare our children\
10:43\
we allow for their agency we love them\
10:46\
with all our heart\
10:48\
we teach them god's commandments and his\
10:50\
gift of repentance and we never\
10:52\
ever give up on them after all isn't\
10:55\
this the lord's way with each of us\
10:58\
let us press forward with a\
11:00\
steadfastness in christ knowing that we\
11:02\
can have\
11:03\
a perfect brightness of hope through our\
11:05\
loving savior\
11:07\
i testify that he is always the answer\
11:10\
in the sacred name of jesus christ amen\
