As I read the book of\
Acts and Paul's epistles,\
0:03\
I am amazed on how Paul was\
driven by love and gratitude\
0:07\
in serving, teaching, and\
testifying of Jesus Christ.\
0:11\
How can such a person serve\
with such love and gratitude,\
0:15\
especially considering\
his great sufferings?\
0:18\
What motivated Paul to serve?\
0:22\
"I press toward the mark for\
the prize of the high calling\
0:25\
of God in Christ Jesus."\
0:28\
To press toward the\
mark is to faithfully\
0:31\
continue on the\
"strait and narrow path\
0:33\
which leads to eternal life"\
with our Savior and our Father\
0:38\
in Heaven.\
0:38\
Paul reviewed his\
sufferings as "not worthy\
0:42\
to be compared with the glory\
which shall be revealed in us."\
0:47\
Paul's letter to\
the Philippians,\
0:49\
which he wrote when he\
was bound in prison,\
0:51\
is a letter of overwhelming joy\
and rejoicing and encouragement\
0:57\
to all of us, particularly\
in this difficult time\
1:00\
of uncertainty.\
1:02\
We all need to take courage\
from Paul: "I count all things\
1:07\
but loss for the excellency of\
the knowledge of Christ Jesus\
1:11\
my Lord: for whom\
I have suffered\
1:14\
the loss of all things,\
and do count them but dung,\
1:18\
that I may win Christ."\
1:20\
While we look at Paul's service,\
we are inspired and uplifted\
1:24\
by our own "Pauls" in our\
day, who also serve, teach,\
1:30\
and testify with love\
and gratitude amidst\
1:33\
the challenges they\
face in their lives\
1:36\
and in the lives of\
their loved ones.\
1:38\
An experience I\
had nine years ago\
1:41\
helped me to realize\
the importance\
1:43\
of pressing towards the mark.\
1:45\
In 2012, as I walked\
for the first time\
1:49\
in the General Conference\
Leadership Meeting,\
1:51\
I could not help feeling\
overwhelmed and inadequate.\
1:56\
In my mind there was a voice\
persistently repeating:\
2:00\
"You do not belong here!\
2:02\
A serious mistake\
had been made!"\
2:05\
Just as I was walking, trying\
to find a place to sit,\
2:09\
Elder Jeffrey R.\
Holland spotted me.\
2:12\
He came to me and said, "Edward,\
it is good to see you here,"\
2:16\
and he tenderly patted my face.\
2:19\
I felt like a baby!\
2:22\
His love and\
embrace warmed me up\
2:25\
and helped me to feel\
the spirit of belonging,\
2:29\
the spirit of brotherhood.\
2:31\
On the following day, I\
observed Elder Holland\
2:34\
doing the same thing he had\
done to me on the previous day:\
2:38\
warmly patting Elder Dallin H.\
Oaks's face, who is his senior!\
2:43\
At that moment I felt the\
Lord's love through these men\
2:49\
we sustain as prophets,\
seers, and revelators.\
2:52\
Elder Holland through\
his kind, natural actions\
2:56\
helped me to overcome\
my self-centeredness\
2:59\
and my feelings of inadequacy.\
3:02\
He helped me to focus on the\
sacred and joyful work to which\
3:06\
I had been called--to\
bring souls to Christ.\
3:10\
He, like Paul of old, pointed\
me to press toward the mark.\
3:15\
Interestingly, Paul is exhorting\
us to press forward while\
3:19\
calling us to forget that which\
is behind--our past fears,\
3:24\
our past focus, our past\
failures, and our past sadness.\
3:29\
He is inviting us, just like our\
dear prophet, President Russell\
3:34\
M. Nelson, to "a newer,\
holier approach."\
3:38\
The Savior's promise\
is real: "For whosoever\
3:42\
will save his life\
shall lose it:\
3:45\
and whosoever will lose his\
life for my sake shall find it."\
3:50\
In my first general\
conference address,\
3:52\
I shared an experience\
of my mother\
3:54\
teaching me to\
work in our field.\
3:57\
"Never look back," she said.\
3:59\
"Look ahead at what\
we still have to do!"\
4:02\
Towards the end of her life,\
while mother battled cancer,\
4:06\
she lived with Naume and me.\
4:08\
One night I heard her\
sobbing in her bedroom.\
4:11\
Her pain was intense\
even after taking\
4:15\
her last daily dose of morphine\
only two hours earlier.\
4:19\
I entered her room\
and sobbed with her.\
4:23\
I prayed aloud for her\
to receive instant relief\
4:27\
from her pain.\
4:28\
And then she did the same thing\
she had done in the field years\
4:32\
ago: she stopped and\
taught me a lesson.\
4:35\
I will never forget her face at\
that moment: frail, stricken,\
4:41\
and full of pain, gazing with\
pity on her sorrowing son.\
4:46\
She smiled through her tears,\
looked directly into my eyes,\
4:50\
and said, "It is not up\
to you or anyone else,\
4:54\
but it is up to God whether\
this pain will go away or not."\
4:59\
I sat up quietly.\
5:01\
She too sat quietly.\
5:04\
The scene remains\
vivid in my mind.\
5:07\
That night, through\
my mother, the Lord\
5:10\
taught me a lesson that\
will stay with me forever.\
5:14\
As my mother expressed her\
acceptance of God's will,\
5:18\
I remembered the reason\
Jesus Christ suffered\
5:21\
in the Garden of Gethsemane\
and on the cross at Golgotha.\
5:25\
He said, "Behold I have\
given unto you my gospel,\
5:29\
and this is [my] gospel which\
I have given unto you--that I\
5:32\
came into the world to\
do the will of my Father,\
5:36\
because my Father sent me."\
5:38\
As I reflect on our dear\
prophet President Nelson's\
5:41\
prophetic questions to us on\
the last general conference,\
5:45\
President Nelson\
asked: "Are you willing\
5:48\
to let God prevail in your life?\
5:50\
Are you willing to let God be\
the most important influence\
5:54\
in your life?\
5:55\
Will you allow His\
voice to take precedence\
5:58\
over every other ambition?\
6:00\
Are you willing to have your\
will swallowed up in His?"\
6:05\
My mother would have responded\
with an emotional but firm\
6:09\
"yes," and other\
faithful members\
6:11\
of the Church across\
the globe would also\
6:14\
respond with an\
emotional but firm "yes."\
6:18\
President Nelson, thank you\
for inspiring and uplifting us\
6:22\
with these prophetic questions.\
6:25\
Recently I had a conversation\
in Pretoria, South Africa,\
6:29\
with a bishop who buried his\
wife and his adult daughter\
6:33\
on the same day.\
6:35\
Their lives were claimed by\
this coronavirus pandemic.\
6:39\
I asked how he was doing.\
6:40\
Bishop Teddy Thabete's response\
strengthened my resolve\
6:45\
to follow the words and counsel\
from the Lord's prophets,\
6:49\
seers, and revelators.\
6:50\
Bishop Thabete responded\
that there is always\
6:53\
hope and comfort in knowing\
that the Savior has taken\
6:57\
upon Himself the\
pains of His people,\
7:01\
that He may know\
how to succor us.\
7:04\
With deep faith he\
testified, "I am grateful\
7:07\
for the plan of salvation,\
the plan of happiness."\
7:10\
He then asked me a\
question: "Is this not\
7:15\
what our prophet was trying to\
teach us this last conference?"\
7:19\
While the challenges of\
mortality will come to all\
7:22\
of us in one way or another,\
let us focus on the goal\
7:26\
of our "[pressing]\
toward the mark,"\
7:28\
which is "the prize of\
the high calling of God."\
7:32\
My humble invitation to all\
of us is to never give up!\
7:36\
We are called to "lay aside\
every weight, and the sin which\
7:40\
doth so easily beset us, and let\
us run with patience the race\
7:45\
that is set before us,\
Looking unto Jesus the author\
7:49\
and finisher of our faith."\
7:51\
It is not so much about what\
we are going through in life\
7:54\
but what we are becoming.\
7:56\
There is joy in pressing\
toward the mark.\
8:00\
I testify that He who overcame\
all will help us as we\
8:05\
look up to Him.\
8:06\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
