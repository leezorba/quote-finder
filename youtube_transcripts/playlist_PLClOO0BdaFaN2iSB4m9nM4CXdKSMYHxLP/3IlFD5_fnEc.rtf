My beloved brothers and\
sisters, we have truly\
0:03\
had a spiritual feast.\
0:05\
How grateful I am for the\
prayers, messages, and music\
0:09\
of the entire conference.\
0:11\
Thanks to each of you\
for joining with us,\
0:14\
wherever you are.\
0:18\
Early last year, because\
of the COVID-19 pandemic\
0:22\
and our desire to be\
good global citizens,\
0:27\
we made the difficult\
decision to close all temples\
0:32\
temporarily.\
0:34\
During the ensuing\
months, we have\
0:37\
felt inspired to reopen\
temples gradually\
0:41\
through a very\
cautious approach.\
0:45\
Temples are now being\
opened in four phases,\
0:49\
adhering strictly to local\
government regulations\
0:54\
and safety protocols.\
0:59\
For temples in phase\
1, qualified couples\
1:03\
who have previously\
received their own endowment\
1:06\
can be sealed as\
husband and wife.\
1:12\
For temples in phase 2, all\
ordinances for the living\
1:17\
are performed, including\
one's own endowment,\
1:21\
the sealing of husband and\
wife, and children to parents.\
1:27\
We have recently amended\
provisions of phase 2\
1:32\
and allow our\
youth, new members,\
1:36\
and others with a\
limited-use recommend\
1:39\
to participate in proxy\
baptisms for their ancestors.\
1:47\
For temples in phase 3, those\
with scheduled appointments\
1:52\
may participate not only in\
ordinances for the living,\
1:57\
but also in all proxy ordinances\
for deceased ancestors.\
2:04\
Phase 4 is a return to full,\
regular temple activity.\
2:11\
We are grateful for your\
patience and devoted service\
2:14\
during this changing\
and challenging period.\
2:17\
I pray that your desire to\
worship and serve in the temple\
2:22\
burns more brightly\
now than ever.\
2:27\
Now, you may be wondering\
when you will be\
2:29\
able to return to the temple.\
2:31\
Answer: your temple will be\
open when local government\
2:38\
regulations allow it.\
2:42\
When the incidence of\
COVID-19 in your area\
2:45\
is within safe limits, your\
temple will be reopened.\
2:51\
Do all you can to bring COVID\
numbers down in your area\
2:56\
so that your temple\
opportunities can increase.\
3:03\
Meanwhile, keep your temple\
covenants and blessings\
3:06\
foremost in your\
minds and hearts.\
3:09\
Stay true to the\
covenants you have made.\
3:15\
We are building\
now for the future!\
3:17\
Forty-one temples are\
presently under construction\
3:23\
or renovation.\
3:26\
Just last year,\
despite the pandemic,\
3:29\
ground was broken\
for 21 new temples!\
3:37\
We want to bring the house\
of the Lord even closer\
3:39\
to our members,\
that they may have\
3:42\
the sacred privilege\
of attending the temple\
3:45\
as often as their\
circumstances allow.\
3:51\
As I announce our plans to\
construct 20 more temples,\
3:59\
I ponder and praise\
pioneers--past\
4:03\
and present--whose consecrated\
lives have helped to make this\
4:10\
history today.\
4:14\
A new temple will\
be built in each\
4:17\
of the following locations:\
4:21\
Oslo, Norway\
4:24\
Brussels, Belgium\
4:28\
Vienna, Austria\
4:32\
Kumasi, Ghana\
4:36\
Beira, Mozambique\
4:39\
Cape Town, South Africa\
4:43\
Singapore, Republic of Singapore\
4:47\
Belo Horizonte, Brazil\
4:51\
Cali, Colombia\
4:55\
Querétaro, Mexico\
4:58\
Torreón, Mexico\
5:02\
Helena, Montana\
5:05\
Casper, Wyoming\
5:08\
Grand Junction, Colorado\
5:12\
Farmington, New Mexico\
5:16\
Burley, Idaho\
5:19\
Eugene, Oregon\
5:22\
Elko, Nevada\
5:25\
Yorba Linda, California\
5:29\
and Smithfield, Utah.\
5:35\
Temples are a vital part of\
the Restoration of the gospel\
5:38\
of Jesus Christ in its fulness.\
5:41\
Ordinances of the temple\
fill our lives with power\
5:45\
and strength--available\
in no other way.\
5:49\
We thank God for\
those blessings.\
5:56\
As we close this conference, we\
again express our love for you.\
6:01\
We pray that God will\
shower His blessings\
6:04\
and watchcare upon each of you.\
6:09\
Together, we are engaged\
in His sacred service.\
6:14\
With courage, let\
us all press on\
6:19\
in the glorious\
work of the Lord!\
6:22\
For this I pray in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
