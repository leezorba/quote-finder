dear brothers and sisters\
0:03\
although he passed away 20 years ago\
0:07\
there are times i miss my father\
0:10\
easter promises i will see him again\
0:14\
when i was in graduate school in england\
0:16\
my father came to visit\
0:18\
his father's heart knew i missed home\
0:21\
my father loved adventure except in food\
0:25\
even in france noted for its cuisine he\
0:27\
would say\
0:29\
let's eat chinese food a long-serving\
0:32\
patriarch in the church my father was\
0:34\
spiritual\
0:35\
and compassionate one night as emergency\
0:39\
vehicles with\
0:40\
loud sirens raced through paris he said\
0:42\
garrett\
0:43\
those cries are the wounds of a city\
0:47\
on that trip i felt other cries and\
0:49\
wounds\
0:51\
a young woman was selling ice cream from\
0:53\
a small pushcart\
0:55\
her wafer cones were just the size for a\
0:58\
single scoop of ice cream\
1:00\
for some reason a large man confronted\
1:03\
the young woman\
1:04\
yelling and pushing he tipped over her\
1:06\
cart\
1:07\
spilling her ice cream cones there was\
1:10\
nothing i could do as he crushed the\
1:12\
cones with his boots\
1:15\
i can still see the young woman on her\
1:17\
knees in the street\
1:19\
trying to save broken way for pieces\
1:22\
tears of anguish streaming down her face\
1:25\
her image haunts me a reminder of the\
1:28\
unkindness\
1:29\
uncaring misunderstanding we too often\
1:32\
inflict on each other\
1:35\
on another afternoon near paris my\
1:38\
father and i visited the great cathedral\
1:40\
at chartres\
1:41\
malcolm miller a world expert on the\
1:44\
cathedral\
1:45\
pointed out three sets of sharp stained\
1:48\
glass windows he said they tell a story\
1:51\
the first windows show adam and eve\
1:53\
leaving the garden of eden\
1:55\
the second recount the parable of the\
1:57\
good samaritan\
1:59\
the third depict the lord's second\
2:01\
coming\
2:03\
taken together these stained glass\
2:05\
windows can describe\
2:06\
our eternal journey they invited to\
2:09\
welcome all\
2:11\
with room in his end\
2:14\
like adam and eve we come into a world\
2:16\
of thorns and thistles\
2:18\
on our dusty roads to jericho we're\
2:20\
beset upon\
2:22\
wounded and left in pain\
2:25\
though we should help each other too\
2:26\
often we pass to the other side of the\
2:28\
road\
2:29\
for whatever reason however with\
2:32\
compassion\
2:33\
the good samaritan stops and binds our\
2:36\
wounds with\
2:37\
wine and oil symbols of the sacrament\
2:41\
and other ordinances\
2:43\
the wine and oil point us to the\
2:46\
spiritual healing\
2:47\
in jesus christ the good samaritan puts\
2:51\
us on his own donkey\
2:52\
or in some stained glass accounts\
2:54\
carries us on his shoulders\
2:57\
he brings us to the end which can\
2:59\
represent\
3:00\
his church at the end the good samaritan\
3:04\
says\
3:05\
take care of him when i come again i\
3:08\
will repay thee\
3:10\
the good samaritan a symbol of our\
3:12\
savior promises to return\
3:15\
this time in majesty and glory\
3:20\
in this easter season jesus christ\
3:22\
invites us to become\
3:24\
like him a good samaritan\
3:27\
to make his in his church\
3:30\
a refuge for all from life's bruises and\
3:34\
storms\
3:35\
we prepare for his promised second\
3:37\
coming\
3:38\
as each day we do unto the least of\
3:40\
these\
3:41\
as we would unto him the least of these\
3:45\
is each of us as we come with the good\
3:49\
samaritan to the end\
3:51\
we learn five things about jesus christ\
3:54\
and ourselves\
3:55\
first we come to the end as we are with\
3:58\
the foibles and imperfections we each\
4:01\
have\
4:02\
yet we all have something needed to\
4:05\
contribute\
4:06\
our journey to god is often found\
4:08\
together\
4:09\
we belong as united community\
4:13\
whether confronting pandemics storms\
4:15\
wildfires droughts\
4:17\
or quietly meeting daily needs we\
4:20\
receive inspiration as we\
4:22\
counsel together listening to each\
4:24\
person\
4:25\
including each sister and the spirit\
4:29\
as our hearts change and we receive his\
4:32\
image in our countenance\
4:34\
we see him and ourselves in his church\
4:38\
in him we find clarity not dissonance\
4:41\
in him we find cause to do good\
4:45\
reason to be good and increasing\
4:48\
capacity\
4:49\
to become better in him we discover\
4:52\
abiding faith\
4:54\
liberating selflessness caring change\
4:57\
and trusting god in his in\
5:00\
we find and deepen our personal\
5:02\
relationship with god our father\
5:05\
and jesus christ he trusts\
5:08\
us to help make the end the place he\
5:10\
needs it to be\
5:12\
as we offer our talents and best efforts\
5:14\
his spiritual gifts\
5:16\
also strengthen and bless a spanish\
5:19\
language interpreter told me\
5:21\
elder gong i knew by the spirit what you\
5:25\
were going to say\
5:26\
so i could translate this faithful\
5:28\
brother's head\
5:30\
by the gift of tongues gifts of faith\
5:33\
and assurance come\
5:34\
manifest differently in different\
5:36\
situations\
5:38\
one dear sister received spiritual\
5:40\
comfort\
5:42\
as her husband passed away from covet\
5:44\
19.\
5:45\
she said i know my dear husband and i\
5:48\
will be together again\
5:51\
in a different covid situation another\
5:54\
dear sister said\
5:55\
i felt i should plead with the lord and\
5:57\
the doctors\
5:59\
to give my husband just a little more\
6:01\
time\
6:03\
second he entreats us to make his in a\
6:06\
place of grace\
6:08\
and space where each can gather with\
6:11\
room for all as disciples of jesus\
6:15\
christ we are all equal\
6:16\
with no second class groups all are\
6:19\
welcome\
6:20\
to attend sacrament meetings other\
6:22\
sunday meetings\
6:23\
and social events we reverently worship\
6:26\
our savior\
6:27\
thoughtful and considerate of each other\
6:30\
we see and acknowledge each person\
6:34\
we smile sit with those sitting alone\
6:37\
learn names including of new converts\
6:40\
returning brothers and sisters young\
6:43\
women and young men\
6:44\
each dear primary child\
6:48\
imagining ourselves in their place we\
6:50\
welcome friends visitors new move-ins\
6:52\
busy individuals pulled in too many\
6:55\
directions\
6:57\
we mourn rejoice and are there\
7:00\
for each other when we fall short of our\
7:03\
ideals\
7:04\
and are rushed unaware judgmental\
7:08\
or prejudiced we seek each other's\
7:10\
forgiveness\
7:12\
and do better a family from africa now\
7:15\
living in the united states said\
7:18\
from the first day church members were\
7:20\
friendly and welcoming\
7:22\
everyone made us feel at home no one\
7:25\
looked down on us the father said\
7:29\
the holy bible teaches gospel fruits\
7:32\
come from gospel roots and the\
7:34\
missionaries\
7:35\
the father and mother said we want our\
7:38\
son and daughter to grow up like those\
7:40\
missionaries\
7:42\
brothers and sisters may we each warmly\
7:45\
welcome\
7:45\
all to his in\
7:49\
third in his end we learn perfection\
7:53\
is in jesus christ not in the\
7:56\
perfectionism of the world\
7:59\
unreal and unrealistic the world's\
8:02\
insta-perfect filtered perfectionism\
8:06\
can make us feel inadequate captive to\
8:08\
swipes\
8:09\
lights or double taps in contrast\
8:13\
our savior jesus christ knows everything\
8:16\
about us we don't want\
8:17\
anyone else to know and he still loves\
8:20\
us\
8:22\
his is a gospel of second and third\
8:24\
chances\
8:25\
made possible by his atoning sacrifice\
8:29\
he invites each of us to be a good\
8:32\
samaritan\
8:33\
less judgmental and more forgiving\
8:37\
of ourselves and of each other\
8:40\
even as we strive more fully to keep his\
8:43\
commandments\
8:46\
we help ourselves as we help each other\
8:48\
a family i know lived near a busy road\
8:52\
travelers often stopped to ask for help\
8:55\
early one morning the family heard loud\
8:57\
pounding on their door\
8:59\
tired and worried who it would be at 2\
9:02\
am\
9:03\
they wondered if justice once\
9:06\
someone else could help as the insistent\
9:09\
knocking continued they heard\
9:11\
fire there's a fire in the back of your\
9:14\
house\
9:16\
good samaritans help each other\
9:20\
fourth at is in we become\
9:23\
part of a gospel community centered in\
9:26\
jesus christ\
9:27\
anchored in restored truth living\
9:30\
prophets and apostles\
9:31\
and another testament of jesus christ\
9:34\
the book of mormon he brings us to his\
9:38\
inn\
9:39\
and also to his house the holy temple\
9:43\
the house of the lord is a place where\
9:46\
as with the wounded man on the road to\
9:49\
jericho\
9:50\
the good samaritan can cleanse and\
9:53\
clothe us\
9:54\
prepare us to return to god's presence\
9:57\
and unite us eternally and god's family\
10:00\
his temples are open to all who live his\
10:03\
gospel with faith\
10:05\
and obedience temple rejoicing\
10:09\
includes gospel unity amidst diverse\
10:11\
heritages\
10:12\
cultures languages and generations\
10:16\
at the groundbreaking for the\
10:17\
taylorsville utah temple\
10:19\
seventeen-year-old max harker shared a\
10:22\
legacy of family\
10:24\
faith begun six generations earlier\
10:27\
by his great great great grandfather\
10:31\
joseph harker and his wife susanna\
10:34\
sneath\
10:36\
in the restored gospel of jesus christ\
10:38\
we can each become a strong link\
10:41\
in our family generations\
10:44\
finally fifth we rejoice that god loves\
10:49\
his children and our different\
10:50\
backgrounds and circumstances\
10:52\
in every nation kindred and tongue with\
10:56\
room for\
10:57\
all in his end\
11:00\
over the past 40 years church members\
11:02\
have become increasingly international\
11:05\
since 1998 more church members\
11:08\
lived outside than inside the united\
11:11\
states and canada\
11:13\
by 2025 we anticipate as many church\
11:17\
members may live in latin america\
11:19\
as in the united states and canada the\
11:22\
gathering of fathers lehi's faithful\
11:24\
descendants is fulfilling prophecy\
11:27\
faithful saints including in the pioneer\
11:30\
quarter\
11:31\
remain a reservoir of devotion and\
11:33\
service for the worldwide church\
11:36\
also the majority of adult church\
11:38\
members are now unmarried widowed or\
11:40\
divorced this is a significant change\
11:44\
it includes more than half of our\
11:45\
release society sisters\
11:47\
and more than half our adult priesthood\
11:49\
brothers\
11:50\
this demographic pattern has been the\
11:52\
case in the worldwide church since 1992\
11:55\
and in the church in the united states\
11:57\
and canada\
11:58\
since 2019 our standing before the lord\
12:02\
in his church\
12:04\
is not a matter of our marital status\
12:06\
but of our becoming\
12:08\
faithful and valiant disciples of jesus\
12:10\
christ\
12:12\
adults want to be seen as adults and to\
12:14\
be responsible\
12:15\
and contribute as adults disciples of\
12:19\
jesus christ come from everywhere\
12:21\
in every shape size hue age\
12:24\
each with talents righteous desires and\
12:27\
immense capacities to bless and serve\
12:31\
we seek daily to follow jesus christ\
12:33\
with faith unto repentance\
12:35\
and enduring joy during this life\
12:40\
we sometimes wait upon the lord we may\
12:43\
not yet be where we hope and wish to be\
12:45\
in the future\
12:47\
a devout sister says waiting faithfully\
12:51\
upon the lord for his blessings\
12:53\
is a holy position it must not be met\
12:57\
with pity\
12:58\
patronizing or judgment but instead\
13:01\
with sacred honor in the meantime\
13:05\
we live now not waiting for life to\
13:08\
begin\
13:10\
isaiah promises they that wait upon the\
13:14\
lord\
13:15\
shall renew their strength they shall\
13:18\
mount up with wings as eagles\
13:20\
they shall run and not be weary and they\
13:24\
shall walk\
13:25\
and not faint\
13:28\
our good samaritan promises to return\
13:32\
miracles occur when we care for each\
13:35\
other\
13:36\
as he would when we come with broken\
13:39\
hearts and contrite spirits\
13:42\
we can find voice in jesus christ\
13:46\
and be encircled in his understanding\
13:49\
arms of safety\
13:52\
sacred ordinances offer covenant\
13:54\
belonging\
13:56\
and the power of godliness to sanctify\
13:59\
inner intent\
14:01\
and outward action\
14:04\
as we create room in his end welcoming\
14:07\
all our good samaritan can heal us\
14:11\
on our dusty mortal roads with\
14:14\
perfect love our father and his son\
14:17\
jesus christ\
14:19\
promise peace in this world\
14:22\
and eternal life and the world come\
14:26\
i so gratefully witness and testify\
14:29\
in the sacred and holy name of jesus\
14:31\
christ\
14:42\
amen\
14:44\
you\
