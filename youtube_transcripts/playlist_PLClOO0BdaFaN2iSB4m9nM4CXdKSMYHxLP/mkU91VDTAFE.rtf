My beloved brothers\
and sisters, I'm\
0:03\
so grateful for the privilege\
to address you from Africa.\
0:07\
It is a blessing to have\
the technology today\
0:09\
and to use it in the most\
effective way to reach out\
0:13\
to you wherever you are.\
0:15\
In September 2019,\
Sister Mutombo and I,\
0:18\
while serving as leaders of\
the Maryland Baltimore Mission,\
0:22\
had the privilege to visit\
some Church historical sites\
0:26\
in Palmyra, New York,\
while attending the mission\
0:29\
leadership seminar.\
0:30\
We ended our visit in the Sacred\
0:33\
Grove.\
0:34\
Our intention in\
visiting the Sacred Grove\
0:36\
was not to have a special\
manifestation or a vision,\
0:40\
but we did feel God's\
presence in this sacred place.\
0:44\
Our hearts were\
filled with gratitude\
0:46\
for the Prophet Joseph Smith.\
0:48\
On the way back,\
Sister Mutombo noticed\
0:51\
that I had a big\
smile while driving,\
0:53\
so she asked, "What is the\
reason for your excitement?"\
0:57\
I responded, "My dear\
Nathalie, the truth\
1:01\
will always triumph over\
error, and darkness will not\
1:04\
continue on earth\
because of the restored\
1:07\
gospel of Jesus Christ."\
1:09\
God the Father and Jesus Christ\
visited the young Joseph Smith\
1:14\
to bring to the light\
what was hidden,\
1:16\
so we may receive the knowledge\
of things as they are,\
1:20\
as they were, and\
as they will be.\
1:23\
After almost 200\
years, many still\
1:26\
seek the truths needed to\
become free of some of the\
1:30\
traditions and the\
lies that the adversary\
1:34\
spreads throughout the world.\
1:36\
Many are "blinded by the\
subtle craftiness of men."\
1:41\
In his epistle to the\
Ephesians, Paul taught,\
1:45\
"Awake thou that sleepest,\
and arise from the dead,\
1:50\
and Christ shall give\
thee [the] light."\
1:53\
The Savior promised that he\
will be the light unto all\
1:56\
that hear His words.\
1:59\
Thirty-five years\
ago, my parents\
2:01\
were also blinded and\
were desperately seeking\
2:04\
to know the truth\
and were concerned\
2:07\
about where to turn to find it.\
2:10\
My parents were both born in the\
2:12\
village, where the\
traditions were really\
2:15\
rooted in individuals'\
and families' lives.\
2:18\
They both left their\
village when they were young\
2:21\
and came to the city,\
looking for a better life.\
2:25\
They were married and\
started their family\
2:28\
in a very modest way.\
2:30\
We were almost eight people\
in a small house--my parents,\
2:35\
two of my sisters, and I, and\
a cousin who used to live with\
2:39\
us.\
2:39\
I was wondering if we were\
truly a family as we were not\
2:44\
permitted to have dinner at the\
same table with our parents.\
2:48\
When our dad returned\
from work, as soon\
2:52\
as he entered the\
house, we were asked\
2:55\
to leave and to go outside.\
2:58\
Our nights were very\
short, as we could not\
3:01\
sleep because of\
the lack of harmony\
3:03\
and true love in our\
parents' marriage.\
3:06\
Our home was not only small in\
size, but it was a dark place.\
3:12\
Before meeting with\
the missionaries,\
3:14\
we attended different\
churches every Sunday.\
3:18\
It was clear that\
our parents were\
3:21\
seeking for something that\
the world could not provide.\
3:26\
This went on until we\
met with Elder and Sister\
3:30\
Hutchings, the first\
senior missionary couple\
3:33\
called to serve in\
Zaire (known today as DR\
3:36\
of Congo or Congo-Kinshasa).\
3:39\
When we started meeting with\
these wonderful missionaries,\
3:43\
who were like angels\
that came from God,\
3:47\
I noticed that something\
started to change in our family.\
3:52\
After our baptism,\
we truly started\
3:55\
to progressively\
have a new lifestyle\
3:58\
because of the restored gospel.\
4:00\
The words of Christ began\
to enlarge our souls.\
4:04\
They began to enlighten our\
4:06\
understanding and became\
delicious to us, as the truths\
4:10\
that we received\
were discernable\
4:13\
and we could see the\
light, and this light\
4:16\
grew brighter and\
brighter daily.\
4:19\
This understanding of\
the "why" of the gospel\
4:22\
was helping us to become\
more like the Savior.\
4:25\
The size of our\
home did not change;\
4:28\
neither did our\
social conditions.\
4:31\
But I witnessed a change\
of heart of my parents\
4:35\
as we prayed daily,\
morning and evening.\
4:38\
We studied the book of Mormon;\
we held family home evening;\
4:43\
we truly became a family.\
4:45\
Every Sunday, we\
woke up at 6:00 a.m.\
4:48\
to prepare to go to church,\
and we would travel for hours\
4:53\
to attend church meetings\
every week without complaining.\
4:57\
It was a wonderful\
experience to witness.\
5:00\
We, who previously\
walked in darkness,\
5:03\
chased darkness from among\
us and saw "great light."\
5:08\
I remember one day, when\
I was not willing to wake\
5:11\
up early in the morning\
for our family prayer, I\
5:15\
MURMURED TO MY SISTERS: "There\
is truly nothing else that we\
5:19\
can do in this home, only pray,\
5:21\
pray, pray."\
5:23\
My dad heard my comments.\
5:25\
I remember his reaction as he\
lovingly but firmly taught me:\
5:30\
"As long as you will\
be in this house,\
5:33\
you will pray, pray, pray."\
5:36\
My father's words\
sounded in my ears daily.\
5:39\
What do you think Sister Mutombo\
and I do with our children\
5:42\
today?\
5:43\
We pray, pray, and pray.\
5:45\
This is our legacy.\
5:48\
The man that was born blind\
and was healed by Jesus Christ,\
5:52\
after being pressured by his\
neighbors and the Pharisees,\
5:56\
said: "A man that is called\
Jesus made clay, and anointed\
6:02\
mine eyes, and said unto me,\
go to the pool of Siloam,\
6:06\
and wash: and I went and\
washed, and I received sight.\
6:11\
...\
6:11\
One thing [that] I know\
[is that] I was blind,\
6:15\
now I [can] see."\
6:17\
We also were blind\
and can now see.\
6:20\
The restored gospel has impacted\
our family since that time.\
6:24\
Understanding the\
"why" of the gospel\
6:27\
has blessed three\
generations of my family\
6:30\
and will continue to bless\
many generations to come.\
6:34\
Jesus Christ is the light\
that shines in darkness.\
6:38\
He that follows Him "shall\
not walk in darkness,\
6:41\
but shall have the\
light of life."\
6:43\
For almost a year\
between 2016 and 2017,\
6:48\
the people in the Kasai region\
faced a terrible tragedy.\
6:53\
It was a very dark period\
for the people because\
6:56\
of a conflict between a\
traditional group of warriors\
7:00\
and government forces.\
7:02\
The violence spread from towns\
in Kasai-Central province\
7:06\
to the wider Kasai region.\
7:08\
Many people fled their homes\
for safety and hid in the bush.\
7:13\
They had no food or\
water or anything really,\
7:17\
and among these\
were some members\
7:20\
of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day\
7:22\
Saints in the Kananga area.\
7:25\
Some members of the Church\
were killed by the militia.\
7:29\
Brother Honor√à Mulumba of the\
Nganza Ward in Kananga and his\
7:33\
family were some of the few\
people who remained hidden in\
7:38\
their house, not knowing where\
to go because all the streets\
7:42\
were transformed\
into firing ranges.\
7:46\
One day some\
neighborhood militiamen\
7:49\
had noticed the presence of\
Brother Mulumba and his family\
7:52\
as one evening they\
went out to try\
7:55\
to find some vegetables\
in the family garden\
7:58\
to eat.\
7:59\
A group of the militia\
came to their home\
8:02\
and then pulled them out\
and told them to choose to\
8:06\
adhere to their\
militia practices\
8:09\
or they would be killed.\
8:11\
Brother Mulumba\
courageously told them:\
8:15\
"I'm a member of The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
8:18\
Saints.\
8:19\
My family and I have\
accepted Jesus Christ\
8:22\
and have faith in Him.\
8:23\
We will remain faithful\
to our covenants\
8:26\
and will accept to die."\
8:28\
They told them, "As you\
have chosen Jesus Christ,\
8:31\
your bodies will be\
eaten by the dogs,"\
8:34\
and they promised to come back.\
8:36\
But they never did come\
back, and the family\
8:40\
stayed there for two months\
and never saw them again.\
8:43\
Brother Mulumba and his family\
kept the torch of their faith\
8:47\
alight.\
8:48\
They remembered their\
covenants and were protected.\
8:52\
Jesus Christ is the light\
that we should hold up even\
8:56\
during the dark times\
of our mortal life.\
8:59\
When we choose to follow\
Christ, we choose to be changed.\
9:03\
A man changed for Christ will be\
9:05\
captained by Christ,\
and we will be\
9:08\
asking as Paul did, "Lord,\
what wilt thou have me to do?"\
9:13\
We will "follow his steps."\
9:14\
We will "walk,\
even as he walked."\
9:17\
I testify of Him that died,\
was buried, and rose again\
9:20\
the third day and\
ascended into heaven\
9:23\
so that you and I may receive\
the blessings of immortality\
9:27\
and exaltation.\
9:28\
He is "the light, ...\
the life, and the truth."\
9:31\
He is the antidote and remedy\
to the confusion of the world.\
9:35\
He is the standard of\
excellence for exaltation, even\
9:39\
Jesus Christ.\
9:40\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
