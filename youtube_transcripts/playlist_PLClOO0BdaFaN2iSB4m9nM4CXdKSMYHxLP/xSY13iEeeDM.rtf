Each of us has been affected\
by the worldwide pandemic,\
0:04\
as family and friends\
have unexpectedly\
0:08\
moved beyond mortality.\
0:10\
Let me acknowledge\
three we dearly miss,\
0:13\
representing all\
those we love so much.\
0:18\
This is Brother Philippe\
and Sister Germain Nsondi.\
0:22\
Brother Nsondi was\
serving as the patriarch\
0:25\
of the Brazzaville Congo\
Stake when he passed away.\
0:29\
He was a medical doctor who\
shared his talents generously\
0:34\
with others.\
0:36\
This is Sister Clara Ruano de\
Villareal from Tulcn, Ecuador.\
0:44\
She embraced the\
restored gospel at age 34\
0:46\
and was a beloved leader.\
0:49\
Her family said goodbye singing\
her favorite hymn, "I Know\
0:54\
That My Redeemer Lives."\
0:58\
This is Brother Ray Tuineau from\
Utah with his beautiful family.\
1:03\
His wife, Juliet,\
said, "I want [my boys]\
1:08\
to [remember that their dad]\
always tried to put God first."\
1:15\
The Lord has said, "Thou\
shalt live together in love,\
1:19\
insomuch that thou shalt weep\
for the loss of them that die."\
1:23\
While we weep, we also rejoice\
in the glorious resurrection\
1:28\
of our Savior.\
1:30\
Because of Him, our\
loved ones and friends\
1:33\
continue their eternal journey.\
1:36\
As President Joseph\
F. Smith explained:\
1:39\
"We cannot forget them; we do\
not cease to love them. ...\
1:44\
They have advanced;\
we are advancing;\
1:47\
we are growing as\
they have grown."\
1:50\
President Russell M. Nelson\
said, "Our tears of sorrow ...\
1:55\
turn to tears of anticipation."\
2:00\
Our eternal perspective not\
only enlarges our understanding\
2:05\
of those who are continuing\
their journey beyond mortality\
2:09\
but also opens our\
understanding of those\
2:14\
who are earlier in their\
journey and just now\
2:18\
entering mortality.\
2:20\
Each person who comes to earth\
is a unique son or daughter\
2:25\
of God.\
2:26\
Our personal journey\
did not begin at birth.\
2:30\
Before we were born,\
we were together\
2:33\
in a world of\
preparation, where we\
2:36\
"received [our] first lessons\
in the world of spirits."\
2:40\
Jehovah told Jeremiah, "Before\
I formed thee in the belly\
2:44\
I knew thee; and\
before thou camest\
2:47\
forth out of the womb\
I sanctified thee."\
2:52\
Some may question if life\
begins with the formation\
2:56\
of an embryo, or when\
the heart begins to\
2:58\
beat, or when the baby\
can live outside the womb.\
3:03\
But for us, there is no question\
that spirit daughters and sons\
3:09\
of God are on their own\
personal journeys coming\
3:13\
to earth to receive a body\
and experience mortality.\
3:18\
As covenant children\
of God, we love, honor,\
3:23\
nurture, safeguard, and\
welcome those spirits\
3:27\
who are coming from\
the premortal world.\
3:31\
For a woman, having a child\
can be a great sacrifice\
3:36\
physically, emotionally,\
and economically.\
3:40\
We love and honor the\
amazing women of this Church.\
3:44\
With intelligence\
and wisdom, you\
3:47\
bear the burdens of your family.\
3:49\
You love.\
3:50\
You serve.\
3:51\
You sacrifice.\
3:52\
You strengthen faith,\
minister to those in need,\
3:56\
and greatly\
contribute to society.\
4:00\
Years ago, feeling deep concern\
for the number of abortions\
4:04\
in the world,\
President Gordon B.\
4:07\
Hinckley addressed the\
women of the Church\
4:09\
with words that are\
relevant for us today.\
4:13\
HE SAID: "You who are\
the wives and mothers\
4:18\
are the anchors of the family.\
4:21\
You bear the children.\
4:23\
What an enormous and sacred\
responsibility that is. ...\
4:27\
What is happening\
to our appreciation\
4:30\
of the sanctity of human life?\
4:34\
Abortion is an evil, stark\
and real and repugnant, which\
4:39\
is sweeping over the earth.\
4:41\
I plead with the women of\
this Church to shun it,\
4:45\
to stand above it, to stay\
away from those compromising\
4:49\
situations which make\
it appear desirable.\
4:52\
There may be some\
few circumstances\
4:55\
under which it can occur, but\
they are extremely limited.\
4:59\
...\
4:59\
You are the mothers of the\
sons and daughters of God,\
5:03\
whose lives are sacred.\
5:05\
Safeguarding them is a divinely\
given responsibility which\
5:10\
cannot be lightly\
brushed aside."\
5:16\
Elder Marcus B.\
Nash shared with me\
5:19\
the story of a dear\
84-year-old woman\
5:22\
who, during her\
baptismal interview,\
5:25\
"acknowledged an abortion\
[many years before]."\
5:29\
With heartfelt\
emotion, she said:\
5:32\
"I have carried the\
burden of having\
5:35\
aborted a child every day\
of my life for 46 years.\
5:39\
...\
5:40\
Nothing I did would take\
the pain and guilt away.\
5:45\
I was hopeless until I was\
taught the true gospel of Jesus\
5:49\
Christ.\
5:50\
I learned how to repent ...\
and suddenly I was filled with\
5:54\
hope.\
5:55\
I finally came to know that I\
could be forgiven if I truly\
6:00\
repented of my sins."\
6:03\
How grateful we are\
for the divine gifts\
6:06\
of repentance and forgiveness.\
6:10\
What is our responsibility\
as peaceful disciples\
6:13\
of Jesus Christ?\
6:14\
Let us live God's commandments,\
teach them to our children,\
6:19\
and share them with others\
who are willing to listen.\
6:23\
Let us share our deep\
feelings about the sanctity\
6:26\
of life with those who\
make decisions in society.\
6:30\
They may not fully\
appreciate what we believe,\
6:34\
but we pray that they\
will more fully understand\
6:38\
why, for us, these\
decisions go well\
6:42\
beyond just what a person\
wants for his or her own life.\
6:47\
If an unanticipated\
child is expected,\
6:50\
let us reach out with\
love, encouragement,\
6:53\
and, when needed,\
financial help,\
6:55\
strengthening a mother in\
allowing her child to be born\
6:59\
and continue his or her\
journey in mortality.\
7:06\
In our family, we have\
been immeasurably blessed\
7:10\
as two decades ago a\
young 16-year-old learned\
7:14\
that she was expecting a child.\
7:16\
She and the baby's\
father were not married,\
7:19\
and they could see no\
way forward together.\
7:22\
The young woman believed the\
life she was carrying was\
7:25\
precious.\
7:26\
She gave birth to a baby girl\
and allowed a righteous family\
7:30\
to adopt her as their own.\
7:33\
For Bryce and Jolinne, she was\
an answer to their prayers.\
7:38\
They named her\
Emily and taught her\
7:41\
to trust in her Heavenly Father\
and in His Son, Jesus Christ.\
7:46\
Emily grew up.\
7:48\
How grateful we are that Emily\
and our grandson Christian\
7:53\
fell in love and were married\
in the house of the Lord.\
7:58\
Emily and Christian now\
have their own little girl.\
8:02\
Emily recently wrote:\
"Throughout these last nine\
8:07\
months of pregnancy, I had time\
to reflect on the events [of]\
8:11\
my own birth.\
8:12\
I thought of my birth mother,\
who was just 16 years old.\
8:18\
As I experienced the aches and\
changes that pregnancy brings,\
8:22\
I couldn't help but imagine how\
difficult it would have been\
8:25\
at the young age of 16. ...\
8:26\
The tears flow even now as I\
think of my birth mother, who\
8:32\
knew she couldn't give me\
the life [she desired for me\
8:36\
and unselfishly placed]\
me for adoption.\
8:40\
I can't fathom what she\
might have gone through\
8:43\
in those nine\
months; being watched\
8:46\
with judging eyes as her body\
8:48\
changed, the teen\
experiences she\
8:51\
missed, knowing that at the\
end of this labor of motherly\
8:55\
love, she would place her\
child into the arms of another.\
9:00\
I am so thankful for\
her selfless choice,\
9:05\
that she did not choose to\
use her agency in a way that\
9:12\
would take away my own."\
9:15\
Emily concludes, "I'm so\
thankful for Heavenly Father's\
9:20\
divine plan, for my\
incredible parents\
9:23\
who [loved and cared\
for] me, and for temples\
9:27\
where we can be sealed to\
our families for eternity."\
9:32\
The Savior "took a child, and\
set him in the midst of them:\
9:37\
and when he had taken him into\
his arms, he said unto them,\
9:43\
"Whosoever shall receive one\
of [these] children in my name,\
9:47\
receiveth me."\
9:51\
I express my love and compassion\
for righteous couples who marry\
9:57\
and are unable to have the\
9:58\
children they so eagerly\
anticipate, and to those women\
10:03\
and men who have not had the\
10:04\
opportunity to marry\
according to God's law.\
10:08\
The unrealized\
dreams of life are\
10:11\
difficult to understand\
if viewed only\
10:14\
from the perspective\
of mortality.\
10:16\
As the Lord's\
servant, I promise you\
10:19\
that as you are\
faithful to Jesus\
10:21\
Christ and your covenants,\
you will receive compensating\
10:25\
blessings in this life\
and your righteous\
10:28\
desires in the eternal\
timeline of the Lord.\
10:32\
There can be happiness in\
the journey of mortality\
10:37\
even when all of our righteous\
hopes are not realized.\
10:42\
After birth, children\
continue to need our help.\
10:45\
Some need it desperately.\
10:47\
Each year, through\
caring bishops\
10:49\
and your generous\
contributions of fast offerings\
10:52\
and humanitarian funds, the\
10:55\
lives of millions and millions\
of children are blessed.\
10:58\
The First Presidency\
recently announced\
11:01\
an additional 20 million\
dollars to assist\
11:05\
UNICEF in their global\
efforts to administer\
11:08\
2 billion vaccines.\
11:10\
Children are loved by God.\
11:15\
It is concerning\
that even in some\
11:17\
of the most prosperous\
countries of the world,\
11:20\
fewer children are being born.\
11:23\
God's commandment\
for His children\
11:25\
to multiply and replenish\
the earth remains in force.\
11:29\
When to have a child and\
how many children to have\
11:34\
are private decisions to\
be made between a husband\
11:37\
and wife and the Lord.\
11:40\
With faith and prayer,\
these sacred decisions\
11:44\
can be beautiful,\
revelatory experiences.\
11:48\
I share the story of the Laing\
family of Southern California.\
11:52\
Sister Rebecca Laing writes:\
"In the summer of 2011,\
11:57\
life for our family\
was seemingly perfect.\
12:00\
We were happily married with\
four children-ages 9, 7, 5,\
12:04\
and 3. ...\
12:07\
"My pregnancies and deliveries\
[had been] high risk ...\
12:10\
[and] we felt [very] blessed\
to have four children,\
12:14\
[thinking] that our\
family was complete.\
12:18\
In October, while listening\
to general conference,\
12:21\
I felt an unmistakable\
feeling that we\
12:24\
were to have another baby.\
12:26\
As LeGrand and I\
pondered and prayed, ...\
12:29\
we knew that God had a different\
plan for us than we had\
12:33\
for ourselves.\
12:35\
"After another difficult\
pregnancy and delivery,\
12:39\
we were blessed with\
a beautiful baby girl.\
12:42\
We named her Brielle.\
12:44\
She was a miracle.\
12:46\
Moments after her birth, while\
still in [the delivery room],\
12:50\
I heard the unmistakable\
voice of the Spirit:\
12:54\
'There is one more.'\
12:58\
"Three years later,\
another miracle, Mia.\
13:04\
Brielle and Mia are a\
tremendous joy for our family."\
13:09\
She concludes, "Being open\
to the Lord's direction\
13:13\
and following His plan for\
us will always bring greater\
13:17\
happiness than... relying\
on our own understanding."\
13:22\
The Savior loves each\
precious child. "...\
13:25\
He took their little children,\
one by one, and blessed them.\
13:30\
...\
13:31\
"And ... they cast their\
eyes towards heaven, ...\
13:33\
and they saw angels\
descending out of heaven ...\
13:36\
in the midst of fire; and [the\
angels] encircled those little\
13:41\
ones about, ... and the angels\
did minister unto them."\
13:47\
I testify that your own personal\
journey as a child of God\
13:53\
did not begin for you as the\
first flow of earth's air\
13:57\
came rushing into your\
lungs, and it will not\
14:00\
end when you take your\
last breath of mortality.\
14:03\
May we always remember that\
each spirit child of God\
14:08\
is coming to earth on his\
or her own personal journey.\
14:13\
May we welcome them, safeguard\
them, and always love them.\
14:19\
As you receive these precious\
14:22\
children in the Savior's\
name and help them\
14:25\
in their eternal\
journey, I promise you\
14:29\
that the Lord will bless\
you and shower His love\
14:34\
and approval upon you.\
14:36\
In the name of Jesus Christ,\
14:38\
amen.\
