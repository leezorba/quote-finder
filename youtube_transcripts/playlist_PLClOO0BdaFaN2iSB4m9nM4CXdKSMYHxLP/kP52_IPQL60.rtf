isn't it fascinating how\
0:03\
significant scientific discoveries\
0:05\
sometimes are inspired by events as\
0:07\
simple as\
0:08\
an apple falling from a tree today\
0:12\
let me share a discovery that happened\
0:14\
because of a sample group of\
0:16\
rabbits in the 1970s\
0:19\
researchers set up an experiment to\
0:21\
examine the effects of diet\
0:23\
on heart health over several months they\
0:26\
fed a control group of rabbits\
0:28\
a high-fat diet and monitored their\
0:31\
blood pressure\
0:32\
heart rate and cholesterol as expected\
0:36\
many of the rabbits showed a build up\
0:38\
on the inside of their arteries yet this\
0:40\
was not all\
0:42\
researchers had discovered something\
0:44\
that made little sense\
0:46\
although all of the rabbits had a\
0:48\
buildup one group\
0:50\
surprisingly had as much as 60 percent\
0:53\
less than the others\
0:54\
it appeared as though they were looking\
0:56\
at two different groups\
0:58\
of rabbits to scientists results like\
1:01\
this\
1:02\
can cause lost sleep how could this be\
1:06\
the rabbits were all the same breed from\
1:09\
new zealand from a virtually identical\
1:11\
gene pool\
1:13\
they each received equal amounts of the\
1:16\
same food\
1:17\
what could this mean did the results\
1:20\
invalidate the study\
1:22\
were there flaws in the experiment\
1:24\
design the\
1:26\
scientists struggled to understand this\
1:28\
unexpected outcome\
1:31\
eventually they turned their attention\
1:32\
to the research staff\
1:34\
was it possible that researchers had\
1:36\
done something to\
1:38\
influence the results as they pursued\
1:41\
this they discovered that every rabbit\
1:43\
with fewer fatty deposits\
1:46\
had been under the care of one\
1:47\
researcher she fed the rabbits the same\
1:50\
as everyone else\
1:52\
but as one science scientist reported\
1:55\
she was an unusually kind and caring\
1:58\
individual\
1:59\
when she fed the rabbits she talked to\
2:01\
them cuddled and petted them\
2:04\
she couldn't help but it's just how she\
2:07\
was\
2:08\
she did more than simply give the\
2:10\
rabbits food she gave them\
2:12\
love at first glance it seemed unlikely\
2:15\
that this could be the reason for the\
2:17\
dramatic difference but the research\
2:19\
team could see no other possibility\
2:22\
so they repeated the experiment\
2:25\
this time tightly controlling for every\
2:28\
other variable\
2:30\
when they analyzed the results the same\
2:33\
thing happened\
2:34\
the rabbits under the care of the loving\
2:36\
researcher had significantly\
2:39\
higher health outcomes the scientists\
2:42\
published the results of this study in\
2:43\
the prestigious journal science\
2:46\
years later the findings of this\
2:48\
experiment still seem influential in the\
2:50\
medical community\
2:52\
in recent years dr kelly harding\
2:54\
published a book titled the rabbit\
2:56\
effect that takes\
2:57\
its name from the experiment her\
2:59\
conclusion\
3:00\
take a rabbit with an unhealthy\
3:02\
lifestyle\
3:03\
talk to it hold it give it affection the\
3:06\
relationship\
3:08\
made a difference ultimately\
3:11\
she concludes what affects our health in\
3:13\
the most\
3:14\
meaningful ways has as much to do with\
3:17\
how we\
3:18\
treat one another how we live and how we\
3:21\
think about what it means to be human\
3:25\
in a secular world bridges connecting\
3:27\
science with gospel truth sometimes seem\
3:30\
few and far between yet as christians\
3:33\
followers of jesus christ\
3:35\
latter-day saints the results of this\
3:38\
scientific study may seem more\
3:40\
intuitive than astonishing for me it\
3:43\
lays another brick in the foundation of\
3:45\
kindness\
3:47\
as a fundamental healing gospel\
3:49\
principle\
3:50\
one that can heal hearts emotionally and\
3:52\
spiritually\
3:54\
and as demonstrated here even physically\
3:57\
when asked master what is the great\
4:00\
commandment\
4:02\
the savior replied to love the lord thy\
4:04\
god with all thy heart\
4:06\
followed by thou shalt love thy neighbor\
4:09\
as thyself the savior's response\
4:13\
reinforces\
4:14\
our heavenly duty ancient prophets\
4:17\
commanded that\
4:18\
there should be no contention one with\
4:20\
another but that we should\
4:22\
look forward having our hearts knit\
4:24\
together\
4:25\
in unity and in love one towards another\
4:29\
we're further taught that power or\
4:31\
influence ought to be maintained by\
4:33\
gentleness and meekness\
4:35\
by kindness without guile i believe this\
4:39\
principle has a universal application to\
4:41\
all latter-day saints\
4:43\
adults youth and children\
4:47\
with that in mind let me speak directly\
4:49\
to you who are\
4:51\
primary age children for a moment\
4:54\
you already understand how important it\
4:56\
is to be kind\
4:58\
the chorus of one of your primary songs\
5:01\
i'm trying to be like jesus teaches\
5:04\
love one another as jesus loves you try\
5:07\
to show kindness in all that you do\
5:10\
be gentle and loving indeed and in\
5:12\
thought\
5:14\
for these are the things jesus taught\
5:17\
even still you may sometimes have a hard\
5:20\
time\
5:21\
here is a story that might help you\
5:24\
about a primary boy\
5:25\
named min chan kim from south korea\
5:30\
his family joined the church about six\
5:32\
years ago\
5:34\
quote one day at school one of my\
5:37\
a few of my classmates were making fun\
5:39\
of another student\
5:41\
by calling him names it looked like fun\
5:45\
so for a few weeks i joined in with them\
5:48\
several weeks later the boy told me even\
5:51\
though he\
5:52\
pretended he didn't care he was hurt by\
5:54\
our words and he cried\
5:57\
every night i almost cried when he told\
6:00\
me\
6:01\
i felt very sorry and wanted to help him\
6:05\
the next day i went up and put my arm\
6:08\
around his shoulder and apologized\
6:10\
saying\
6:11\
i'm really sorry that i made fun of you\
6:14\
he nodded at my words and his eyes\
6:17\
filled\
6:17\
up with tears but as the other kids were\
6:20\
still\
6:21\
but the other kids were still making fun\
6:23\
of him\
6:24\
then i remembered what i learned in\
6:26\
primary class\
6:28\
choose the right so i asked my\
6:30\
classmates to stop\
6:32\
most of them decided not to change and\
6:35\
they were mad at me\
6:37\
but one of the other boys said he was\
6:39\
sorry and the three of us\
6:41\
became good friends\
6:44\
even though a few people still made fun\
6:46\
of him he felt\
6:48\
better because he had us\
6:51\
i chose the right by helping\
6:54\
a friend in need close quote\
6:57\
isn't this a good example for you to try\
7:00\
to become like jesus\
7:03\
now for young men and young women as you\
7:06\
grow older\
7:08\
making fun of others can evolve very\
7:11\
dangerously\
7:13\
anxiety depression and worse are often\
7:16\
the companion of bullying\
7:17\
while bullying is not a new concept\
7:20\
social media and technology have brought\
7:22\
bullying to a new level\
7:24\
it becomes a more constant ever-present\
7:27\
threat\
7:28\
cyber bullying clearly the adversary is\
7:31\
using this to hurt your generation\
7:33\
there is no place for this in your\
7:35\
cyberspace neighborhood schools\
7:37\
quorums or classes please do all you can\
7:40\
to make these places kinder and safer\
7:43\
if you passively observe or participate\
7:46\
in any of this\
7:47\
i know of no better advice than that\
7:49\
previously given by\
7:51\
elder dieter f ucdorf quote when it\
7:53\
comes to hating gossiping ignoring\
7:56\
ridiculing holding grudges\
7:58\
or want to cause harm please apply the\
8:00\
following\
8:01\
stop it did you hear that stop it\
8:06\
as you extend yourself with kindness\
8:08\
care and compassion even digitally\
8:10\
i promise that you will lift up arms\
8:12\
that hang down\
8:13\
and will heal hearts having spoken to\
8:17\
primary children and youth i now direct\
8:19\
my remarks to\
8:20\
adults of the church we have a primary\
8:24\
responsibility to set a tone and be role\
8:26\
models of kindness\
8:28\
inclusion and civility to teach\
8:30\
christ-like behavior to the rising\
8:32\
generation\
8:33\
in what we say and how we act\
8:36\
it is especially important as we observe\
8:39\
a marked societal shift towards\
8:42\
division in politics social class and\
8:44\
nearly\
8:45\
every other man-made distinction\
8:48\
president m russell ballard has also\
8:51\
taught that latter-day saints must not\
8:53\
must\
8:54\
not only be kind to each other but also\
8:56\
to everyone around us\
8:59\
he observed quote occasionally i hear of\
9:02\
members offending those of other faiths\
9:04\
by overlooking them and leading\
9:05\
leaving them out this can occur\
9:08\
especially in communities\
9:09\
where our members are are the majority\
9:13\
i have heard about narrow-minded parents\
9:15\
who tell their children that they cannot\
9:17\
play with a particular child in the\
9:18\
neighborhood\
9:19\
simply because his or her family does\
9:22\
not belong to our church\
9:24\
this kind of behavior is not in keeping\
9:26\
with the teachings of the lord jesus\
9:28\
christ\
9:30\
i cannot comprehend why any member of\
9:32\
the church would follow these kinds\
9:34\
would allow these kinds of things to\
9:36\
happen\
9:37\
i have never heard members of this\
9:40\
church\
9:41\
urge to be anything but loving kind\
9:44\
tolerant and benevolent to our friends\
9:46\
and neighbors of other faiths\
9:48\
close quote the lord expects us to teach\
9:53\
that inclusion\
9:54\
is a positive means towards unity and\
9:56\
exclusion\
9:57\
leads to division as followers of jesus\
10:01\
christ we are dismayed when we hear of\
10:03\
how\
10:04\
children of god are mistreated based on\
10:06\
their race\
10:08\
we've been heartbroken to hear of recent\
10:10\
attacks on people who are\
10:12\
black asian latino or of any other group\
10:16\
prejudice racial tension or violence\
10:19\
should never have\
10:20\
any place in our neighborhoods\
10:22\
communities or\
10:23\
within the church let each of us no\
10:26\
matter our\
10:27\
age strive to be our best\
10:31\
as you strive to extend yourself in love\
10:33\
respect and kindness you will\
10:35\
undoubtedly be hurt or negatively\
10:37\
affected by the bad choices of others\
10:39\
what do we do then we follow the lord's\
10:43\
admonition to love your enemies and pray\
10:45\
for them which\
10:46\
despitefully use you we do all we can to\
10:49\
overcome the adversity that is placed in\
10:51\
our path\
10:52\
we strive to endure to the end all the\
10:55\
time praying that the hand of the lord\
10:57\
will\
10:58\
change our circumstances we offer\
11:00\
thanksgiving for those he places in our\
11:02\
path to assist us\
11:04\
i am moved by an example of this from\
11:07\
our early church history\
11:09\
during the winter of 1838 joseph smith\
11:12\
and other church leaders were detained\
11:14\
in liberty jail when the latter-day\
11:16\
saints were forcibly driven from their\
11:18\
homes in the state of missouri\
11:21\
the saints were destitute friendless and\
11:23\
suffering greatly from the cold and lack\
11:25\
of resources\
11:26\
the residents of quincy illinois saw\
11:28\
their desperate plight\
11:30\
and reached out in compassion and\
11:32\
friendship\
11:34\
wandell mace a resident of quincy later\
11:37\
recalled when he first saw the saints\
11:38\
along the mississippi river in\
11:41\
makeshift tents quote some had sheets\
11:44\
stretched to make a little shelter from\
11:46\
the wind\
11:47\
the children were shivering around a\
11:49\
fire which the wind blew about so it\
11:50\
done them very little good\
11:53\
the poor saints were suffering terribly\
11:56\
seeing the plight of the saints quincy\
11:58\
residents rallied together to provide\
12:01\
aid\
12:02\
some even assisting in transporting\
12:04\
their new friends across the river\
12:07\
mace continued they donated liberally\
12:10\
the merchants vine with each other\
12:12\
as to which could be the most liberal\
12:14\
with pork sugar shoes and clothing\
12:17\
everything so those poor out\
12:20\
those poor outcasts so much needed\
12:24\
before long the residents the refugees\
12:27\
outnumbered the quincy residents\
12:29\
who opened their homes and shared their\
12:32\
meager resources\
12:34\
at great personal sacrifice\
12:37\
many saints survived the harsh winter\
12:40\
only because of the compassion\
12:42\
and generosity of the residents of\
12:44\
quincy\
12:46\
these earthly angels opened their hearts\
12:48\
and homes\
12:49\
bringing life saved saving nourishment\
12:52\
warmth\
12:53\
and perhaps most importantly a hand of\
12:55\
friendship to the suffering saints\
12:58\
although their stay in quincy was\
13:00\
relatively short the saints never forgot\
13:02\
their debt of gratitude\
13:04\
toward their beloved neighbors and\
13:06\
quincy became known as\
13:08\
the city of refuge\
13:11\
when adversity infliction is brought\
13:14\
upon us by critical\
13:15\
negative even mean-spirited acts we can\
13:19\
choose to hope\
13:20\
in christ this hope comes from his\
13:23\
invitation and promise\
13:26\
to be of good cheer for i will lead you\
13:28\
along\
13:29\
and that he will consecrate your\
13:32\
afflictions\
13:33\
for your gain\
13:37\
let us conclude where we began a\
13:39\
compassionate caregiver\
13:41\
extending herself in kindness with a\
13:43\
nurturing spirit\
13:45\
and an unexpected outcome he leaned the\
13:48\
hearts of the animals over whom she had\
13:50\
stewardship\
13:52\
why because it was just how she was\
13:57\
as we look through a gospel lens we\
14:00\
recognize that we too are under the care\
14:02\
of a compassionate\
14:04\
caregiver who extends himself\
14:08\
in kindness and a nurturing spirit\
14:11\
the good shepherd knows each one of us\
14:13\
by name\
14:14\
and has a personal interest in us the\
14:17\
lord jesus christ said\
14:19\
i am the good shepherd and know my sheep\
14:22\
i will they\
14:23\
lay down my life for the sheep\
14:26\
on this holy easter weekend i find\
14:30\
abiding peace in knowing that\
14:32\
the lord is my shepherd and that each of\
14:35\
us is known by him\
14:37\
and under his watch care when we\
14:39\
confront life's wind and rainstorms\
14:41\
sickness and injuries the lord our\
14:43\
shepherd\
14:44\
our ki our caregiver will nourish us\
14:47\
with love and kindness\
14:48\
he will heal our hearts and restore our\
14:50\
souls\
14:51\
of this i testify and of jesus christ as\
14:54\
our savior and redeemer\
14:56\
in the name of jesus christ amen\
