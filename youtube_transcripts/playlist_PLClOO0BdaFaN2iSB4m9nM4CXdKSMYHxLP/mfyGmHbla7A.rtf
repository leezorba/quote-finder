The beautiful Latter-day Saint\
hymn "Hark, All Ye Nations!"\
0:04\
unmistakably captures the\
enthusiasm and exhilaration\
0:08\
of the fulness of the gospel\
going to all the world.\
0:12\
In this hymn we sing:\
0:14\
"Hark, all ye nations!\
0:16\
Hear heaven's voice\
0:18\
Thru ev'ry land that\
all may rejoice!\
0:21\
Angels of glory\
shout the refrain:\
0:24\
Truth is restored again!"\
0:28\
Louis F. Mönch, the author\
of this jubilant text,\
0:31\
was a German convert who wrote\
the inspired words for the hymn\
0:35\
while living in Switzerland\
during his full-time missionary\
0:38\
service in Europe.\
0:40\
The joy that springs\
from witnessing\
0:42\
the global impact\
of the Restoration\
0:45\
is clearly articulated in the\
following words of the hymn:\
0:50\
"Searching in darkness,\
nations have wept;\
0:54\
Watching for dawn, their\
vigil they've kept.\
0:57\
All now rejoice; the\
long night is o'er.\
1:01\
Truth is on earth once more!"\
1:05\
Thanks to the commencing\
of the ongoing Restoration\
1:07\
just over 200 years\
ago, the "gospel light\
1:11\
of truth and love" now shines\
brightly throughout the earth.\
1:15\
The Prophet Joseph\
learned in 1820,\
1:17\
and millions more\
have since learned,\
1:20\
that God "giveth to all men\
liberally, and upbraideth not."\
1:26\
Shortly after the\
organization of the Church\
1:28\
in this last dispensation,\
the Lord spoke to Joseph Smith\
1:33\
and manifested His abounding\
love for us when He said:\
1:38\
"Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing\
the calamity which should come\
1:42\
upon the inhabitants\
of the earth,\
1:44\
called upon my servant\
Joseph Smith, Jun.,\
1:47\
and spake unto him from heaven,\
and gave him commandments; ...\
1:51\
"That mine everlasting\
covenant might be established;\
1:54\
"That the fulness of\
my gospel might be\
1:56\
proclaimed by the weak\
and the simple unto\
1:59\
the ends of the world."\
2:02\
Soon after this\
revelation was received,\
2:04\
missionaries began\
to be called and sent\
2:07\
to many nations of the world.\
2:08\
Just as the prophet\
Nephi anticipated,\
2:12\
the message of the\
restored gospel\
2:14\
began to be preached "among\
all nations, kindreds, tongues,\
2:17\
and people."\
2:19\
"The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
2:21\
was formally organized in a\
small log cabin in upstate New\
2:26\
York in 1830.\
2:26\
"It took 117 years--until\
1947--for the Church to grow\
2:34\
from the initial six\
members to one million.\
2:38\
Missionaries were a\
feature of the Church\
2:40\
from its earliest days, fanning\
out to Native American lands,\
2:44\
to Canada and, in 1837, beyond\
the North American continent\
2:49\
to England.\
2:50\
Not long after,\
missionaries were\
2:52\
working on the\
European continent\
2:55\
and as far away as India\
and the Pacific Islands.\
2:59\
"The two-million-member mark\
was reached just 16 years later,\
3:04\
in 1963, and the three-million\
mark in eight years more."\
3:10\
Highlighting the rapid\
growth of the Church,\
3:13\
President Russell M.\
Nelson recently said:\
3:17\
"Today, the Lord's\
work in The Church\
3:20\
of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints\
3:22\
is moving forward at\
an accelerated pace.\
3:26\
The Church will have an\
unprecedented, unparalleled\
3:30\
future."\
3:34\
The Restoration of the fulness\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ,\
3:38\
the organization of the Lord's\
living Church on the earth\
3:41\
again, and its remarkable\
growth since then\
3:45\
have made the blessings of\
the priesthood available\
3:47\
throughout the earth.\
3:49\
Sacred ordinances and\
covenants that bind us to God\
3:53\
and set us on the\
covenant path clearly\
3:56\
manifest "the power\
of godliness."\
3:59\
As we participate in\
these sacred ordinances\
4:02\
for the living and\
for the dead, we\
4:04\
gather Israel on both\
sides of the veil\
4:07\
and prepare the earth for the\
Second Coming of the Savior.\
4:13\
In April 1973, my\
parents and I traveled\
4:16\
from our native Argentina\
to be sealed in the temple.\
4:20\
Since there were\
no temples in all\
4:22\
of Latin America at the time,\
we flew more than 6,000 miles\
4:26\
each way to be sealed\
in the Salt Lake Temple.\
4:30\
Although I was just two\
years of age at the time\
4:33\
and do not recall the entirety\
of that special experience,\
4:37\
three very distinct images from\
that trip were fixed in my mind\
4:41\
and have remained ever since.\
4:44\
First, I recall being placed\
close to the airplane's window\
4:48\
and seeing the\
white clouds below.\
4:52\
Those beautiful, bright\
clouds endure in my mind\
4:55\
as if they had been\
gigantic cotton balls.\
4:59\
Another image that has\
remained in my mind\
5:01\
is that of a few funny-looking\
characters at an amusement\
5:04\
park in the Los Angeles area.\
5:07\
Those characters\
are hard to forget.\
5:10\
But of much greater\
importance is\
5:12\
this brilliant and\
unforgettable image:\
5:15\
I clearly remember being in a\
sacred room of the Salt Lake\
5:19\
Temple, where sealings of\
couples and of families\
5:23\
are performed for time\
and for all eternity.\
5:26\
I remember the beautiful\
altar of the temple\
5:29\
and recall the bright sunlight\
shining through the room's\
5:33\
exterior window.\
5:34\
I felt then, and have\
continued to feel since,\
5:38\
the warmth, safety, and\
solace of the gospel\
5:43\
light of truth and love.\
5:46\
Similar feelings were reaffirmed\
in my heart 20 years later,\
5:49\
when I entered the temple to\
be sealed once again--this time\
5:54\
as my fiancée and I were sealed\
for time and for all eternity.\
5:58\
However, on this\
occasion, we did not\
6:01\
need to travel\
thousands of miles,\
6:03\
because the Buenos Aires\
Argentina Temple had since\
6:07\
been built and dedicated,\
and it was just\
6:10\
a short drive from our home.\
6:13\
Twenty-two years after\
our wedding and sealing,\
6:17\
we had the blessing of\
returning to the same temple,\
6:22\
but this time with our\
beautiful daughter,\
6:25\
and we were sealed as a family\
for time and for all eternity.\
6:31\
As I've reflected upon these\
very sacred moments of my life,\
6:34\
I have been overwhelmed\
with profound, enduring joy.\
6:38\
I felt then and have\
continued to feel\
6:42\
the love of a\
compassionate Father\
6:44\
in Heaven, who knows\
our individual needs\
6:48\
and our heartfelt desires.\
6:51\
In addressing the gathering\
of Israel in the last days,\
6:54\
the Lord Jehovah\
said, "I will put\
6:56\
my law in their inward parts,\
and write it in their hearts;\
7:01\
and will be their God, and\
they shall be my people."\
7:05\
I feel eternally grateful\
that from a young age\
7:09\
the law of the Lord started to\
be engraved deeply in my heart\
7:13\
through sacred ordinances\
in His holy house.\
7:17\
How fundamental it\
is to know that He\
7:21\
is our God, that\
we are His people,\
7:24\
and that whatever circumstances\
surround us, if we are faithful\
7:29\
and obey the covenants\
we've entered into,\
7:32\
we can be "encircled\
about eternally\
7:35\
in the arms of his love."\
7:38\
During the women's session of\
general conference in October\
7:41\
2019, President Nelson\
said, "All our efforts\
7:47\
to minister to each other,\
proclaim the gospel,\
7:50\
[and] perfect the Saints,\
and redeem the dead converge\
7:53\
in the holy temple."\
7:57\
Also, during the same\
general conference,\
7:59\
President Nelson\
taught: "Of course,\
8:02\
the crowning jewel of the\
Restoration is the holy temple.\
8:07\
Its sacred ordinances\
and covenants\
8:09\
are pivotal to\
preparing a people who\
8:12\
are ready to welcome the\
Savior at His Second Coming."\
8:17\
The ongoing Restoration\
has been marked\
8:20\
by the building and\
dedication of temples\
8:22\
at an augmented pace.\
8:25\
As we gather on both\
sides of the veil,\
8:28\
as we make sacrifices to serve\
and make the temple pivotal\
8:33\
in our lives, the Lord is truly\
building us--He is building His\
8:39\
covenant people.\
8:42\
"Oh, how glorious\
from the throne above\
8:46\
Shines the gospel light\
of truth and love!\
8:50\
Bright as the sun,\
this heavenly ray\
8:53\
Lights ev'ry land today."\
8:57\
I testify that the gospel\
light of truth and love\
8:59\
shines brightly throughout\
the earth today.\
9:01\
The "marvelous\
work and a wonder"\
9:04\
foretold by the prophet\
Isaiah and seen by Nephi\
9:09\
is taking place at\
a hastened pace,\
9:11\
even in these challenging times.\
9:14\
As Joseph Smith\
prophetically declared:\
9:17\
"The Standard of Truth\
has been erected;\
9:20\
no unhallowed hand can stop\
the work from progressing ...\
9:24\
till the purposes of God\
shall be accomplished,\
9:26\
and the Great Jehovah shall\
say the work is done."\
9:31\
Brothers and sisters, may we\
be willing and decide today\
9:35\
to engage ourselves\
and our families\
9:38\
in hearing heaven's voice,\
even the voice of our Savior.\
9:43\
May we make and keep\
covenants with God\
9:46\
which will secure us\
firmly in the path that\
9:49\
leads back to His\
presence, and may\
9:52\
we rejoice in the blessings\
of the glorious light\
9:55\
and truth of His gospel.\
9:58\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
