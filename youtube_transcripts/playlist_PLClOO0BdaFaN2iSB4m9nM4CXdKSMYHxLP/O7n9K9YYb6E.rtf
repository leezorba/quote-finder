Brothers and sisters,\
this Easter time\
0:04\
we focus on the glorious\
Resurrection of our Lord\
0:09\
and Savior, Jesus Christ.\
0:11\
We remember His loving\
invitation to "Come unto me,\
0:16\
all ye that labour\
and are heavy laden,\
0:19\
and I will give you rest.\
0:22\
Take my yoke upon\
you, and learn of me;\
0:26\
for I am meek and\
lowly in heart: and ye\
0:29\
shall find rest unto your souls.\
0:32\
For my yoke is easy,\
and my burden is light."\
0:37\
The Savior's invitation\
to come unto Him\
0:41\
is an invitation to all\
to not only come unto Him\
0:46\
but also to belong\
to His Church.\
0:50\
In the verse preceding\
this loving invitation,\
0:55\
Jesus teaches how this is\
done by seeking to follow Him.\
1:02\
He declared, "No man [or\
woman] knoweth the Son,\
1:09\
but the Father; neither\
knoweth any man the Father,\
1:15\
save the Son, and he [and\
I add or she] to whomsoever\
1:22\
the Son will reveal him."\
1:26\
Jesus wants us to know God\
is a loving Heavenly Father.\
1:31\
Knowing that we are loved by our\
1:34\
Heavenly Father\
will help us know\
1:38\
who we are and know that we\
belong to His great eternal\
1:42\
family.\
1:46\
THE MAYO CLINIC RECENTLY NOTED:\
"Having a sense of belonging is\
1:50\
so important. ...\
1:52\
Nearly every aspect of\
our lives is organized\
1:56\
around belonging to something."\
1:59\
This report adds, "We cannot\
2:02\
separate the\
importance of a sense\
2:04\
of belonging from our\
physical and mental health."\
2:10\
And I would add our\
spiritual health.\
2:14\
On the evening before His\
suffering in Gethsemane\
2:18\
and death on the cross, the\
Savior met with His disciples\
2:24\
for the Last Supper.\
2:25\
He said to them,\
"In the world ye\
2:29\
shall have tribulation:\
but be of good cheer;\
2:34\
I have overcome the world."\
2:38\
Before the sun set\
the following day,\
2:41\
Jesus had suffered and had "died\
[on the cross] for our sins."\
2:49\
I wonder how the lonely and\
faithful women and men who\
2:54\
followed Him must have felt in\
2:57\
Jerusalem as the sun set,\
and darkness and fear\
3:03\
encompassed them.\
3:05\
Like these ancient disciples\
nearly 2,000 years ago,\
3:10\
many of you may also feel\
lonely from time to time.\
3:14\
I have experienced\
this loneliness\
3:17\
since the death of my\
precious wife, Barbara,\
3:21\
over two and a half years ago.\
3:23\
I know what it is to be\
surrounded by family members,\
3:27\
friends, and associates but\
still feel lonely--because\
3:31\
the love of my life is\
no longer here beside me.\
3:38\
The COVID-19 pandemic\
has highlighted\
3:42\
this sense of isolation\
and loneliness for many.\
3:46\
Nevertheless, despite the\
challenges we face in life,\
3:51\
like that first Easter morning,\
we can awake to a new life\
3:56\
in Christ with new and marvelous\
possibilities and new realities\
4:03\
as we turn to the Lord\
for hope and belonging.\
4:08\
I personally feel\
the pain of those\
4:11\
who lack a sense of belonging.\
4:15\
As I watch news from time\
to time in the world,\
4:19\
I see many who seem to be\
experiencing this loneliness.\
4:23\
I think that, for many,\
it is because they may not\
4:28\
know that they are loved by\
4:30\
Heavenly Father and that we all\
belong to His eternal family.\
4:36\
Believing that God loves us\
and that we are His children\
4:41\
is comforting and assuring.\
4:44\
Because we are the\
spirit children of God,\
4:48\
everyone has a divine origin,\
nature, and potential.\
4:54\
Each of us is "a beloved\
spirit son or daughter\
4:59\
of heavenly parents."\
5:01\
This is our identity!\
5:04\
This is who we really are!\
5:08\
Our spiritual\
identity is enhanced\
5:11\
as we understand our\
many mortal identities,\
5:15\
including ethnic, cultural,\
or national heritage.\
5:21\
This sense of spiritual and\
cultural identity, love,\
5:26\
and belonging can inspire hope\
and love for Jesus Christ.\
5:33\
I speak of hope in Christ\
not as wishful thinking.\
5:39\
Instead, I speak of\
hope as an expectation\
5:45\
that will be realized.\
5:47\
Such hope is essential to\
overcoming adversity, fostering\
5:53\
spiritual resilience\
and strength,\
5:57\
and coming to know that we are\
loved by our Eternal Father\
6:02\
and that we are His children,\
who belong to His family.\
6:09\
When we have hope\
in Christ, we come\
6:11\
to know that as we need to\
make and keep sacred covenants,\
6:16\
our fondest desires and dreams\
can be fulfilled through Him.\
6:22\
The Quorum of the\
Twelve Apostles\
6:24\
have counseled together,\
in a spirit of prayer\
6:28\
and with a yearning\
to understand,\
6:31\
how to help all who feel alone\
or feel they don't belong.\
6:36\
We long to help all\
who feel this way.\
6:40\
Let me mention, in particular,\
those who currently are single.\
6:47\
Brothers and sisters,\
more than half\
6:50\
of the adults in the Church\
today are widowed, divorced,\
6:55\
or have not yet married.\
6:57\
Some wonder about their\
opportunities and place\
7:01\
in God's plan and in the Church.\
7:04\
We should understand that\
7:06\
eternal life is not\
simply a question\
7:09\
of current marital status but of\
discipleship and being "valiant\
7:16\
in the testimony of Jesus."\
7:19\
The hope of all who are single\
is the same as for all members\
7:25\
of the Lord's restored\
Church--access to the grace\
7:29\
of Christ through "obedience\
to the laws and ordinances\
7:34\
of the gospel."\
7:35\
May I suggest that there are\
some important principles\
7:39\
we need to understand.\
7:42\
First, scriptures and\
latter-day prophets\
7:47\
confirm that everyone who is\
faithful in keeping covenants\
7:52\
will have the opportunity\
for exaltation.\
7:55\
President Russell\
M. Nelson taught,\
7:59\
"In the Lord's own way\
and time, no blessing\
8:04\
will be withheld from\
His faithful Saints.\
8:07\
The Lord will judge and\
reward each individual\
8:14\
according to heartfelt\
desire as well as deed."\
8:21\
Second, the precise\
time and manner\
8:24\
in which the blessings of\
exaltation are to be bestowed\
8:30\
have not all been revealed, but\
they are nonetheless assured.\
8:35\
President Dallin\
H. Oaks explained\
8:39\
that some of the\
circumstances "of mortality\
8:43\
will be set right in\
the Millennium, which\
8:47\
is the time for\
fulfilling all that\
8:49\
is incomplete in the\
great plan of happiness\
8:53\
for all of our Father's worthy\
8:56\
children."\
8:58\
That doesn't mean that\
every blessing is deferred\
9:02\
until the Millennium; some have\
9:04\
already been received,\
and others will continue\
9:08\
to be received until that day.\
9:12\
Third, waiting upon the Lord\
implies continued obedience\
9:18\
and spiritual\
progress toward Him.\
9:22\
Waiting upon the Lord does\
not imply biding one's time.\
9:28\
You should never feel like\
you are in the waiting room.\
9:32\
Waiting upon the\
Lord implies action.\
9:35\
I have learned over the\
years that our hope in Christ\
9:39\
increases when we serve others.\
9:43\
Serving as Jesus\
served, we naturally\
9:47\
increase our hope in Him.\
9:51\
The personal growth\
one can achieve now\
9:55\
while waiting upon the\
Lord and His promises\
9:59\
is an invaluable, sacred element\
of His plan for each one of us.\
10:06\
The contributions\
one can make now\
10:09\
to help build up\
the Church on earth\
10:12\
and to gather Israel\
are much needed.\
10:16\
Marital status has nothing to\
do with one's capacity to serve.\
10:21\
The Lord honors those\
who serve and wait\
10:25\
upon Him in patience and faith.\
10:29\
Fourth, God offers eternal\
life to all His children.\
10:34\
All those who accept the\
Savior's gift of repentance\
10:39\
and live His commandments\
will receive eternal life,\
10:43\
even though they do not attain\
to all its characteristics\
10:49\
and perfections in mortality.\
10:53\
Those who repent will\
experience the Lord's readiness\
10:57\
to forgive as He\
has assured: "Yea,\
11:01\
and as often as my\
people repent will I\
11:06\
forgive them their\
trespasses against me."\
11:11\
In the final analysis, a\
person's capacity, desires,\
11:16\
and opportunities in matters\
of agency and choice,\
11:20\
including qualification\
for eternal blessings,\
11:25\
are matters only\
the Lord can judge.\
11:30\
Fifth, our confidence\
in these assurances\
11:35\
is rooted in our faith in\
Jesus Christ, by whose grace\
11:41\
all things pertaining to\
mortality are set right.\
11:46\
All promised blessings are\
made possible through Him\
11:52\
who, by His Atonement,\
"descended below all things"\
11:58\
and has "overcome the world."\
12:02\
He "hath sat down on\
the right hand of God,\
12:06\
to claim of the Father his\
rights of mercy which he hath\
12:11\
upon the children of men[;]\
... wherefore he advocateth\
12:16\
the cause of the\
children of men."\
12:20\
In the end, "the saints shall\
be filled with his glory,\
12:28\
and receive their inheritance"\
as "joint-heirs with Christ."\
12:35\
Our desire is that\
these principles\
12:39\
will help all have\
increased hope in Christ\
12:43\
and feel a sense of belonging.\
12:47\
Never forget that you are\
a child of God, our Eternal\
12:50\
Father, now and forever.\
12:54\
He loves you, and the\
Church wants and needs you.\
12:59\
Yes, we need you!\
13:02\
We need your voices,\
talents, skills, goodness,\
13:08\
and righteousness.\
13:10\
For many years, we have talked\
about "young single adults,"\
13:14\
"single adults," and "adults."\
13:16\
Those designations can\
be administratively\
13:20\
helpful at times but\
can inadvertently\
13:24\
change how we perceive others.\
13:27\
Is there a way to avoid\
this human tendency that can\
13:32\
separate us one from another?\
13:35\
President Nelson asked\
that we refer to ourselves\
13:39\
as members of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
13:44\
Saints.\
13:46\
That seems to cover\
all of us, doesn't it?\
13:51\
The gospel of Jesus Christ\
has the power to unite us.\
13:57\
We are ultimately more\
alike than we are different.\
14:01\
As members of God's family, we\
are truly brothers and sisters.\
14:08\
Paul stated, "And [God] hath\
made of one blood all nations\
14:13\
of men for to dwell on ...\
the face of the earth."\
14:19\
To you stake presidents,\
bishops, and quorum and sister\
14:22\
leaders, I ask you to\
consider every member\
14:26\
of your stake, ward,\
quorum, or organization\
14:30\
as members who can contribute\
and serve in callings\
14:36\
and participate in many ways.\
14:39\
Every member in our quorums,\
organizations, wards,\
14:43\
and stakes has God-given\
gifts and talents\
14:48\
that can help build\
up His kingdom now.\
14:52\
Let us call upon our members\
who are single to serve, lift,\
14:57\
and teach.\
14:58\
Disregard old notions and\
ideas that have sometimes\
15:03\
unintentionally contributed to\
their feelings of loneliness\
15:07\
and that they do not\
belong or cannot serve.\
15:12\
I bear my witness on this Easter\
weekend of our Savior Jesus\
15:17\
Christ and the eternal\
hope He gives me\
15:22\
and all who believe in His name.\
15:25\
And I bear this testimony\
humbly, in His sacred name,\
15:31\
even\
15:31\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
