In 2010, Andre Sebako was a\
young man seeking for truth.\
0:06\
Though he had never offered\
a heartfelt prayer before,\
0:10\
he decided to try.\
0:12\
Shortly afterward, he\
met the missionaries.\
0:15\
They gave him a pass-along\
card with a picture\
0:18\
of the Book of Mormon.\
0:19\
Andre felt something and\
asked if the missionaries\
0:23\
would sell him the book.\
0:25\
They said he could\
have the book for free\
0:27\
if he would come to church.\
0:30\
Andre attended the then\
recently created Mochudi Branch\
0:34\
in Botswana, Africa, alone.\
0:36\
But the branch was a\
loving, tight-knit group\
0:39\
consisting of about 40 members.\
0:42\
They welcomed Andre\
with open arms.\
0:45\
He received the missionary\
lessons and was baptized.\
0:49\
It was wonderful!\
0:52\
But then what?\
0:53\
How would Andre stay active?\
0:55\
Who would help him progress\
along the covenant path?\
0:59\
One answer to that question\
is his priesthood quorum!\
1:05\
Every priesthood holder,\
regardless of his situation,\
1:08\
benefits from a strong quorum.\
1:10\
My young brothers who hold\
the Aaronic Priesthood,\
1:14\
the Lord would have you\
establish a strong quorum,\
1:17\
a place of belonging for\
each and every young man,\
1:21\
a place where the Lord's\
Spirit is present,\
1:24\
a place where all quorum\
members are welcomed and valued.\
1:28\
As the Lord gathers\
His children,\
1:31\
they need a place\
to belong and grow.\
1:35\
Each of you quorum\
presidency members\
1:38\
lead the way as you\
seek inspiration\
1:40\
and develop love and brotherhood\
among all quorum members.\
1:44\
You give special\
attention to those\
1:47\
who are new members,\
who are less active,\
1:49\
or have special needs.\
1:51\
With priesthood power, you\
can build a strong quorum.\
1:55\
And a strong, united quorum\
makes all the difference\
1:59\
in the life of a young man.\
2:02\
When the Church announced\
the new home-centered focus\
2:05\
on gospel learning, some\
thought of members like Andre\
2:09\
and asked, "What about the young\
people who come from a family\
2:14\
situation where the\
gospel is not studied\
2:17\
and where there is not an\
environment of learning\
2:19\
and living the gospel at home?\
2:21\
Will they be left behind?"\
2:25\
No!\
2:26\
No one can be left behind!\
2:28\
The Lord loves each young\
man and each young woman.\
2:32\
We, as priesthood holders,\
are the Lord's hands.\
2:35\
We are the Church support\
to home-centered efforts.\
2:40\
When there is limited\
support at home,\
2:42\
priesthood quorums and\
other leaders and friends\
2:46\
watch over and support\
each individual and family\
2:50\
as needed.\
2:53\
I have seen it work.\
2:54\
I have experienced it.\
2:56\
When I was six, my\
parents divorced\
2:59\
and my father left my mother\
with five young children.\
3:02\
My mother began to\
work to provide for us.\
3:07\
She needed a second job\
for a period of time,\
3:09\
as well as additional education.\
3:11\
There was little time\
for her to nurture.\
3:14\
But grandparents, uncles,\
aunts, bishops, home teachers\
3:19\
stepped up to help\
my angel mother.\
3:23\
And I had a quorum.\
3:25\
I am so grateful for my\
friends--my brothers--who loved\
3:29\
and supported me.\
3:30\
My quorum was a\
place of belonging.\
3:33\
Some may have considered me\
a long shot and an underdog\
3:38\
because of my family situation.\
3:40\
Maybe I was.\
3:42\
But priesthood quorums\
changed those odds.\
3:46\
My quorum rallied around me and\
blessed my life immeasurably.\
3:52\
There are long shots and\
underdogs all around us.\
3:55\
Perhaps we all are,\
in one way or another.\
3:58\
But each of us\
here has a quorum,\
4:01\
a place where we can both\
receive strength and provide\
4:05\
strength.\
4:06\
The quorum is "all for\
one and one for all."\
4:10\
It is a place where we\
instruct each other,\
4:13\
serve others, and build\
unity and brotherhood\
4:16\
as we serve God.\
4:18\
It is a place where\
miracles happen.\
4:23\
I would like to\
tell you about some\
4:25\
of the miracles that occurred\
in Andre's quorum in Mochudi.\
4:29\
As I share this example,\
watch for principles\
4:32\
that strengthen every priesthood\
quorum that applies them.\
4:37\
After Andre was baptized, he\
accompanied the missionaries\
4:41\
as they taught four other young\
men, who were also baptized.\
4:46\
Now there were five young men.\
4:48\
They began strengthening\
each other and the branch.\
4:53\
A sixth young man,\
Thuso, was baptized.\
4:56\
Thuso shared the gospel\
with three of his friends,\
4:59\
and soon there were nine.\
5:02\
Disciples of Jesus Christ are\
often gathered this way--a few\
5:07\
at a time, as invited\
by their friends.\
5:10\
Anciently, when Andrew\
found the Savior,\
5:13\
he went quickly to\
his brother Simon\
5:15\
and "brought him to Jesus."\
5:17\
Similarly, soon after Philip\
became a follower of Christ,\
5:21\
he invited his friend\
Nathanael to "come and see."\
5:25\
In Mochudi, a 10th young\
man soon joined the Church.\
5:29\
The missionaries found the\
11th, and the 12th young man\
5:32\
was baptized after seeing the\
gospel's effect on his friends.\
5:37\
Members of the Mochudi\
Branch were thrilled.\
5:40\
These young men were "converted\
unto the Lord, and ...\
5:44\
united unto the church."\
5:47\
The Book of Mormon\
played a significant role\
5:49\
in their conversion.\
5:50\
Thuso remembers, "I began\
reading the Book of Mormon ...\
5:55\
every time I was free, at\
home, at school, everywhere."\
6:01\
Oratile was drawn to\
the gospel because\
6:03\
of the example of his friends.\
6:05\
He explains, "[They] seemed to\
change in the snap of a finger.\
6:09\
...\
6:10\
I thought it had ... to\
do with the little ...\
6:12\
book they started carrying\
around ... school.\
6:15\
I could see what good\
men they had become. ...\
6:18\
[I] wanted to change too."\
6:21\
All 12 young men were\
gathered and baptized\
6:24\
within two years of each other.\
6:26\
Each was the only member of\
the Church in his family.\
6:31\
But they were supported\
by their Church family,\
6:34\
including President Rakwela,\
their branch president;\
6:38\
Elder and Sister Taylor, a\
senior missionary couple;\
6:41\
and other branch members.\
6:43\
Brother Junior, a quorum\
leader, invited the young men\
6:47\
to his home on Sunday\
afternoons and mentored them.\
6:50\
The young men studied the\
scriptures together and held\
6:54\
regular family home evenings.\
6:58\
Brother Junior also\
taught them to visit\
7:00\
members, people being\
taught by the missionaries,\
7:04\
and anyone else\
who needed a visit.\
7:06\
All 12 young men piled into the\
back of Brother Junior's truck.\
7:12\
He dropped them off at homes in\
companionships of two or three\
7:16\
and picked them up later.\
7:18\
Even though the young men were\
just learning about the gospel\
7:22\
and didn't feel they\
knew much, Brother Junior\
7:26\
told them to share one or\
two things they did know\
7:29\
with the people they visited.\
7:31\
These young priesthood holders\
taught, prayed, and helped\
7:36\
watch over the Church.\
7:38\
They fulfilled their\
priesthood responsibilities\
7:41\
and experienced\
the joy of serving.\
7:45\
Andre said, "We played\
together, laughed together,\
7:49\
cried together, and\
became a brotherhood."\
7:53\
In fact, they called themselves\
"the Band of Brothers."\
7:58\
Together they set a goal that\
they would all serve missions.\
8:02\
Since they were the only\
members in their families,\
8:05\
they had many\
obstacles to overcome,\
8:08\
but they helped each\
other through them.\
8:11\
One by one, the young men\
received mission calls.\
8:14\
Those who left first\
wrote letters home\
8:17\
to those still preparing,\
sharing experiences\
8:21\
and encouraging them to serve.\
8:23\
Eleven of the young\
men served missions.\
8:27\
These young men shared the\
gospel with their families.\
8:31\
Mothers, sisters,\
brothers, friends,\
8:35\
as well as people they\
taught on their missions,\
8:38\
were converted and baptized.\
8:40\
Miracles occurred, and\
countless lives were blessed.\
8:47\
I can hear some of you\
thinking that perhaps such\
8:51\
a miracle could happen only\
in a place like Africa,\
8:54\
a fertile field where\
the gathering of Israel\
8:58\
is hastening.\
8:59\
However, I testify\
that the principles\
9:03\
applied in the Mochudi\
Branch are true anywhere.\
9:06\
Wherever you are, your quorum\
can grow through activation\
9:11\
and sharing the gospel.\
9:13\
When even one disciple\
reaches out to a friend,\
9:17\
one can become two.\
9:19\
Two can become four.\
9:21\
Four can become eight.\
9:23\
And eight can become twelve.\
9:24\
And branches can become wards.\
9:28\
The Savior taught, "Where two\
or three [or more] are gathered\
9:33\
together in my name, ... behold,\
there will I be in the midst\
9:37\
of them."\
9:38\
Heavenly Father is preparing\
the minds and hearts of people\
9:43\
all around us.\
9:44\
We can follow promptings,\
extend a hand of fellowship,\
9:49\
share truth, invite others\
to read the Book of Mormon,\
9:53\
and love and support them as\
they come to know our Savior.\
9:58\
It has been almost 10\
years since the Mochudi\
10:02\
Band of Brothers started\
their journey together,\
10:05\
and they are still\
a band of brothers.\
10:09\
Katlego said, "We may be\
separated by distance,\
10:13\
but we are still\
there for each other."\
10:17\
It is my prayer that we will\
accept the Lord's invitation\
10:21\
to be united with Him in\
our priesthood quorums\
10:25\
so that each quorum might\
be a place of belonging,\
10:29\
a place of gathering,\
a place that grows.\
10:34\
Jesus Christ is our Savior,\
and this is His work.\
10:38\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
