Earlier this morning,\
my wife's brother\
0:04\
gave her a note\
that she had written\
0:06\
to her mother many years ago.\
0:08\
In part, that note\
read, "Dear Mother,\
0:13\
I'm sorry I did not\
bear my testimony today.\
0:16\
But I love you.\
0:18\
Nancy."\
0:20\
As we went to lunch, I thought\
that was an interesting thing.\
0:23\
And I sat down and\
I wrote a note,\
0:27\
and it said, "Dear\
President Nelson,\
0:30\
I'm sorry I didn't give my\
talk today, but I love you."\
0:38\
And somehow that didn't feel\
right, and so here we are.\
0:43\
And I'm happy to add my\
words to those that have been\
0:47\
spoken in this session today.\
0:50\
Many years ago, I\
traveled on a small plane\
0:53\
with a newly certified\
pilot at the controls.\
0:56\
At the end of our flight,\
we were cleared to land.\
0:59\
But as we neared the ground, I\
heard an alarm in the cockpit\
1:02\
warn the pilot to "pull up."\
1:05\
The pilot looked to the\
more experienced copilot,\
1:08\
who pointed in a\
downward direction,\
1:10\
away from the runway,\
and said, "Now!"\
1:15\
Our plane rapidly moved\
to the left and down,\
1:18\
then climbed back to an\
appropriate altitude,\
1:21\
reentered the landing\
pattern, and arrived safely\
1:24\
at our destination.\
1:26\
We later learned\
that another aircraft\
1:28\
had been cleared for takeoff.\
1:30\
Had we followed the\
instructions of the alarm,\
1:33\
we would have veered into,\
rather than away from,\
1:35\
the oncoming plane.\
1:37\
This experience taught me\
two important lessons: First,\
1:42\
at critical moments\
in our lives,\
1:44\
we will hear multiple voices\
competing for our attention.\
1:48\
And second, it is vital that\
we listen to the right ones.\
1:54\
We live in a world with many\
voices seeking our attention.\
1:57\
With all the breaking news,\
tweets, blogs, podcasts,\
2:01\
and compelling advice from\
Alexa, Siri, and others,\
2:05\
we can find it difficult to\
know which voices to trust.\
2:09\
Sometimes we crowdsource\
guidance in our lives,\
2:13\
thinking the\
majority will provide\
2:14\
the best source of truth.\
2:16\
Other times we "halt ...\
between two opinions,"\
2:18\
choosing to be\
"neither cold nor hot."\
2:21\
Still other times we\
follow what is convenient,\
2:23\
focus on a single voice\
or issue to guide us,\
2:27\
or rely exclusively upon\
our own ability to think.\
2:32\
While each of these\
approaches can be helpful,\
2:34\
experience teaches that they\
are not always reliable.\
2:37\
What is popular is not\
always what is best.\
2:41\
Halting between two opinions\
brings no direction.\
2:45\
Convenience rarely leads\
to things that matter.\
2:49\
Fixation on a single\
voice or issue\
2:51\
can impair our ability to see.\
2:54\
And relying solely\
upon our own thinking\
2:57\
can lead us into a\
hyper-intellectual stupor\
3:00\
of thought.\
3:01\
If we are not careful,\
the wrong voices\
3:04\
can draw us away from\
the gospel center\
3:07\
to places where faith\
is difficult to sustain,\
3:10\
and we find little more\
than emptiness, bitterness,\
3:13\
and dissatisfaction.\
3:15\
Let me demonstrate what I\
mean by using an analogy\
3:19\
and a scriptural example.\
3:21\
Mountain climbers commonly\
refer to altitudes\
3:24\
above 8,000 meters as the "death\
zone" because at those heights,\
3:28\
there is not enough\
oxygen to sustain life.\
3:31\
There is a spiritual\
equivalent to the death zone.\
3:35\
If we spend too much\
time in faithless places,\
3:39\
seemingly well-intended\
voices deprive us\
3:42\
of the spiritual oxygen we need.\
3:45\
In the Book of Mormon,\
we read of Korihor,\
3:47\
who had such an experience.\
3:49\
He enjoyed great popularity\
because his teachings\
3:51\
were "pleasing [to]\
the carnal mind."\
3:53\
He said that\
parents and prophets\
3:56\
teach foolish\
traditions designed\
3:58\
to limit freedom and\
perpetuate ignorance.\
4:01\
He argued that people should be\
free to do whatever they choose\
4:05\
because commandments are\
nothing more than conveniently\
4:07\
contrived restrictions.\
4:10\
To him, belief in the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ\
4:13\
was "the effect of a frenzied\
mind," created by belief\
4:16\
in a being who could not exist\
because He could not be seen.\
4:21\
Korihor created so\
much unrest that he\
4:23\
was brought before the chief\
judge and the high priest.\
4:27\
There he rose "up in\
great swelling words,"\
4:30\
criticizing the leaders\
and demanding a sign.\
4:33\
A sign was given.\
4:35\
He was struck so that\
he could not speak.\
4:38\
Korihor then realized\
that he had been deceived,\
4:41\
and thinking of precious\
truths that he had abandoned,\
4:44\
he lamented, "I always knew."\
4:48\
Korihor then begged for food\
until he was trampled to death\
4:51\
by a group of Zoramites.\
4:53\
The final verse in his story\
contains this sober reflection:\
4:57\
"And thus we see that\
the devil will not\
4:59\
support his children\
at the last day,\
5:02\
but doth speedily drag\
them down to hell."\
5:06\
Because our Heavenly\
Father wants better for us,\
5:09\
He makes it possible for\
us to hear His voice.\
5:12\
Most often, we hear\
Him through impressions\
5:14\
given by the Holy Ghost.\
5:16\
The Holy Ghost is the third\
member of the Godhead.\
5:19\
He witnesses of the\
Father and the Son,\
5:22\
was sent to "teach\
[us] all things,"\
5:25\
and will "show unto [us] all\
things what [we] should do."\
5:29\
The Spirit speaks to different\
people in different ways,\
5:32\
and He may speak to the same\
person in different ways\
5:35\
at different times.\
5:37\
As a result, learning the\
many ways He speaks to us\
5:40\
is a lifelong quest.\
5:42\
Sometimes He speaks to our\
"mind and in [our] heart"\
5:45\
in a voice that is\
small yet powerful,\
5:48\
piercing "them that ...\
hear to the center."\
5:51\
Other times, His impressions\
"occupy [our] mind[s]"\
5:54\
or "press ... upon\
[our] feelings."\
5:56\
Other times our bosom\
will "burn within [us]."\
6:00\
Still other times, He\
fills our souls with joy,\
6:03\
enlightens our minds, or speaks\
peace to our troubled hearts.\
6:08\
We will find our Father's\
voice in many places.\
6:11\
We will find it when we pray,\
when we study the scriptures,\
6:14\
and when we attend church,\
engage in faithful discussions,\
6:18\
or go to the temple.\
6:20\
Surely we will find it in\
conference this very weekend.\
6:25\
Today we sustained 15\
men as prophets, seers,\
6:28\
and revelators.\
6:29\
Their spirituality\
and experience\
6:31\
give them a unique perspective\
that we desperately need.\
6:35\
Their messages are\
easy to find and spoken\
6:37\
with absolute clarity.\
6:39\
They tell us what God wants us\
to know, whether it is popular\
6:43\
or not.\
6:45\
Seeking His voice in any\
one of these places is good,\
6:48\
but seeking it in many\
of them is even better.\
6:51\
And when we hear it,\
we need to follow\
6:53\
the direction that is given.\
6:54\
The Apostle James said,\
"Be ye doers of the word,\
6:58\
and not hearers only."\
7:00\
And President Thomas S.\
Monson once taught: "We watch.\
7:03\
We wait.\
7:04\
We listen for that\
still, small voice.\
7:07\
When it speaks, wise\
men and women obey."\
7:12\
Early in my professional\
life, Sister Homer and I\
7:14\
were asked to accept a\
change in job assignment.\
7:17\
At the time, it seemed\
to us a huge decision.\
7:20\
We studied, we\
fasted, and we prayed,\
7:23\
but an answer was slow to come.\
7:25\
Eventually, we made a\
decision and pressed forward.\
7:29\
As we did, we felt\
settled and soon\
7:31\
learned that it was one of\
the best decisions we had ever\
7:33\
made.\
7:35\
As a result, we have learned\
that answers are sometimes\
7:38\
slow to come.\
7:39\
This can be because it\
is not the right time,\
7:42\
because an answer is not\
needed, or because God trusts us\
7:46\
to make the decision ourselves.\
7:48\
Elder Richard G. Scott once\
taught that we should be\
7:51\
grateful for such times\
and made this promise:\
7:53\
"When you are living your life\
worthily and your choice is\
7:56\
consistent with the Savior's\
teachings and you need to act,\
7:59\
proceed with trust. ...\
8:01\
God will not let you proceed\
too far without a warning\
8:04\
impression if you have\
made the wrong decision."\
8:06\
We must choose.\
8:07\
And so we need to decide which,\
among all the different voices,\
8:11\
we will obey.\
8:13\
Will we follow the unreliable\
voices advocated by the world,\
8:17\
or will we do the work required\
to allow our Father's voice\
8:20\
to guide us in our decisions\
and protect us from danger?\
8:24\
The more diligently\
we seek His voice,\
8:27\
the easier it becomes to hear.\
8:29\
It is not that His\
voice gets louder\
8:32\
but that our ability to\
hear it has increased.\
8:36\
The Savior has promised\
that if we "hearken\
8:39\
unto [His] precepts, and lend\
an ear unto [His] counsel,"\
8:43\
He "will give [us] more."\
8:45\
I testify that this promise\
is true--for each of us.\
8:49\
Nearly a year ago we\
lost my older brother\
8:52\
in a tragic automobile accident.\
8:54\
John's early years were full\
of promise and accomplishment.\
8:58\
But as he grew older, a broken\
body and uncooperative mind\
9:02\
made life very difficult.\
While the healing he hoped for\
9:07\
didn't come in this\
life, John nonetheless\
9:09\
held to his faith, determined\
to endure, as best he could,\
9:12\
to the end.\
9:14\
Now, I know that\
John was not perfect,\
9:16\
but I have wondered what it was\
that gave him such endurance.\
9:21\
Many voices invited him\
into the cynical fringe,\
9:24\
but he chose not to go.\
9:26\
Instead, he did his best to\
anchor his life at the gospel\
9:30\
center.\
9:31\
He lived his life\
there because he\
9:33\
knew he would find the\
voice of his Master there;\
9:35\
he lived his life there\
because he knew it was there\
9:39\
that he would be taught.\
9:42\
Brothers and sisters, in a world\
with so many competing voices,\
9:45\
I testify that our Heavenly\
Father has made it possible\
9:48\
for us to hear and follow His.\
9:50\
If we are diligent,\
He and His Son\
9:54\
will give us the direction we\
seek, the strength we need,\
9:58\
and the happiness we all desire.\
10:00\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
