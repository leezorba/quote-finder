In mortality we are\
subject to the laws of man\
0:04\
and the laws of God.\
0:07\
I have had the unusual\
experience of judging serious\
0:12\
misbehavior under both of these\
laws--earlier as a justice\
0:18\
of the Utah Supreme Court and\
now as a member of the First\
0:22\
Presidency.\
0:24\
The contrast I have experienced\
between the laws of man\
0:29\
and the laws of God has\
increased my appreciation\
0:33\
for the reality and power of\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
0:40\
Under the laws of man, a person\
guilty of the most serious\
0:44\
crimes can be sentenced\
to life in prison\
0:48\
without possibility of parole.\
0:52\
But it is different under\
the merciful plan of a loving\
0:56\
Heavenly Father.\
0:57\
I have witnessed that\
these same serious sins can\
1:02\
be forgiven in mortality\
because of our Savior's atoning\
1:07\
sacrifice for the\
sins of "all those\
1:11\
who have a broken heart\
and a contrite spirit."\
1:15\
Christ redeems, and\
His atonement is real.\
1:22\
The loving compassion\
of our Savior\
1:24\
is expressed in the great hymn\
just performed by the choir:\
1:28\
"Come unto Jesus;\
he'll ever heed you,\
1:33\
Though in the darkness\
you've gone astray.\
1:37\
His love will find you\
and gently lead you\
1:41\
From darkest night into day."\
1:46\
The atoning sacrifice\
of Jesus Christ\
1:49\
opens the door for "all men\
[to] repent and come unto him."\
1:55\
The book of Alma reports\
repentance and forgiveness\
2:00\
even of those who\
had been a wicked\
2:03\
and a bloodthirsty people.\
2:05\
My message today is one\
of hope for all of us,\
2:10\
including those who have lost\
their membership in the Church\
2:14\
by excommunication\
or name removal.\
2:17\
We are all sinners who can\
be cleansed by repentance.\
2:25\
"To repent from\
sin is not easy,"\
2:27\
Elder Russell M. Nelson taught\
in a prior general conference,\
2:31\
"but the prize is\
worth the price."\
2:36\
Repentance begins\
with our Savior,\
2:39\
and it is a joy, not a burden.\
2:41\
In last December's\
Christmas devotional,\
2:44\
President Nelson taught: "True\
repentance is not an event.\
2:49\
It is a never-ending privilege.\
2:52\
It is fundamental to\
progression and having peace\
2:56\
of mind, comfort, and joy."\
3:01\
Some of the greatest\
teachings on repentance are\
3:04\
in Alma's Book of Mormon sermon\
to members of the Church whom\
3:09\
he later described as having\
been in a state of "much\
3:13\
unbelief," "lifted\
up in ... pride,"\
3:16\
and with hearts set "upon\
riches and the vain things\
3:21\
of the world."\
3:22\
Each member of this\
restored Church\
3:25\
has much to learn from\
Alma's inspired teachings.\
3:31\
We begin with faith\
in Jesus Christ\
3:34\
because "it is he that\
cometh to take away\
3:38\
the sins of the world."\
3:40\
We must repent because,\
as Alma taught,\
3:44\
"except ye repent\
ye can in nowise\
3:48\
inherit the kingdom of heaven."\
3:51\
Repentance is an essential\
part of God's plan.\
3:55\
Because all would sin\
in our mortal experience\
3:59\
and be cut off from\
God's presence,\
4:02\
man could not be saved\
without repentance.\
4:09\
This has been taught\
from the beginning.\
4:11\
The Lord commanded\
Adam, "Teach it\
4:13\
unto your children, that all\
men, everywhere, must repent,\
4:17\
or they can in nowise\
inherit the kingdom of God,\
4:22\
for no unclean thing\
can dwell there,\
4:25\
or dwell in his presence."\
4:30\
We must repent of all our\
sins--all of our actions\
4:34\
or inactions contrary to\
the commandments of God.\
4:38\
No one is exempt.\
4:41\
Just last evening\
President Nelson\
4:43\
challenged us, "Brethren,\
we all need to repent."\
4:51\
To be cleansed by repentance,\
we must forsake our sins\
4:55\
and confess them to the\
Lord and to His mortal judge\
4:59\
where required.\
5:01\
Alma taught that we must\
also "bring forth works\
5:05\
of righteousness."\
5:07\
All of this is part of the\
frequent scriptural invitation\
5:11\
to come unto Christ.\
5:16\
We need to partake of the\
sacrament each Sabbath day.\
5:20\
In that ordinance we make\
covenants and receive blessings\
5:24\
that help us overcome all\
acts and desires that block us\
5:29\
from the perfection our\
Savior invites us to achieve.\
5:33\
As we "deny [ourselves] of\
all ungodliness, and love God\
5:39\
with all [our] might, mind\
and strength," then we\
5:44\
may be "perfect\
in Christ" and be\
5:47\
"sanctified" through the\
shedding of His blood,\
5:50\
to "become holy, without spot."\
5:53\
What a promise!\
5:56\
What a miracle!\
5:57\
What a blessing!\
6:01\
One purpose of God's plan\
for this mortal experience\
6:04\
is to "prove" us\
"to see if [we] will\
6:06\
do all things whatsoever\
the Lord [our] God\
6:10\
shall command [us]."\
6:11\
As part of this plan, we\
are accountable to God\
6:16\
and to His chosen servants,\
and that accountability\
6:20\
involves both mortal\
and divine judgments.\
6:26\
In the Lord's Church,\
mortal judgments\
6:28\
for members or\
prospective members\
6:31\
are administered by leaders\
who seek divine direction.\
6:36\
It is their responsibility\
to judge persons\
6:40\
who are seeking to come\
unto Christ to receive\
6:43\
the power of His Atonement\
on the covenant path\
6:47\
to eternal life.\
6:49\
Mortal judgments\
determine whether a person\
6:52\
is ready for baptism.\
6:54\
Is a person worthy of a\
recommend to attend the temple?\
6:59\
Has a person whose\
name was removed\
7:01\
from the records of the\
Church repented sufficiently\
7:05\
through the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ\
7:08\
to be readmitted by baptism?\
7:12\
When a mortal\
judge called of God\
7:14\
approves a person\
for further progress,\
7:17\
such as temple\
privileges, he is not\
7:21\
signifying that\
person as perfect,\
7:23\
and he is not\
forgiving any sins.\
7:27\
Elder Spencer W. Kimball\
taught that after what\
7:30\
he called the mortal\
"waiving [of] penalties,"\
7:34\
a person "must also seek and\
secure from the God of heaven\
7:40\
a final repentance, and\
only he can absolve."\
7:48\
And if sinful acts and\
desires remain unrepented\
7:52\
until the Final Judgment,\
an unrepentant person\
7:57\
will remain unclean.\
7:59\
The ultimate accountability,\
including the final cleansing\
8:04\
effect of repentance, is\
between each of us and God.\
8:12\
The judgment most commonly\
described in the scriptures\
8:15\
is the Final Judgment that\
follows the Resurrection.\
8:20\
Many scriptures state\
that "we shall all\
8:23\
stand before the\
judgment seat of Christ,"\
8:26\
"to be judged according\
to the deeds [that] have\
8:29\
been done in the mortal body."\
8:32\
All will be judged\
"according to their works"\
8:36\
and "according to the\
desire[s] of their hearts."\
8:42\
The purpose of\
this Final Judgment\
8:43\
is to determine whether we have\
achieved what Alma described\
8:47\
as a "mighty change of\
heart," where we have become\
8:51\
new creatures, with "no\
more disposition to do evil,\
8:54\
but to do good continually."\
8:57\
The judge of this is our\
Savior, Jesus Christ.\
9:02\
After His judgment, we will all\
confess "that his judgments are\
9:08\
just," because His\
omniscience has given Him\
9:13\
a perfect knowledge\
of all our acts\
9:16\
and desires, both those\
righteous or repented\
9:20\
and those unrepented\
or unchanged.\
9:25\
The scriptures describe the\
process of this Final Judgment.\
9:30\
Alma teaches that the\
justice of our God\
9:34\
requires that in the\
Resurrection "all\
9:37\
things should be restored\
to their proper order."\
9:41\
This means that "if their\
works were good in this life,\
9:46\
and the desires of their\
hearts were good, ...\
9:49\
at the last day [they\
will] be restored unto\
9:52\
that which is good."\
9:54\
Similarly, "if their\
works [or their desires]\
10:00\
are evil they shall be\
restored [to] them for evil."\
10:05\
Similarly, the\
prophet Jacob taught\
10:08\
that in the Final Judgment\
"they who are righteous\
10:11\
shall be righteous still,\
and they who are filthy\
10:14\
shall be filthy still."\
10:16\
That is the process\
preceding our standing\
10:21\
before what Moroni\
calls "the pleasing bar\
10:26\
of the great Jehovah,\
the Eternal Judge\
10:29\
of both quick and dead."\
10:33\
To assure that we will\
be clean before God,\
10:36\
we must repent before\
the Final Judgment.\
10:40\
As Alma told his sinful son,\
we cannot hide our sins before\
10:45\
God, "and except ye repent\
they will stand as a testimony\
10:51\
against you at the last day."\
10:55\
The Atonement of Jesus\
Christ gives us the only way\
10:58\
to achieve the needed\
cleansing through repentance,\
11:03\
and this mortal life\
is the time to do it.\
11:07\
Although we are taught\
that some repentance can\
11:11\
occur in the spirit world,\
that is not as certain.\
11:14\
Elder Melvin J. Ballard\
taught: "It is much easier\
11:19\
to overcome and serve the Lord\
when both flesh and spirit are\
11:23\
combined as one.\
11:25\
This is the time when men are\
more pliable and susceptible.\
11:30\
...\
11:30\
This life is the\
time to repent."\
11:36\
When we repent, we have\
the Lord's assurance\
11:39\
that our sins, including\
our acts and desires,\
11:44\
will be cleansed, and\
our merciful final judge\
11:48\
will "remember them no more."\
11:51\
Cleansed by repentance, we\
can qualify for eternal life,\
11:56\
which King Benjamin described as\
"dwell[ing] with God in a state\
12:00\
of never-ending happiness."\
12:04\
As another part of God's\
"plan of restoration,"\
12:07\
the Resurrection will\
restore "all things ...\
12:11\
to their proper\
and perfect frame."\
12:13\
This includes the perfection of\
all of our physical deformities\
12:19\
and deficiencies\
acquired in mortality,\
12:23\
including at birth or\
by trauma or disease.\
12:28\
Does this restoration\
perfect us of\
12:32\
all our unholy or unconquered\
desires or addictions?\
12:38\
That cannot be.\
12:40\
We know from modern\
revelation we\
12:43\
will be judged for our desires\
as well as our actions,\
12:47\
and that even our\
thoughts will condemn us.\
12:52\
We must not "procrastinate\
the day of [our] repentance"\
12:56\
until death, Amulek taught,\
because the same spirit that\
13:01\
has possessed our body\
in this life--whether\
13:04\
the Lord's or the devil's--"will\
have power to possess [our]\
13:09\
body in that eternal world."\
13:12\
Our Savior has the\
power and stands\
13:15\
ready to cleanse us from evil.\
13:18\
Now is the time to\
seek His help to repent\
13:22\
of our wicked or unseemly\
desires and thoughts,\
13:26\
to be clean and prepared\
to stand before God\
13:30\
at the Final Judgment.\
13:34\
Overarching God's plan and all\
of His commandments is His love\
13:38\
for each of us, which is "most\
desirable above all things ...\
13:43\
and the most joyous\
to the soul."\
13:45\
The prophet Isaiah assured\
even the wicked that when they\
13:50\
"return unto the Lord ...\
he will have mercy ...\
13:53\
[and] abundantly pardon."\
13:55\
Alma taught, "Behold, he sendeth\
an invitation unto all men,\
14:01\
for the arms of mercy are\
extended towards them."\
14:05\
The risen Lord\
told the Nephites:\
14:08\
"Behold, mine arm of mercy\
is extended towards you,\
14:12\
and whosoever will come,\
him will I receive."\
14:16\
From these and many other\
scriptural teachings\
14:20\
we know that our loving\
Savior opens His arms\
14:23\
to receive all men and women,\
on the loving conditions\
14:27\
He has prescribed, to enjoy\
the greatest blessings\
14:32\
God has for His children.\
14:36\
Because of God's plan and the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ,\
14:40\
I testify with a "perfect\
brightness of hope"\
14:44\
that God loves us and\
we can be cleansed\
14:48\
by the process of repentance.\
14:51\
We are promised that "if\
[we] press forward, feasting\
14:55\
upon the word of Christ, and\
endure to the end, behold,\
14:59\
thus saith the Father: Ye\
shall have eternal life."\
15:04\
May we all do so,\
I plead and pray,\
15:08\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
