My dear brothers and\
sisters, what a great joy\
0:04\
it is to be here together again\
in this general conference\
0:10\
for The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day\
0:12\
Saints under the direction of\
our beloved prophet, President\
0:17\
Russell M. Nelson.\
0:18\
I testify to you that we will\
have the privilege of hearing\
0:23\
the voice of our\
Savior Jesus Christ\
0:26\
through the teachings of those\
who pray, sing, and speak\
0:30\
to the needs of our\
day in this conference.\
0:34\
As recorded in the book of\
Acts, Philip the Evangelist\
0:38\
taught the gospel to\
a certain Ethiopian\
0:42\
who was a eunuch in charge of\
all the treasures belonging\
0:46\
to the queen of Ethiopia.\
0:48\
While returning from\
worshipping in Jerusalem,\
0:52\
he read the book of Isaiah.\
0:54\
Compelled by the Spirit,\
Philip came closer to him\
0:59\
and said, "Understandest\
thou what thou readest?\
1:05\
"And [the eunuch]\
said, How can I,\
1:08\
except some man\
should guide me? ...\
1:11\
"Then Philip opened\
his mouth, and began\
1:14\
at the same scripture, and\
preached unto him Jesus."\
1:21\
The question asked\
by this Ethiopian man\
1:24\
is a reminder of the\
divine mandate we all\
1:28\
have to seek to learn\
and to teach one another\
1:32\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
1:34\
In fact, in the context\
of learning and teaching\
1:38\
the gospel, we are sometimes\
like the Ethiopian:\
1:42\
we need the help of a\
faithful and inspired teacher.\
1:46\
And we are sometimes\
like Philip:\
1:48\
we need to teach and strengthen\
others in their conversion.\
1:53\
Our purpose as we seek\
to learn and to teach\
1:56\
the gospel of Jesus\
Christ must be\
1:59\
to increase faith in God and\
in His divine plan of happiness\
2:03\
and in Jesus Christ and\
His atoning sacrifice\
2:07\
and to achieve\
lasting conversion.\
2:10\
Such increased faith and\
conversion will help us make\
2:15\
and keep covenants with God,\
thus strengthening our desire\
2:19\
to follow Jesus and\
producing a genuine spiritual\
2:23\
transformation in\
us--in other words,\
2:26\
transforming us\
into a new creature,\
2:29\
as taught by the Apostle Paul in\
his epistle to the Corinthians.\
2:34\
This transformation will bring\
us a more happy, productive,\
2:40\
and healthy life and\
help us to maintain\
2:44\
an eternal perspective.\
2:46\
Isn't this exactly what\
happened to the Ethiopian eunuch\
2:50\
after he learned\
about the Savior\
2:52\
and was converted to His gospel?\
2:56\
The scripture says that "he\
went on his way rejoicing."\
3:04\
The commandment to\
learn the gospel\
3:06\
and teach it to one\
another is not new;\
3:08\
it has been constantly\
repeated from the beginning\
3:12\
of human history.\
3:14\
On one particular occasion,\
while Moses and his people\
3:18\
were in the plains of Moab\
before entering the promised\
3:22\
land, the Lord inspired him to\
admonish his people concerning\
3:27\
their responsibility to learn\
the statutes and covenants they\
3:32\
had received from the\
Lord and to teach them\
3:35\
to their posterity, many of whom\
had not personally experienced\
3:41\
the crossing of the Red\
Sea or the revelation\
3:44\
given on the Mount Sinai.\
3:48\
MOSES ADMONISHED HIS\
PEOPLE: "Hearken, O Israel,\
3:52\
unto the statutes and unto the\
judgments, which I teach you,\
3:57\
for to do them,\
that ye may live,\
4:00\
and go in and possess\
the land which the Lord\
4:03\
God of your father giveth you.\
4:06\
...\
4:06\
"...\
4:07\
Teach them thy sons,\
and thy sons' sons."\
4:12\
Then Moses concluded saying,\
"Thou shalt keep therefore\
4:18\
his statutes, and his\
commandments, which I command\
4:22\
thee this day, that it may go\
well with thee, and with thy\
4:26\
children after thee, and\
that thou mayest prolong thy\
4:31\
days upon the earth, which\
the Lord thy God giveth thee,\
4:35\
for ever."\
4:38\
God's prophets have\
consistently instructed\
4:41\
that we need to raise our\
families "in the nurture\
4:45\
and admonition of the Lord"\
and "in light and truth."\
4:48\
President Nelson recently\
said, "In this day\
4:54\
of rampant immorality and\
addictive pornography,\
4:57\
parents have a\
sacred responsibility\
5:00\
to teach their children\
the importance of God\
5:04\
[and Jesus Christ]\
in their lives."\
5:08\
Brothers and sisters, the\
warning of our beloved prophet\
5:12\
is a further reminder of our\
individual responsibility\
5:16\
to seek to learn and to\
teach our families that there\
5:20\
is a Father in\
Heaven who loves us\
5:23\
and who has developed a\
divine plan of happiness\
5:27\
for His children; that\
Jesus Christ, His Son,\
5:30\
is the Redeemer of the\
world; and that salvation\
5:34\
comes from faith in His name.\
5:36\
Our lives need to be rooted upon\
the rock of our Redeemer, Jesus\
5:41\
Christ, which might\
help us individually\
5:44\
and as families to have our own\
spiritual impressions engraved\
5:49\
in our hearts, helping us\
to endure in our faith.\
5:54\
You may recall that two\
disciples of John the Baptist\
5:58\
followed Jesus Christ after\
hearing John witness that Jesus\
6:04\
was the Lamb of\
God, the Messiah.\
6:06\
These good men accepted Jesus's\
invitation to "come and see"\
6:11\
and abode with Him that day.\
6:14\
They came to know that Jesus\
was the Messiah, the Son of God,\
6:19\
and followed Him for\
the rest of their lives.\
6:23\
Likewise, when we accept\
the Savior's invitation\
6:27\
to "come and see," we\
need to abide in Him,\
6:30\
immersing ourselves in the\
scriptures, rejoicing in them,\
6:35\
learning His\
doctrine, and striving\
6:38\
to live the way He lived.\
6:40\
Only then will we come to\
know Him, Jesus Christ,\
6:45\
and recognize His voice,\
knowing that as we come unto Him\
6:50\
and believe in Him, we shall\
never hunger nor thirst.\
6:55\
We will be able to discern\
the truth at all times,\
6:59\
as occurred to those\
two disciples who\
7:02\
abode with Jesus that day.\
7:05\
Brothers and sisters, that\
doesn't happen by chance.\
7:09\
Attuning ourselves to the\
highest influences of godliness\
7:14\
is not a simple matter; it\
requires calling upon God\
7:18\
and learning how to bring\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
7:21\
to the center of our lives.\
7:24\
If we do so, I promise that\
the influence of the Holy Ghost\
7:29\
will bring truth to\
our heart and mind\
7:32\
and will bear witness of\
it, teaching all things.\
7:36\
The Ethiopian's\
question, "How can\
7:39\
I [understand], except\
some man should guide me?"\
7:42\
has also a special\
meaning in the context\
7:46\
of our individual\
responsibility to put\
7:49\
the principles of the\
gospel we have learned\
7:52\
into practice in our lives.\
7:54\
In the Ethiopian's\
case, for example,\
7:57\
he acted upon the truth\
he learned from Philip.\
8:01\
He asked to be baptized.\
8:03\
He came to know that Jesus\
Christ was the Son of God.\
8:08\
Brothers and\
sisters, our actions\
8:11\
must reflect what\
we learn and teach.\
8:14\
We need to show our beliefs\
through the way we live.\
8:18\
The best teacher is\
a good role model.\
8:21\
Teaching something\
that we truly live\
8:24\
can make a difference in the\
hearts of those we teach.\
8:28\
If we desire people, whether\
that be family or not,\
8:32\
to joyfully treasure up the\
scriptures and the teachings\
8:36\
of living apostles and\
prophets of our day,\
8:39\
they need to see our\
souls delighting in them.\
8:43\
Likewise, if we want them to\
know that President Russell M.\
8:48\
Nelson is the prophet, seer,\
and revelator in our day,\
8:53\
they need to see us raise\
our hands to sustain him\
8:57\
and realize that we follow\
his inspired teachings.\
9:01\
As the well-known\
American saying goes,\
9:05\
"Actions speak\
louder than words."\
9:08\
Maybe some of you are at this\
exact moment asking yourselves,\
9:13\
"Elder Soares, I have been\
doing all these things\
9:17\
and have been following\
this model both individually\
9:21\
and as families,\
but unfortunately,\
9:24\
some of my friends or dear\
ones have distanced themselves\
9:29\
from the Lord.\
9:30\
What should I do?"\
9:32\
For those of you who are right\
now experiencing these feelings\
9:36\
of sadness, agony,\
and maybe regret,\
9:41\
please know that they\
are not totally lost,\
9:44\
because the Lord\
knows where they\
9:46\
are and is watching over them.\
9:49\
Remember, they are\
His children too!\
9:52\
It is hard to understand\
all the reasons why\
9:55\
some people take another path.\
9:57\
The best we can do in\
these circumstances\
10:01\
is to just love and\
embrace them, pray\
10:04\
for their well-being, and\
seek for the Lord's help\
10:07\
to know what to do and say.\
10:10\
Sincerely rejoice with\
them in their successes;\
10:15\
be their friends and look\
for the good in them.\
10:19\
We should never give up on them\
but preserve our relationships.\
10:24\
Never reject or misjudge them.\
10:27\
Just love them!\
10:29\
The parable of the\
prodigal son teaches us\
10:32\
that when children\
come to themselves,\
10:35\
they often desire to come home.\
10:37\
If that happens\
with your dear ones,\
10:40\
fill your hearts with\
compassion, run to them,\
10:44\
fall on their\
neck, and kiss them\
10:46\
like the father of\
the prodigal son did.\
10:51\
Ultimately, keep\
living a worthy life,\
10:54\
be a good example to\
them of what you believe,\
10:57\
and draw closer to your\
Savior Jesus Christ.\
11:01\
He knows and understands\
our deep sorrows and pains,\
11:05\
and He will bless your\
efforts and dedication\
11:08\
to your dear ones, if not in\
this life, in the next life.\
11:13\
Remember, brothers and\
sisters, always, that hope\
11:18\
is an important part\
of the gospel plan.\
11:22\
Throughout many years of\
service in the Church,\
11:25\
I have seen faithful members\
who have consistently\
11:29\
applied these principles\
in their lives.\
11:31\
This is the case\
of a single mother\
11:36\
whom I will refer to as "Mary."\
11:39\
Sadly, Mary went through\
a tragic divorce.\
11:43\
At that point in\
time, Mary recognized\
11:49\
that her most critical\
decisions relating to her family\
11:54\
would be spiritual.\
11:56\
Would praying, scripture study,\
fasting, and church and temple\
12:01\
attendance continue to\
be important to her?\
12:04\
Mary had always been faithful,\
and at that critical juncture\
12:09\
she decided to cling to what\
she already knew to be true.\
12:13\
She found strength in "The\
Family: A Proclamation\
12:17\
to the World," which, among\
many wonderful principles,\
12:21\
teaches that parents\
have a sacred duty\
12:24\
to rear their children\
in love and righteousness\
12:27\
and to teach them to always\
observe God's commandments.\
12:32\
She continually searched\
for answers from the Lord\
12:36\
and shared them with\
her four children\
12:39\
in every family setting.\
12:41\
They frequently\
discussed the gospel\
12:44\
and shared their experiences and\
testimonies with one another.\
12:48\
Despite the sorrows\
they went through,\
12:51\
her children developed a\
love for Christ's gospel\
12:54\
and a desire to serve\
and share it with others.\
12:58\
Three of them faithfully\
served full-time missions,\
13:02\
and the youngest is now\
serving in South America.\
13:05\
Her oldest daughter, who\
I know pretty well, who\
13:07\
is now married and\
strong in her faith,\
13:10\
shared, "I never felt like\
my mom raised us alone,\
13:16\
because the Lord was\
always in our home.\
13:19\
As she bore her\
witness of Him to us,\
13:22\
we each began to turn to\
Him with our own questions.\
13:27\
I am so grateful she\
brought the gospel to life."\
13:33\
Brothers and sisters,\
this good mother\
13:35\
was able to make her home a\
center of spiritual learning.\
13:41\
Similar to the\
Ethiopian's question,\
13:44\
Mary asked herself\
several times,\
13:47\
"How can my children\
learn except a mother\
13:51\
should guide them?"\
13:54\
My dear companions\
in the gospel,\
13:56\
I testify to you that when\
we earnestly, heartily,\
14:02\
firmly, and sincerely seek\
to learn the gospel of Jesus\
14:07\
Christ and teach it to one\
another with real purpose\
14:13\
and under the influence\
of the Spirit,\
14:16\
these teachings may transform\
hearts and inspire a desire\
14:20\
to live according to\
the truths of God.\
14:24\
I testify that Jesus Christ\
is the Savior of the world.\
14:28\
He is the Redeemer,\
and He lives.\
14:31\
I know He directs His Church\
through prophets, seers,\
14:35\
and revelators.\
14:36\
I also testify to you that\
God lives, that He loves us,\
14:42\
and He wants us back in\
His presence--all of us.\
14:46\
He listens to our prayers.\
14:48\
I bear my testimony of\
these truths in the name\
14:53\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
