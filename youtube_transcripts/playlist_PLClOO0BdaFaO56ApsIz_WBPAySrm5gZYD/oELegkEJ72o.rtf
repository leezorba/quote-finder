Dear brothers and\
sisters, have you ever\
0:03\
had trouble falling asleep and\
tried counting imaginary sheep?\
0:09\
As fluffy sheep jump over a\
fence, you count: 1, 2, 3, ...\
0:20\
245, 246, ...\
0:21\
657, 658 ...\
0:24\
In my case, counting sheep\
doesn't make me sleepy.\
0:29\
I worry about missing or losing\
one, and that keeps me awake.\
0:34\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:38\
With the shepherd boy who\
became a king, we declare:\
0:42\
"The Lord is my shepherd;\
I shall not want.\
0:46\
"He maketh me to lie\
down in green pastures:\
0:49\
he leadeth me beside\
the still waters.\
0:52\
"He restoreth my soul."\
0:55\
At this Easter season, we\
celebrate the Good Shepherd\
0:59\
who is also the Lamb of God.\
1:01\
Of all His divine\
titles, no others\
1:05\
are more tender or telling.\
1:08\
We learn much from our\
Savior's reference to Himself\
1:11\
as the Good Shepherd and from\
prophetic testimonies of Him\
1:15\
as the Lamb of God.\
1:17\
These roles and symbols are\
powerfully complementary--who\
1:21\
better to succor each precious\
lamb than the Good Shepherd,\
1:25\
and who better to be our Good\
Shepherd than the Lamb of God?\
1:32\
"For God so loved the world,\
that he gave his only begotten\
1:36\
Son," and God's\
Only Begotten Son\
1:40\
laid down His life in willing\
obedience to His Father.\
1:44\
Jesus testifies, "I\
am the good shepherd:\
1:48\
the good shepherd giveth\
his life for the sheep."\
1:52\
Jesus had power to lay\
down His life and power\
1:56\
to take it up again.\
1:58\
United with His Father,\
our Savior uniquely\
2:02\
blesses us, both as\
our Good Shepherd\
2:05\
and as the Lamb of God.\
2:09\
As our Good Shepherd,\
Jesus Christ\
2:11\
calls His sheep in His\
voice and His name.\
2:15\
He seeks and gathers us.\
2:17\
He teaches us how\
to minister in love.\
2:20\
Let us consider these\
three themes, beginning\
2:24\
with Him calling us in\
His voice and His name.\
2:29\
First, our Good Shepherd\
"calleth his own sheep by name.\
2:33\
...\
2:33\
They know his voice."\
2:35\
And "in his own name\
he doth call you,\
2:39\
which is the name of Christ."\
2:41\
As we seek with real intent\
to follow Jesus Christ,\
2:46\
inspiration comes to do good,\
to love God, and to serve Him.\
2:51\
As we study, ponder, and\
pray; as we regularly\
2:55\
renew sacramental\
and temple covenants;\
2:58\
and as we invite all to come\
to His gospel and ordinances,\
3:02\
we are hearkening to His voice.\
3:06\
In our day President Russell\
M. Nelson counsels us to call\
3:10\
the restored Church by the\
name Jesus Christ revealed--The\
3:14\
Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
3:19\
The Lord said,\
"Whatsoever ye shall do,\
3:23\
ye shall do it in my\
name; therefore ye\
3:27\
shall call the\
church in my name;\
3:31\
and ye shall call upon\
the Father in my name\
3:35\
that he will bless the\
church for my sake."\
3:39\
Across the world, in\
our hearts and homes,\
3:43\
we call upon the Father in\
the name of Jesus Christ.\
3:47\
We are grateful for\
such generous blessings\
3:51\
of our home-centered,\
Church-supported worship,\
3:54\
gospel study, and wholesome\
family activities.\
3:58\
Second, our Good Shepherd\
seeks and gathers us\
4:01\
into His one fold.\
4:03\
He asks, "What\
man of you, having\
4:06\
an hundred sheep, if\
he lose one of them,\
4:09\
doth not leave the ninety\
and nine in the wilderness,\
4:12\
and go after that which is\
lost, until he find it?"\
4:18\
Our Savior reaches out to the\
one and to the ninety and nine,\
4:22\
often at the same time.\
4:25\
As we minister, we acknowledge\
the ninety and nine\
4:29\
who are steadfast and\
immovable, even while we yearn\
4:32\
after the one who has strayed.\
4:35\
Our Savior seeks and delivers\
us out of all places,\
4:39\
from the four\
quarters of the earth.\
4:41\
He gathers us by holy covenant\
and His atoning blood.\
4:48\
Our Savior told His New\
Testament disciples,\
4:51\
"Other sheep I have, which\
are not of this fold."\
4:54\
In the Americas,\
the resurrected Lord\
4:57\
testified to Lehi's covenant\
children, "Ye are my sheep."\
5:01\
And Jesus said yet other\
sheep would hear His voice.\
5:06\
What a blessing the Book of\
Mormon is as another testament\
5:10\
witnessing the voice\
of Jesus Christ!\
5:15\
Jesus Christ invites\
the Church to receive\
5:18\
all who hear His voice\
and keep His commandments.\
5:22\
The doctrine of Christ\
includes baptism by water\
5:26\
and by fire and the Holy Ghost.\
5:29\
Nephi asks, "If the Lamb\
of God, he being holy,\
5:33\
should have need to\
be baptized by water,\
5:36\
to fulfil all righteousness,\
O then, how much more need\
5:40\
have we, being unholy, to be\
baptized, yea, even by water!"\
5:48\
Today our Savior\
desires that what we do\
5:51\
and who we are\
becoming will invite\
5:53\
others to come follow Him.\
5:57\
Come find love, healing,\
connection, and covenant\
6:03\
belonging in Him, including\
in God's holy temple, where\
6:08\
sacred ordinances of salvation\
can bless all family members,\
6:14\
thus gathering Israel on\
both sides of the veil.\
6:19\
Third, as the\
"Shepherd of Israel,"\
6:23\
Jesus Christ exemplifies how\
shepherds in Israel minister\
6:27\
in love.\
6:28\
When our Lord asks\
if we love Him,\
6:31\
as He did with Simon\
Peter, our Savior implores:\
6:35\
"Feed my lambs. ...\
6:37\
Feed my sheep.\
6:38\
...\
6:39\
Feed my sheep."\
6:41\
The Lord promises that when\
His shepherds feed His lambs\
6:45\
and sheep, those in His\
fold "shall fear no more,\
6:50\
nor be dismayed, neither\
shall they be lacking."\
6:56\
Our Good Shepherd cautions\
that shepherds in Israel\
6:58\
must not slumber, nor scatter\
or cause the sheep to go astray,\
7:04\
nor look our own way\
for our own gain.\
7:08\
God's shepherds are to\
strengthen, heal, bind up\
7:13\
that which is\
broken, bring again\
7:16\
that which was driven away,\
seek that which was lost.\
7:22\
The Lord also warns of hirelings\
who "careth not for the sheep,"\
7:27\
and "false prophets, who come\
to you in sheep's clothing,\
7:31\
but inwardly they\
are ravening wolves."\
7:35\
Our Good Shepherd\
rejoices when we\
7:37\
exercise individual moral\
agency with intention and faith.\
7:42\
Those in His fold\
look to our Savior\
7:45\
in gratitude for His\
atoning sacrifice.\
7:48\
We covenant to follow\
Him, not passively,\
7:52\
blindly, or\
"sheepishly," but instead\
7:56\
desiring with all\
our hearts and minds\
7:58\
to love God and our neighbor,\
bearing one another's burdens\
8:03\
and rejoicing in\
one another's joys.\
8:06\
As Christ freely dedicated His\
will to the will of the Father,\
8:10\
so we reverently take\
upon us His name.\
8:13\
We gladly seek to join His work\
of gathering and ministering\
8:19\
to all of God's children.\
8:23\
Brothers and\
sisters, Jesus Christ\
8:26\
is our perfect good Shepherd.\
8:28\
Because He has laid\
down His life for us\
8:32\
and is now gloriously\
resurrected,\
8:36\
Jesus Christ is also\
the perfect Lamb of God.\
8:42\
The sacrificial Lamb of God, as\
we have heard and been taught,\
8:45\
was foreshadowed\
from the beginning.\
8:48\
The angel told Adam\
his sacrifice "is\
8:51\
a similitude of the sacrifice\
of the Only Begotten\
8:55\
of the Father," which invites\
us to "repent and call\
8:59\
upon God in the name of\
the Son forevermore."\
9:04\
Father Abraham, who\
established covenant blessings\
9:08\
for all the nations of\
the earth, experienced\
9:11\
what it meant to offer\
his begotten son:\
9:17\
"And Isaac spake unto\
Abraham his father,\
9:19\
and said, My father: and he\
said, Here [I am], my son.\
9:26\
And he said, Behold\
the fire and the wood:\
9:28\
but where is the lamb ...\
9:31\
?"\
9:32\
"And Abraham said, My son, God\
will provide himself a lamb."\
9:40\
Apostles and prophets\
foresaw and rejoiced\
9:43\
in the foreordained\
mission of the Lamb of God.\
9:46\
John in the Old World and Nephi\
in the New World testified\
9:50\
of "the Lamb of God," "yea,\
even the Son of the Eternal\
9:53\
FatherFather[,] ... the\
Redeemer of the world."\
9:57\
Abinadi testified of Jesus\
Christ's atoning sacrifice:\
10:01\
"All we, like sheep,\
have gone astray;\
10:04\
we have turned every\
one to his own way;\
10:08\
and the Lord hath laid on him\
the [iniquity] of us all."\
10:15\
Alma called the great and last\
sacrifice of the Son of God\
10:18\
the "one thing which is of\
more importance than they all."\
10:22\
Alma encourages, "Have\
faith on the Lamb of God";\
10:27\
"come and fear not."\
10:31\
A dear friend,\
here today, shared\
10:33\
how she gained her precious\
testimony of the Atonement\
10:36\
of Jesus Christ.\
10:38\
She grew up believing sin always\
brought great punishment, borne\
10:42\
by us alone.\
10:44\
She pleaded to God to\
understand the possibility\
10:47\
of divine forgiveness.\
10:48\
She prayed to\
understand and to know\
10:52\
how Jesus Christ can\
forgive those who repent,\
10:55\
how mercy can satisfy justice.\
10:59\
One day her prayer was answered\
in a spiritually transforming\
11:03\
experience.\
11:04\
A desperate young\
man came running out\
11:06\
of a grocery store carrying\
two bags of stolen food.\
11:10\
He ran into a busy\
street, chased\
11:12\
by the store manager,\
who caught him\
11:14\
and began yelling and fighting.\
11:17\
Instead of judgment for\
the frightened young man\
11:20\
as a thief, my friend\
was unexpectedly\
11:24\
filled with great\
compassion for him.\
11:27\
Without fear or concern\
for her own safety,\
11:30\
she walked straight up to\
the two quarreling men.\
11:33\
She found herself saying,\
"I will pay for the food.\
11:37\
Please let him go.\
11:38\
Please let me pay for the food."\
11:42\
Prompted by the Holy\
Ghost and filled\
11:44\
with a love she had never\
felt before, my friend said,\
11:49\
"All I wanted to do was help\
and save the young man."\
11:52\
My friend said she began to\
understand Jesus Christ and His\
11:57\
Atonement--how and why with pure\
and perfect love Jesus Christ\
12:03\
would willingly sacrifice to\
be her Savior and Redeemer,\
12:07\
and why she wanted Him to be.\
12:11\
No wonder we sing:\
12:13\
"See, the Good\
Shepherd is seeking,\
12:16\
Seeking the lambs that are lost,\
12:19\
Bringing them in with rejoicing,\
12:21\
Saved at such infinite cost."\
12:25\
As Lamb of God, our Savior knows\
when we feel alone, diminished,\
12:29\
uncertain, or afraid.\
12:31\
In vision Nephi saw\
the power of the Lamb\
12:35\
of God descend "upon the saints\
of the church of the Lamb,\
12:39\
and upon the covenant\
people of the Lord."\
12:42\
Though "scattered upon all\
the face of the earth; ...\
12:45\
they were armed with\
righteousness and with\
12:48\
the power of God\
in great glory."\
12:51\
This promise of hope and\
comfort includes our day.\
12:56\
Are you the only member of the\
Church in your family, school,\
13:00\
workplace, or community?\
13:02\
Does your branch sometimes\
feel small or isolated?\
13:06\
Have you moved to a\
new place, perhaps\
13:08\
with an unfamiliar\
language or customs?\
13:10\
Perhaps your life's\
circumstances have changed,\
13:13\
and things you never thought\
possible now confront you?\
13:19\
Our Savior assures us,\
whatever our circumstances,\
13:24\
whoever we are, in\
the words of Isaiah:\
13:27\
"He shall gather the\
lambs with his arm,\
13:30\
and carry them in his\
bosom, and shall gently lead\
13:33\
those that are with young."\
13:36\
Brothers and sisters, our Good\
Shepherd calls us in His voice\
13:41\
and in His name.\
13:42\
He seeks, gathers, and\
comes to His people.\
13:46\
Through His living\
prophet and each of us,\
13:49\
He invites all to find\
peace, purpose, healing,\
13:53\
and joy in the fulness\
of His restored gospel\
13:56\
and on His covenant path.\
13:59\
By example He teaches\
the shepherds of Israel\
14:03\
to minister in His love.\
14:05\
As Lamb of God,\
His divine mission\
14:07\
was foreordained and rejoiced\
in by apostles and prophets.\
14:11\
His Atonement,\
infinite and eternal,\
14:14\
is central to the\
plan of happiness\
14:16\
and the purpose of creation.\
14:18\
He assures us that He\
carries us next to His heart.\
14:24\
Dear brothers and\
sisters, may we\
14:26\
desire to be "humble followers\
of God and the Lamb,"\
14:30\
perhaps someday to have our\
names written in the Lamb's\
14:34\
book of life, to sing\
the song of the Lamb,\
14:37\
to be invited to the\
supper of the Lamb.\
14:41\
As Shepherd and Lamb, He\
calls: Come again "to the true\
14:44\
knowledge ... of\
[your] Redeemer, ...\
14:47\
[your] great and true shepherd."\
14:49\
I testify of him,\
our perfect Shepherd,\
14:54\
our perfect Lamb of God.\
14:57\
He calls us by His name, even\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
