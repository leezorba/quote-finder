I was doing just\
fine until I saw\
0:05\
those tears in the eyes of those\
young people in this choir.\
0:12\
And those tears are a\
more eloquent sermon\
0:15\
than I could ever give.\
0:21\
Looking up from water's edge,\
past the eager crowds seeking\
0:28\
baptism at his hand,\
John, called the Baptist,\
0:33\
saw in the distance his\
cousin, Jesus of Nazareth,\
0:39\
striding resolutely toward\
him to make a request\
0:44\
for that ordinance at his hand.\
0:48\
Reverently, but audible enough\
for those nearby to hear,\
0:53\
John uttered the admiration\
that still moves us\
0:58\
two millennia later:\
"Behold the Lamb of God."\
1:08\
It's instructive that this\
long-prophesied forerunner\
1:11\
to Jesus did not call\
Him "Jehovah" or "Savior"\
1:17\
or even "the Son of God"--all\
of which were applicable titles.\
1:23\
No, John chose the earliest\
and perhaps most commonly\
1:29\
recognized image in\
the religious tradition\
1:32\
of his people.\
1:34\
He used the figure of a\
sacrificial lamb offered\
1:40\
in atonement for the sins\
and sorrows of a fallen world\
1:46\
and all the fallen people in it.\
1:49\
Please indulge me in recalling\
just a little of that history.\
1:54\
After expulsion from\
the Garden of Eden,\
1:58\
Adam and Eve faced a\
devastating future.\
2:01\
Having opened the door to\
mortality and temporal life\
2:06\
for us, they had closed the\
door to immortality and eternal\
2:12\
lives for themselves.\
2:14\
Due to a trasngression\
they had consciously\
2:17\
chosen to make in\
our behalf, they now\
2:21\
faced physical death and\
spiritual banishment,\
2:25\
separation from the\
presence of God forever.\
2:31\
What were they to do?\
2:33\
Would there be a way\
out of this plight?\
2:36\
We're not certain just how\
much these two were allowed\
2:41\
to remember of the instruction\
they received while still\
2:45\
in the garden, but\
they did remember\
2:49\
they were to regularly offer\
for a sacrifice unto God\
2:53\
a pure, unblemished lamb, the\
first male born of their flock.\
3:01\
Later an angel came to explain\
that this sacrifice was\
3:05\
a type--it was a prefiguration\
of the offering that would be\
3:10\
made in their behalf by the\
Savior of the world who was\
3:14\
to come.\
3:16\
"This thing is a\
similitude of the sacrifice\
3:20\
of the Only Begotten of the\
Father," the angel said.\
3:24\
"Wherefore, ... thou shalt\
repent and call upon God\
3:29\
in the name of the\
Son forevermore."\
3:33\
Fortunately, there was going\
to be a way out and a way up.\
3:41\
In the premortal\
councils of heaven,\
3:43\
God had promised Adam and\
Eve (and all the rest of us)\
3:48\
that help would\
come from His pure,\
3:51\
unblemished Firstborn\
Son, the Lamb\
3:55\
of God "slain from the\
foundation of the world,"\
3:59\
as the Apostle John\
would later describe Him.\
4:03\
By offering their own little\
symbolic lambs in mortality,\
4:08\
Adam and his posterity were\
expressing their understanding\
4:13\
of and dependence upon the\
atoning sacrifice of Jesus\
4:19\
the Anointed One.\
4:21\
Later, the wilderness tabernacle\
would become the setting\
4:25\
for this ordinance and,\
after that, the temple\
4:29\
that Solomon would build.\
4:32\
Unfortunately, as a symbol of\
genuine repentance and faithful\
4:37\
living, this ritualistic\
offering of unblemished lambs\
4:42\
didn't work very\
well, as so much\
4:45\
of the Old Testament reveals.\
4:48\
The moral resolve that\
should have accompanied\
4:51\
those sacrifices sometimes\
didn't last long enough\
4:55\
for the blood to\
dry upon the stones.\
4:58\
In any case, it didn't last long\
enough to preclude fratricide,\
5:03\
with Cain killing his brother\
Abel in the first generation.\
5:10\
With such trials and troubles\
going on for centuries,\
5:13\
no wonder the angels of heaven\
sang for joy when, finally,\
5:19\
Jesus was born--the\
long-promised Messiah Himself.\
5:26\
Then following His\
brief mortal ministry,\
5:30\
this purest of\
all Passover sheep\
5:33\
prepared His disciples\
for His death\
5:37\
by introducing the sacrament\
of the Lord's Supper, a more\
5:42\
personal form of the ordinance\
that had been introduced\
5:46\
outside of Eden.\
5:48\
There would still\
be an offering,\
5:51\
it would still\
involve a sacrifice,\
5:54\
but it would be with symbolism\
much deeper, much more\
5:59\
introspective and personal than\
the bloodletting of a firstborn\
6:04\
lamb.\
6:05\
To the Nephites, after\
His Resurrection,\
6:08\
the Savior said of this:\
6:11\
"Ye shall offer up unto me no\
more the shedding of blood. ...\
6:15\
"...\
6:15\
Ye shall offer for\
a sacrifice unto\
6:17\
me a broken heart and\
a contrite spirit.\
6:22\
And whoso cometh unto\
me with a broken heart\
6:26\
and a contrite\
spirit, him will I\
6:29\
baptize with fire and\
with the Holy Ghost.\
6:33\
...\
6:33\
"...\
6:34\
Therefore repent,\
... and be saved."\
6:40\
My beloved brothers and sisters,\
with the exciting new emphasis\
6:45\
on increased gospel learning in\
the home, it is crucial for us\
6:49\
to remember that we\
are still commanded\
6:53\
to "go to the house of\
prayer and offer up thy\
6:57\
sacraments upon my holy day."\
7:00\
In addition to making time\
for more home-centered gospel\
7:06\
instruction, our\
modified Sunday service\
7:10\
is also to reduce the complexity\
of the meeting schedule\
7:16\
in a way that\
properly emphasizes\
7:20\
the sacrament of\
the Lord's Supper\
7:23\
as the sacred,\
acknowledged focal point\
7:28\
of our weekly\
worship experience.\
7:31\
We are to remember in as\
personal a way as possible\
7:36\
that Christ died from a heart\
broken by shouldering entirely\
7:44\
alone the sins and sorrows\
of the human family.\
7:52\
Inasmuch as we contributed\
to that fatal burden,\
7:56\
such a moment\
demands our respect.\
8:04\
Thus, we are encouraged to\
come to our services early\
8:08\
and reverently, dressed\
appropriately for participation\
8:13\
in a sacred ordinance--the\
sacred ordinance.\
8:16\
"Sunday best" has lost a little\
of its meaning in our time,\
8:22\
and out of esteem for Him\
into whose presence we come,\
8:26\
we ought to restore that\
tradition of dress and grooming\
8:30\
when and where we can.\
8:33\
As for punctuality, a\
late pass will always\
8:37\
be lovingly granted to\
those blessed mothers who,\
8:41\
with children and Cheerios\
and diaper bags trailing\
8:45\
in marvelous disarray,\
are lucky to have made it\
8:49\
to church at all.\
8:52\
Furthermore, there\
will be others\
8:55\
who unavoidably find their ox\
in the mire on a Sunday morning.\
8:59\
However, to this\
latter group we say\
9:03\
an occasional tardiness\
is understandable,\
9:07\
but if the ox is in\
the mire every Sunday,\
9:11\
then we strongly recommend\
that you sell the ox\
9:14\
or fill the mire.\
9:21\
In that same spirit, we\
make an apostolic plea\
9:25\
for the reduction of clamor in\
the sanctuary of our buildings.\
9:30\
We love to visit with\
each other--we are great\
9:34\
visitors--and we should be--it\
is one of the joys of church\
9:38\
attendance--but it ought not\
be pursued so vocally in space\
9:44\
specifically\
dedicated for worship.\
9:47\
I fear visitors not\
of our faith are\
9:51\
shocked by what can\
sometimes be noisy\
9:56\
irreverence in a\
setting that is supposed\
9:59\
to be characterized by prayer,\
revelation, hymns, and peace.\
10:05\
Perhaps heaven is a\
little shocked as well.\
10:11\
It will add to the spirit\
of our sacrament meetings\
10:14\
if the presiding\
officers are on the stand\
10:17\
well before it is to begin,\
listening to the prelude music\
10:21\
and reverently setting\
the example the rest of us\
10:25\
ought to follow.\
10:26\
If there is chatter\
on the stand,\
10:29\
we should not be\
surprised at any chatter\
10:32\
in the congregation.\
10:34\
We congratulate\
those bishoprics who\
10:37\
are eliminating\
announcements that detract\
10:40\
from the spirit of our worship.\
10:42\
I, for one, cannot imagine a\
priest such as Zacharias--there\
10:50\
in the ancient\
temple of the Lord,\
10:53\
about to participate in the\
one and only priestly privilege\
10:59\
that would come to him in his\
entire lifetime--I just cannot\
11:05\
picture him pausing before\
the altar to remind us that\
11:09\
the pinewood derby is just six\
weeks away and registration\
11:14\
will soon be due.\
11:17\
Brothers and sisters, this\
hour ordained of the Lord\
11:22\
is the most sacred\
hour of our week.\
11:25\
By commandment, we gather for\
the most universally received\
11:30\
ordinance in the Church.\
11:32\
It is in memory of Him\
who asked if the cup He\
11:38\
was about to drink\
could pass, only\
11:42\
to soldier on because He\
knew that for our sake\
11:47\
it could not pass.\
11:50\
It will help us if we remember\
that a symbol of that cup\
11:56\
is slowly making its way\
down the row toward us\
12:05\
at the hand of an\
11- or 12-year-old.\
12:17\
When the sacred hour comes to\
present our sacrificial gift\
12:22\
to the Lord, we do have our\
own sins and shortcomings\
12:27\
to resolve.\
12:28\
That's why we're there.\
12:30\
But we might be more\
successful in such contrition\
12:35\
if we are mindful of the other\
broken hearts and sorrowing\
12:38\
spirits that surround us.\
12:41\
Seated not far away in any\
direction are some who may have\
12:47\
wept--outwardly or\
inwardly--through the entire\
12:51\
sacramental hymn and the\
prayers of those priests.\
12:56\
Might we silently take note of\
that and offer our little crust\
13:02\
of comfort and our tiny cup of\
compassion--might we dedicate\
13:10\
it to them--or for the weeping,\
struggling member who is not\
13:15\
in the service and, except for\
some redemptive ministering\
13:20\
on our part, won't be\
there next week either?\
13:23\
Or for our brothers\
and sisters who\
13:28\
are not members of\
the Church at all,\
13:31\
but are our brothers\
and sisters?\
13:36\
There is no shortage of\
suffering in this world,\
13:40\
inside the Church and out,\
so look in any direction\
13:45\
and you will find someone\
whose pain is seeming\
13:49\
too heavy to bear and\
whose heartache seems never\
13:54\
apparently to end.\
13:57\
One way to "always\
remember him" would\
14:01\
be to join the Great Physician\
in His never-ending task\
14:07\
of lifting the load from\
those who are burdened\
14:11\
and relieving the pain of\
those who are distraught.\
14:17\
Beloved friends, as we unite\
across the globe each week\
14:23\
in what is an increasingly\
sacred acknowledgment\
14:28\
of Christ's majestic atoning\
gift to all humankind,\
14:34\
may we bring to the\
sacramental altar\
14:40\
"more tears for his sorrow\
[and] more pain at his grief."\
14:49\
Then, as we reflect,\
pray, and covenant anew,\
14:55\
may we take from that\
sacred moment "more patience\
15:01\
in suff'ring, ...\
15:03\
more praise for relief."\
15:07\
For such patience and relief,\
for such holiness and hope,\
15:15\
I pray for all of you\
in the name of Him\
15:21\
who broke the precious\
bread of forgiveness\
15:27\
and poured the holy\
wine of redemption,\
15:32\
even Jesus Christ, the great and\
merciful and holy Lamb of God,\
15:42\
amen.\
