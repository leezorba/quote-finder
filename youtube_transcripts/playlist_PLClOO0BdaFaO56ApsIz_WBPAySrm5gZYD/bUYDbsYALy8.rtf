Our Heavenly Father loves us.\
0:04\
He has provided a perfect plan\
for us to enjoy His blessings.\
0:08\
In this life, we are all\
invited to come unto Christ\
0:12\
and receive the restored\
gospel of Jesus Christ\
0:15\
through baptism, receiving\
the gift of the Holy Ghost\
0:18\
and faithfully\
living the gospel.\
0:21\
Nephi describes our commitment\
to be baptized as entering\
0:26\
a "strait and narrow path,"\
and he reminds us to continue\
0:30\
to "press forward with a\
steadfastness in Christ, ...\
0:32\
feasting upon the [words] of\
Christ, and endure to the end,"\
0:36\
in order to receive all the\
blessings Heavenly Father has\
0:39\
in store for us.\
0:41\
Nephi further\
reminds us that if we\
0:43\
will "feast upon the\
words of Christ,"\
0:45\
they "will tell [us] all\
things [we] should do"\
0:48\
and that we will be empowered\
to overcome the "fiery darts\
0:51\
of the adversary."\
0:54\
When I was young, I thought\
that the feasting was simply\
0:57\
having a big meal with\
rice, sushi, and soy sauce.\
1:04\
[LAUGHTER]\
1:04\
I now know true feasting is more\
than enjoying a delicious meal.\
1:08\
It is an experience of joy,\
nourishment, celebration,\
1:13\
sharing, expressing love\
to families and loved ones,\
1:17\
communicating our\
thanksgiving to God,\
1:20\
and building relationships while\
enjoying abundant, incredibly\
1:24\
delicious food.\
1:25\
I believe when we feast\
upon the words of Christ,\
1:29\
we ought to be thinking of\
the same kind of experience.\
1:33\
Feasting upon the scriptures\
is not just reading them.\
1:37\
It should bring us real joy\
and build our relationship\
1:40\
with the Savior.\
1:43\
This is clearly taught\
in the Book of Mormon.\
1:45\
Recall Lehi's dream where he\
saw a tree "whose fruit [is]\
1:50\
desirable to make one happy."\
1:52\
This fruit represents\
the love of God,\
1:55\
and as Lehi tastes the\
fruit, "it was ... sweet,\
1:58\
above all that [he]\
ever before tasted."\
2:01\
It "filled [his] soul with\
exceedingly great joy"\
2:04\
and is something he wants\
to share with his family.\
2:10\
When we feast, we\
will also likely find\
2:12\
that the amount or\
kind of food we have\
2:14\
may not matter if our hearts\
are filled with gratitude.\
2:18\
Lehi's family lived on raw\
meat in the wilderness,\
2:22\
but Nephi described this\
difficult trial saying,\
2:25\
"So great were the blessings of\
the Lord" that "our women ...\
2:29\
were strong" and were able\
to bear children "without\
2:32\
murmuring."\
2:34\
Feasting sometimes involves\
experimenting and tasting.\
2:37\
Alma talks about a good seed\
being planted in our hearts,\
2:41\
and as we experiment\
on it, we will\
2:43\
realize the seed begins\
"to be delicious."\
2:48\
The blessings of feasting\
upon the words of Christ\
2:51\
are powerful and life changing.\
2:53\
There are three in\
particular I would\
2:55\
like to invite you to\
apply in your life.\
2:58\
First, the words\
of Christ can help\
3:01\
us "increase [our] spiritual\
capacity to receive revelation"\
3:04\
and safely guide us\
through our life.\
3:07\
Mormon teaches that\
the words of Christ\
3:10\
have "a great tendency to lead\
the people to do that which\
3:14\
[is] just" and that they are\
more powerful than anything\
3:18\
"the sword" can accomplish.\
3:21\
As I have searched\
for God's wisdom\
3:23\
in dealing with\
my own challenges,\
3:25\
always as I have tried the\
"virtue of the word of God,"\
3:29\
I have felt inspired and\
enabled to make wise decisions,\
3:33\
overcome temptations, and\
bless my life with increased\
3:37\
faith in Christ and love\
for those around me.\
3:40\
Our prophet, Russell M.\
Nelson, has taught us\
3:44\
that "in coming\
days, it will not\
3:46\
be possible to\
survive spiritually\
3:48\
without the guiding,\
directing, comforting,\
3:51\
and constant influence\
of the Holy Ghost."\
3:54\
Needed revelation\
will come as we\
3:56\
try the "virtue of the\
word," and that word\
3:59\
will be more powerful\
than anything\
4:01\
else we could try or imagine.\
4:04\
Second, when we struggle with\
our own identity and lack\
4:08\
of self-esteem, the "pleasing\
word of God" in the scriptures\
4:12\
will help us know\
who we really are\
4:14\
and give us strength\
beyond our own.\
4:17\
Recognizing my\
identity as God's child\
4:22\
was one of the sweetest moments\
I have ever experienced.\
4:25\
In my early teenage\
years, I did not\
4:28\
know anything about the\
teachings of the Savior.\
4:31\
When I first read the New\
Testament, the words of Christ\
4:34\
truly healed my wounded soul.\
4:36\
I realized that I was not alone\
and that I am a child of God.\
4:41\
As I recognized my true\
identity before God,\
4:44\
I realized my infinite potential\
through Christ's Atonement.\
4:51\
Enos likewise shared\
his personal experience\
4:53\
of the enlightenment that\
comes from contemplating\
4:56\
the words of Christ.\
4:57\
As Enos let the words that his\
father taught him regarding\
5:01\
"eternal life, and\
the joy of the Saints,\
5:03\
[sink] deep into [his]\
heart," his soul "hungered;\
5:07\
and [he] kneeled down\
before [his] Maker ...\
5:09\
in mighty prayer."\
5:10\
In that prayer he came\
to know the Savior\
5:13\
and learned that\
we have great worth\
5:16\
and are loved and can be\
forgiven of our mistakes\
5:19\
and are truly children of God.\
5:22\
Third, we can lift\
the lives of others\
5:25\
through the words of Christ.\
5:26\
Just as Enos had his\
own time and place where\
5:30\
the words of Christ\
touched his heart,\
5:32\
the Lord will do\
His part to touch\
5:34\
the hearts of those with whom\
we wish to share the gospel.\
5:38\
Many of us may have\
felt discouraged\
5:41\
when we tried to invite\
someone to hear the gospel,\
5:43\
because our desired\
result did not follow.\
5:46\
Regardless of the\
outcome, the Lord\
5:49\
invites us to open our mouth\
and share the gospel message\
5:53\
with them.\
5:55\
Two years ago, the Lord\
touched my dear mother's heart,\
5:58\
which helped her\
decide to receive\
6:01\
the ordinance of baptism.\
6:03\
I had waited for that day\
to come for almost 35 years.\
6:08\
In order for her to\
make that decision,\
6:11\
many members of the Church\
truly ministered to her\
6:14\
as Christ would.\
6:16\
One Sunday, she felt\
she should go to church.\
6:19\
She followed the prompting.\
6:21\
While she sat on the\
front row and waited\
6:24\
for the sacrament\
service to begin,\
6:26\
a four-year-old boy stood in\
front of her and looked at her.\
6:30\
She greeted him with a smile.\
6:33\
The little boy left her presence\
abruptly and walked back\
6:37\
to his own seat, which was\
on the other side of the row\
6:39\
where my mother was seated.\
6:41\
This little boy picked up\
something from his seat\
6:44\
and came back and handed\
my mother a hymnbook\
6:48\
and walked back to his seat.\
6:50\
My mother noticed a hymnbook\
was placed on every other chair\
6:53\
in the chapel.\
6:55\
She could have easily picked one\
up from the chair next to her.\
6:58\
However, she was very impressed\
with the boy's innocent act\
7:02\
of kindness, which he learned\
in his home and at church.\
7:06\
It was a tender moment for her.\
7:08\
She had a strong impression\
that God was inviting her\
7:12\
to come and follow the Savior.\
7:15\
She felt she should be baptized.\
7:19\
This little boy did not seek\
recognition for what he did,\
7:22\
but he simply did his best\
to live the word of God\
7:25\
and to love his neighbor.\
7:27\
His kindness created an\
important change of heart\
7:30\
in my mother.\
7:32\
The words of Christ\
will profoundly\
7:34\
touch hearts and open\
the hearts of those\
7:36\
who do not yet see Him.\
7:37\
On the road to Emmaus, two\
disciples walked with Jesus.\
7:42\
They were sad and did not\
comprehend that the Savior had\
7:45\
triumphed over death.\
7:47\
In their grief, they did not\
recognize that the living\
7:51\
Christ was walking with them.\
7:53\
Though Jesus "expounded unto\
them in all the scriptures\
7:56\
the things concerning\
himself," they still\
7:59\
did not recognize Him as\
the resurrected Savior\
8:02\
until they sat and\
broke bread with Him.\
8:05\
Then did their "eyes" open.\
8:07\
As we--or our\
friends, associates,\
8:11\
and neighbors--feast and\
break bread with Him,\
8:13\
our eyes of\
understanding will open.\
8:16\
When the disciples at Emmaus\
reflected on their time\
8:20\
with the resurrected\
Savior, they\
8:22\
said that their hearts\
burned within them while He\
8:25\
opened the scriptures to them.\
8:26\
This will be true for all of us.\
8:30\
In conclusion, I bear\
testimony that feasting\
8:33\
upon the words of Christ\
can happen at any time\
8:36\
and on any occasion\
if we prepare\
8:39\
our hearts to receive them.\
8:40\
Feasting upon the\
words of Christ\
8:42\
will bring life-sustaining\
revelation,\
8:44\
reaffirm our true identity and\
worth before God as His child,\
8:49\
and lead our friends unto\
Christ and everlasting life.\
8:53\
Let me end by echoing the\
invitation of Nephi when\
8:57\
he said, "Ye must press forward\
with a steadfastness in Christ,\
9:02\
having a perfect brightness\
of hope, and a love of God\
9:06\
and of all men.\
9:07\
Wherefore, if ye shall\
press forward, feasting\
9:11\
upon the word of Christ,\
and endure to the end,\
9:13\
behold, thus saith the Father:\
Ye shall have eternal life."\
9:18\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
