The restored gospel\
of Jesus Christ\
0:04\
encourages us to think\
about the future.\
0:08\
It explains the\
purpose of mortal life\
0:11\
and the reality of\
the life to follow.\
0:15\
It teaches great\
ideas about the future\
0:19\
to guide our actions today.\
0:24\
In contrast, we all know\
persons who are only concerned\
0:28\
with the present: spend it\
today, enjoy it today, and take\
0:33\
no thought for the future.\
0:37\
Our present and our future will\
be happier if we are always\
0:42\
conscious of the future.\
0:44\
As we make current\
decisions, we should always\
0:48\
be asking, "Where\
will this lead?"\
0:53\
Some decisions are choices\
between doing something\
0:57\
or doing nothing.\
0:58\
I heard an example of\
this kind of choice\
1:01\
at a stake conference in the\
United States many years ago.\
1:07\
The setting was a\
beautiful college campus.\
1:10\
A crowd of young students\
were seated on the grass.\
1:14\
The speaker who described\
this circumstance\
1:17\
said they were watching\
a handsome tree squirrel\
1:21\
with a large, bushy tail\
playing around the base\
1:26\
of a beautiful hardwood tree.\
1:28\
Sometimes it was on the\
ground, sometimes up and down\
1:32\
and around the trunk.\
1:34\
But why would that\
familiar sight\
1:36\
attract a crowd of students?\
1:40\
Stretched out prone on the grass\
nearby was an Irish setter.\
1:45\
He was the object of\
the students' interest,\
1:49\
and the squirrel was\
the object of his.\
1:53\
Each time the squirrel was\
momentarily out of sight\
1:57\
circling the tree, the\
setter would quietly\
2:00\
creep forward a few\
inches and then resume\
2:05\
his apparently\
indifferent posture.\
2:09\
This was what held the\
students' interest.\
2:12\
Silent and immobile,\
their eyes were\
2:16\
riveted on the\
event whose outcome\
2:20\
was increasingly obvious.\
2:24\
Finally, the setter was close\
enough to bound at the squirrel\
2:28\
and catch it in his mouth.\
2:30\
A gasp of horror arose,\
and the crowd of students\
2:35\
surged forward and wrested\
the little animal away\
2:38\
from the dog, but\
it was too late.\
2:42\
The squirrel was dead.\
2:49\
Anyone in that crowd could have\
warned the squirrel at any time\
2:54\
by waving arms or crying\
out, but none did.\
2:59\
They just watched while\
the inevitable outcome\
3:03\
got closer and closer.\
3:06\
No one asked, "Where\
will this lead?"\
3:10\
When the predictable\
occurred, all\
3:14\
rushed to prevent the\
outcome, but it was too late.\
3:17\
Tearful regret was\
all they could offer.\
3:23\
That true story is\
a parable of sorts.\
3:26\
It applies to things\
we see in our own lives\
3:29\
and in lives and\
circumstances around us.\
3:33\
As we see threats creeping\
up on persons or things\
3:37\
we love, we have the choice of\
speaking or acting or remaining\
3:44\
silent.\
3:45\
It is well to ask ourselves,\
"Where will this lead?"\
3:50\
Where the consequences\
are immediate and serious,\
3:54\
we cannot afford to do nothing.\
3:57\
We must sound\
appropriate warnings\
4:00\
or support appropriate\
preventive efforts\
4:04\
while there is still time.\
4:08\
The decisions I\
have just described\
4:10\
involve choices between\
taking some action\
4:14\
or taking no action at all.\
4:17\
More common are those choices\
between one action or another.\
4:23\
These include choices\
between good or evil,\
4:27\
but more frequently they are\
choices between two goods.\
4:32\
Here, too, it is desirable\
to ask where this will lead.\
4:37\
We make many choices\
between two goods,\
4:42\
often involving how we\
will spend our time.\
4:46\
There is nothing bad\
about playing video games\
4:50\
or texting or watching TV\
or talking on a cell phone.\
4:55\
But each of these involves what\
is called "opportunity cost,"\
5:00\
meaning that if we spend\
time doing one thing,\
5:04\
we lose the opportunity\
to do another.\
5:08\
I am sure you can see that we\
need to measure thoughtfully\
5:13\
what we are losing by\
spending the time we\
5:16\
spend on one activity, even if\
it is perfectly good in itself.\
5:24\
Some time ago I gave a talk\
titled "Good, Better, or Best."\
5:28\
In that talk I said that "just\
because something is good\
5:34\
is not a sufficient\
reason for doing it.\
5:37\
The number of good\
things we can do far\
5:40\
exceeds the time available\
to accomplish them.\
5:44\
Some things are\
better than good,\
5:46\
and these are the things\
that should command priority\
5:50\
attention in our lives. ...\
5:52\
We have to forego some\
good things in order\
5:57\
to choose others that\
are better or best."\
6:01\
That's what I said\
in the earlier talk.\
6:05\
Take the long view.\
6:06\
What is the effect on our\
future of the decisions\
6:10\
we make in the present?\
6:12\
Remember the importance\
of getting an education,\
6:16\
studying the gospel,\
renewing our covenants\
6:20\
by partaking of the sacrament,\
and attending the temple.\
6:27\
"Where will this lead?" is\
also important in choosing how\
6:30\
we label or think of ourselves.\
6:35\
Most importantly,\
each of us is a child\
6:38\
of God with a potential\
destiny of eternal life.\
6:42\
Every other label, even\
including occupation, race,\
6:50\
physical characteristics,\
or honors,\
6:54\
is temporary or trivial\
in eternal terms.\
7:00\
Don't choose to label yourselves\
or think of yourselves\
7:04\
in terms that put a limit\
on a goal for which you\
7:07\
might strive.\
7:11\
My brethren, and my sisters\
who may view or read\
7:15\
what I say here, I\
hope you know why\
7:18\
your leaders give the\
teachings and counsel we give.\
7:21\
We love you, and our\
Heavenly Father and His Son,\
7:25\
Jesus Christ, love you.\
7:27\
Their plan for us is the\
"great plan of happiness."\
7:32\
That plan and Their commandments\
and ordinances and covenants\
7:36\
lead us to the greatest\
happiness and joy in this life\
7:41\
and in the life to come.\
7:43\
As servants of the\
Father and the Son,\
7:47\
we teach and counsel as\
They have directed us\
7:51\
by the Holy Ghost.\
7:52\
We have no desire other\
than to speak what is true\
7:57\
and to encourage you to\
do what They have outlined\
8:01\
as the pathway to eternal\
life, "the greatest\
8:05\
of all the gifts of God."\
8:10\
Here is another\
example of the effect\
8:12\
on the future of decisions\
made in the present.\
8:16\
This example concerns the choice\
to make a present sacrifice\
8:22\
to achieve an\
important future goal.\
8:26\
At a stake conference\
in Cali, Colombia,\
8:29\
a sister told how\
she and her fiance\
8:32\
desired to be married in\
the temple, but at that time\
8:38\
the closest temple\
was in faraway Peru.\
8:42\
For a long time they saved\
their money for the bus fares.\
8:46\
Finally they boarded\
the bus to Bogota,\
8:50\
but when they\
arrived there, they\
8:52\
learned that all seats on the\
bus to Lima, Peru, were taken.\
8:58\
They could go home\
without being married,\
9:01\
or be married out of the temple.\
9:04\
Fortunately, there was\
one other alternative.\
9:08\
They could ride\
on the bus to Lima\
9:11\
if they were willing\
to sit on the floor\
9:14\
of the bus for the entire\
five-day and five-night ride.\
9:22\
They chose to do this.\
9:25\
She said it was difficult, even\
though some riders sometimes\
9:30\
let them sit in their seats\
so they could stretch out\
9:34\
on the floor.\
9:36\
What impressed me in her talk\
was this sister's statement\
9:40\
that she was grateful\
she and her husband\
9:42\
had been able to go to\
the temple in this way,\
9:45\
because it changed\
the way they felt\
9:48\
about the gospel and the\
way they felt about marriage\
9:51\
in the temple.\
9:52\
The Lord had rewarded\
them with the growth\
9:56\
that comes from sacrifice.\
9:59\
She also observed that their\
five-day trip to the temple\
10:03\
accomplished a great deal more\
in building their spirituality\
10:08\
than many visits to the temple\
that were sacrifice free.\
10:15\
In the years since I\
heard that testimony,\
10:17\
I have wondered how different\
that young couple's life would\
10:20\
have been if they had made\
another choice--foregoing\
10:25\
the sacrifice necessary to\
be married in the temple.\
10:31\
Brethren, we make\
countless choices in life,\
10:34\
some large and some\
seemingly small.\
10:38\
Looking back, we can see\
what a great difference some\
10:42\
of our choices\
made in our lives.\
10:44\
We make better\
choices and decisions\
10:48\
if we look at the\
alternatives and ponder\
10:52\
where they will lead.\
10:55\
As we do, we will be following\
President Russell M. Nelson's\
10:58\
counsel to begin\
with the end in mind.\
11:02\
For us, the end is always\
on the covenant path\
11:07\
through the temple\
to eternal life,\
11:11\
the greatest of all\
the gifts of God.\
11:16\
I testify of Jesus Christ and\
of the effects of His Atonement\
11:21\
and the other truths of\
His everlasting gospel\
11:26\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
