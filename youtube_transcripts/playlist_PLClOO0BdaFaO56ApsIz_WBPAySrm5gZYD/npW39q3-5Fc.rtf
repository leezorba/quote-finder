Shortly before His Crucifixion,\
Jesus was taken before Pilate\
0:06\
in the judgment hall.\
0:07\
"Art thou the King of the Jews?"\
0:10\
Pilate condescendingly asked.\
0:12\
Jesus responded: "My kingdom\
is not of this world. ...\
0:17\
I [came] into the world,\
that I should bear\
0:19\
witness [of] the truth.\
0:21\
Every one that is of the\
truth heareth my voice."\
0:26\
Pilot cynically asked,\
"What is truth?"\
0:31\
In today's world, the\
question "What is truth?"\
0:34\
can be painfully complex\
to the secular mind.\
0:38\
A Google search for\
"What is truth?"\
0:40\
brings more than a\
million responses.\
0:43\
We have more available\
information on our cell phones\
0:47\
than in all the books of a\
brick and mortar library.\
0:51\
We live with information\
and opinion overload.\
0:55\
Enticing and alluring voices\
pursue us at every turn.\
1:00\
Caught in today's\
confusion, it is no wonder\
1:04\
that so many consign\
themselves to the words spoken\
1:10\
2,500 years ago by Protagoras\
to the young Socrates.\
1:14\
"What is true for you,"\
he said, "is true for you,\
1:19\
and what is true for\
me, is true for me."\
1:25\
Blessed with the restored\
gospel of Jesus Christ,\
1:28\
we humbly declare that there are\
some things that are completely\
1:33\
and absolutely true.\
1:35\
These eternal truths are the\
same for every son and daughter\
1:40\
of God.\
1:42\
The scriptures teach,\
"Truth is knowledge\
1:45\
of things as they\
are, and as they were,\
1:48\
and as they are to come."\
1:51\
Truth looks backward\
and forward,\
1:54\
expanding the perspective\
of our small point in time.\
1:59\
Jesus said, "I am the way,\
the truth, and the life."\
2:04\
Truth shows us the\
way to eternal life,\
2:08\
and it comes only through\
our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
2:12\
There is no other way.\
2:16\
Jesus Christ teaches\
us how to live,\
2:18\
and through His Atonement\
and Resurrection,\
2:21\
He offers us forgiveness\
from our sins\
2:24\
and immortality beyond the veil.\
2:27\
This is absolutely true.\
2:31\
He teaches us that\
it does not matter\
2:33\
if we are rich or poor,\
prominent or unknown,\
2:38\
sophisticated or simple.\
2:41\
Rather, our mortal quest\
is to strengthen our faith\
2:45\
in the Lord Jesus Christ,\
to choose good over evil,\
2:49\
and to keep His commandments.\
2:51\
While we celebrate the\
innovations of science\
2:54\
and medicine, the\
truths of God go\
2:57\
far beyond these discoveries.\
3:01\
In opposition to the\
truths of eternity,\
3:04\
there always have been\
counterfeits to distract\
3:07\
God's children from the truth.\
3:09\
The arguments of the\
adversary are always the same.\
3:13\
Listen to these voices\
2,000 years ago:\
3:19\
"[You] cannot know of\
things [you] do not see. ...\
3:23\
[Whatever a person\
does is] no crime."\
3:27\
"It is not reasonable\
that such a being as ...\
3:31\
Christ ... [would]\
be the Son of God."\
3:34\
["What you believe is a foolish\
tradition."] Sounds like today,\
3:40\
doesn't it?\
3:43\
With the Restoration\
of the gospel,\
3:45\
God has given us a\
way to learn and know\
3:48\
essential spiritual\
truths: we learn them\
3:51\
through the holy scriptures,\
through our personal prayers\
3:54\
and our own experiences, through\
the counsel of living prophets\
3:59\
and apostles, and through the\
guidance of the Holy Ghost, who\
4:03\
can help us "know the\
truth of all things."\
4:08\
We can know the things of God\
as we seek them spiritually.\
4:13\
Paul said, "The things\
of God knoweth no man,\
4:17\
except he has the\
Spirit of God. ...\
4:19\
[For] they are\
spiritually discerned."\
4:23\
Look at this art\
by Michael Murphy.\
4:26\
From this perspective,\
you would hardly\
4:29\
believe that it is an artistic\
rendition of a human eye.\
4:33\
However, as you look at the dots\
from a different perspective,\
4:38\
you see the beauty of\
the artist's creation.\
4:42\
Likewise, we see the\
spiritual truths of God\
4:45\
through the perspective\
of an eye of faith.\
4:48\
Paul said: "The\
natural man receiveth\
4:52\
not the things of\
the Spirit of God:\
4:54\
for they are\
foolishness unto him:\
4:56\
neither can he know\
them, because they\
4:59\
are spiritually discerned."\
5:03\
I did not know the subject\
of Elder Hales's sermon\
5:08\
until he just gave it, but\
didn't he teach us beautifully\
5:11\
about the eye of faith?\
5:14\
The scriptures, our prayers,\
our own experiences,\
5:19\
modern prophets, and the\
gift of the Holy Ghost\
5:23\
bring us the\
spiritual perspective\
5:25\
of truth necessary for\
our journey here on earth.\
5:31\
Let's look at the\
proclamation of the family\
5:33\
through the eye of faith.\
5:36\
President Gordon B.\
Hinckley introduced\
5:38\
"The Family: A Proclamation to\
the World" with this statement:\
5:43\
"With so much of sophistry\
that is passed off as truth,\
5:48\
with so much of deception\
concerning standards\
5:52\
and values, with so much of\
allurement and enticement\
5:57\
to take on the slow\
stain of the world,\
6:00\
we have felt to warn [you]."\
6:05\
THE PROCLAMATION BEGINS:\
"All human beings--male\
6:09\
and female--are created\
in the image of God.\
6:13\
Each is a beloved spirit son or\
daughter of heavenly parents,\
6:17\
and, as such, each has a\
divine nature and destiny."\
6:23\
These are eternal truths.\
6:26\
You and I are not an\
accident of nature.\
6:30\
I LOVE THESE WORDS: "In\
the premortal realm,\
6:34\
spirit sons and daughters\
knew and worshipped God\
6:38\
as their Eternal Father\
and accepted His plan."\
6:43\
We lived before our birth.\
6:45\
Our individual identity\
is stamped in us forever.\
6:50\
In ways we don't\
fully understand,\
6:53\
our spiritual growth there\
in the premortal world\
6:57\
influences who we are here.\
7:00\
We accepted God's plan.\
7:03\
We knew that we would experience\
difficulties, pain, and sorrow\
7:07\
upon the earth.\
7:09\
We also knew that\
the Savior would come\
7:12\
and that as we proved\
ourselves worthy,\
7:14\
we would rise in\
the Resurrection,\
7:17\
having "glory added upon [our]\
heads for ever and ever."\
7:24\
THE PROCLAMATION IS\
DIRECT: "We declare\
7:27\
the means by which\
mortal life is created\
7:30\
to be divinely appointed.\
7:32\
We affirm the sanctity of\
life and of its importance\
7:37\
in God's eternal plan."\
7:40\
Our Father's plan encourages\
a husband and a wife\
7:44\
to bring children into\
the world and obligates\
7:47\
us to speak in\
defense of the unborn.\
7:52\
If we pick and choose what we\
accept in the proclamation,\
7:56\
we cloud our eternal view,\
putting too much importance\
8:01\
on our experience here and now.\
8:04\
By prayerfully pondering\
the proclamation\
8:07\
through the eye of\
faith, we better\
8:10\
understand how the principles\
are beautifully connected,\
8:15\
supporting one another,\
revealing our Father's\
8:18\
plan for His children.\
8:23\
Should we really\
be surprised when\
8:25\
the Lord's prophets declare\
His will and, for some,\
8:28\
questions remain?\
8:30\
Of course, some reject the voice\
of the prophets immediately;\
8:35\
but others prayerfully\
ponder their honest\
8:38\
questions--questions that\
will be settled with patience\
8:42\
and an eye of faith.\
8:44\
If the proclamation\
had been revealed\
8:47\
in a different century,\
there would still\
8:50\
have been questions,\
just different questions\
8:53\
than those of today.\
8:55\
One purpose of\
prophets is to help us\
8:58\
in resolving sincere questions.\
9:02\
Prior to being the\
President of the Church,\
9:04\
President Russell M. Nelson\
said this: "Prophets see ahead.\
9:09\
They see the harrowing dangers\
the adversary has placed\
9:13\
or will yet place in our path.\
9:16\
Prophets also foresee the grand\
possibilities and privileges\
9:21\
awaiting those who listen\
with the intent to obey."\
9:29\
I testify to the truth\
and spiritual power\
9:32\
of the united voice of\
the First Presidency\
9:35\
and the Quorum of the Twelve.\
9:39\
In my lifetime, we have seen a\
dramatic change in the world's\
9:43\
beliefs about many of\
the principles taught\
9:45\
in the proclamation.\
9:47\
During my teenage and\
early married years,\
9:51\
many in the world walked\
away from the Lord's standard\
9:54\
we call the law of chastity,\
that sexual relations\
9:58\
are to occur only between a\
man and woman who are lawfully\
10:02\
married.\
10:03\
In my 20s and 30s,\
many walked away\
10:07\
from the sacred\
protection of the unborn\
10:09\
as abortion became\
more acceptable.\
10:12\
In more recent years, many\
have walked away from God's law\
10:17\
that marriage is a sacred union\
between a man and a woman.\
10:23\
Watching many walking away from\
the boundaries the Lord has set\
10:27\
reminds us of that day in\
Capernaum when the Savior\
10:31\
declared His\
divinity, and sadly,\
10:33\
"many of his disciples\
... walked [away]."\
10:37\
The Savior then turned to the\
Twelve: "Will ye also go away?"\
10:43\
PETER ANSWERED: "Lord,\
to whom shall we go?\
10:48\
thou hast the words\
of eternal life.\
10:53\
"And we believe and are sure\
that thou art that Christ,\
10:59\
the Son of the living God."\
11:04\
There are so many,\
young and old,\
11:06\
who are loyal and true to\
the gospel of Jesus Christ,\
11:09\
even though their own current\
experience does not fit neatly\
11:13\
inside the family\
proclamation: children\
11:17\
whose lives have been\
shaken by divorce;\
11:20\
youth whose friends mock\
the law of chastity;\
11:24\
divorced women and men who\
have been gravely wounded\
11:28\
by the unfaithfulness\
of a spouse;\
11:31\
husbands and wives who are\
unable to have children;\
11:36\
women and men who are married\
to a spouse who does not\
11:40\
share their faith in the\
restored gospel; single women\
11:44\
and men who, for\
various reasons,\
11:47\
have been unable to marry.\
11:51\
One friend of nearly 20\
years, whom I admire greatly,\
11:55\
is not married because\
of same-sex attraction.\
11:59\
He has remained true to\
his temple covenants,\
12:02\
has expanded his creative\
and professional talents,\
12:05\
and has served nobly in both\
the Church and the community.\
12:09\
He recently said to\
me, "I can sympathize\
12:15\
with those in my\
situation who choose\
12:18\
not to keep the law of chastity\
in the world in which we live.\
12:22\
But didn't Christ ask us\
to be 'not of this world'?\
12:27\
It is clear that God's standards\
are different from those\
12:32\
of the world."\
12:35\
For those desiring\
to please God,\
12:37\
faith, patience, and\
diligence are surely needed.\
12:43\
Often, the laws of man move\
outside the laws of God.\
12:51\
My wife, Kathy, and I have\
known a single sister, now\
12:55\
in her mid-40s, who is gifted\
in her professional abilities\
12:59\
and serves valiantly\
in her ward.\
13:02\
She too, has kept\
the laws of God.\
13:05\
She wrote:\
13:07\
"I dreamed of the day\
I would be blessed\
13:09\
with a husband and children.\
13:11\
At times, my situation brings\
feelings of being forgotten\
13:16\
and alone, but I try to keep\
the focus off what I don't have\
13:23\
and instead on what I do have\
and how I can help others.\
13:28\
"Service to my extended family,\
in my ward, and in the temple\
13:32\
has helped me.\
13:33\
I am not forgotten\
or alone because I\
13:38\
am part of, and we are all\
part of, a larger family."\
13:45\
Some will say, "You don't\
understand my situation."\
13:50\
I may not, but I testify there\
is One who does understand.\
13:56\
There is One who\
knows your burdens\
13:59\
because of His sacrifice made\
in the garden and on the cross.\
14:03\
As you seek Him and\
keep His commandments,\
14:07\
I promise you that He will bless\
you and lift the burdens too\
14:12\
heavy to bear alone.\
14:14\
He will give you eternal friends\
and opportunities to serve.\
14:18\
More importantly,\
He will fill you\
14:21\
with the powerful\
spirit of the Holy Ghost\
14:24\
and shine His heavenly\
approval upon you.\
14:27\
No choice, no\
alternative, that denies\
14:32\
the companionship\
of the Holy Ghost\
14:34\
or the blessings of eternity\
is worthy of our consideration.\
14:40\
I know the Savior lives.\
14:44\
I witness that He is the\
source of all truth that really\
14:48\
matters and that He will\
fulfill all the blessings He\
14:52\
has promised to those who\
keep His commandments.\
14:56\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
