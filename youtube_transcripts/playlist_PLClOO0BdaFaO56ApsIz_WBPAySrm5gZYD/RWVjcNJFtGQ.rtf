Several years ago, our\
five-year-old son came to me\
0:04\
and announced, "Dad, I've\
figured something out.\
0:08\
I've figured out\
that 'soon,' for you,\
0:12\
is a very long time for me."\
0:15\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:19\
When the Lord or\
His servants say\
0:21\
things like "Not many\
days hence" or "The time\
0:25\
is not far distant,"\
it can literally\
0:27\
mean a lifetime or longer.\
0:29\
His time, and frequently His\
timing, is different from ours.\
0:34\
Patience is key.\
0:36\
Without it, we can neither\
develop nor demonstrate faith\
0:40\
in God unto life and salvation.\
0:42\
But my message today is that\
even while we are patiently\
0:46\
waiting upon the Lord, there\
are certain blessings that\
0:50\
come to us immediately.\
0:54\
When Alma and his people were\
captured by the Lamanites,\
0:56\
they prayed for deliverance.\
0:58\
They were not\
immediately delivered,\
1:01\
but while they patiently\
waited for deliverance,\
1:04\
the Lord showed\
forth His goodness\
1:05\
with certain\
immediate blessings.\
1:08\
He immediately softened\
the hearts of the Lamanites\
1:11\
so they wouldn't slay them.\
1:12\
He also strengthened Alma's\
people and eased their burdens.\
1:16\
When they finally\
were delivered,\
1:19\
they traveled to\
Zarahemla, where\
1:20\
they recounted their experience\
to an amazed audience.\
1:24\
The people of\
Zarahemla marveled,\
1:28\
and "when they thought of the\
immediate goodness of God,\
1:33\
and his power in delivering\
Alma and his brethren out of ...\
1:37\
bondage, they did raise their\
voices and give thanks to God."\
1:44\
The immediate\
goodness of God comes\
1:47\
to all who call upon\
Him with real intent\
1:50\
and full purpose of heart.\
1:52\
This includes those who cry\
out in earnest desperation,\
1:57\
when deliverance seems so\
distant and suffering seems\
2:01\
prolonged, even intensified.\
2:05\
So it was with a young prophet\
who suffered to the brink\
2:08\
in the dank of a dungeon before\
finally crying out, "O God,\
2:12\
where art thou? ...\
2:14\
How long shall thy\
hand be stayed ...?\
2:17\
Yea, O Lord, how long?"\
2:20\
In response, the Lord did not\
immediately deliver Joseph,\
2:25\
but He did immediately\
pronounce peace.\
2:31\
God also gives immediate hope\
for eventual deliverance.\
2:36\
No matter what, no matter where,\
in Christ and through Christ\
2:40\
there is always hope\
smiling brightly before us.\
2:44\
Immediately before us.\
2:48\
Moreover, He has\
promised, "My kindness\
2:51\
shall not depart from thee."\
2:54\
Above all, God's\
love is immediate.\
2:57\
With Paul, I\
testify that nothing\
3:00\
can "separate us from\
the love of God, which\
3:02\
is in Christ Jesus."\
3:03\
Even our sins, though they may\
separate us from His Spirit\
3:07\
for a time, cannot separate\
us from the constancy\
3:12\
and immediacy of His\
divine paternal love.\
3:17\
These are just some of the\
ways and means by which "he\
3:21\
doth immediately bless [us]."\
3:24\
Now, to bring these\
principles current and close,\
3:28\
I share with you the\
experiences of two people\
3:30\
whose lives stand as testaments\
of the immediate goodness\
3:35\
of God.\
3:38\
From the time she\
was a young teen,\
3:40\
Emilie struggled\
with substance abuse.\
3:43\
Experimentation led to\
habit, and habit eventually\
3:46\
hardened into an addiction that\
held her captive for years,\
3:49\
notwithstanding occasional\
periods of wellness.\
3:53\
Emilie carefully\
concealed her problem,\
3:56\
especially after she\
became a wife and mother.\
4:01\
The beginning of her\
deliverance did not\
4:04\
feel like deliverance at all.\
4:06\
One minute Emilie was undergoing\
a routine medical exam,\
4:10\
and the next she was\
being driven by ambulance\
4:13\
to an inpatient\
treatment facility.\
4:15\
She began to panic\
as she thought\
4:17\
of being separated from\
her children, her husband,\
4:20\
her home.\
4:23\
That night, alone in\
a cold, dark room,\
4:27\
Emilie curled up on\
her bed and sobbed.\
4:31\
Her ability to reason\
diminished until finally,\
4:34\
overcome with anxiety, fear,\
and the oppressive darkness\
4:38\
in that room and in her\
soul, Emilie actually thought\
4:43\
she would die that night.\
4:45\
Alone.\
4:48\
In that desperate\
condition, Emilie somehow\
4:51\
summoned the strength to roll\
off the bed and onto her knees.\
4:56\
Without any posturing\
that had sometimes\
4:59\
been part of her\
previous prayers,\
5:01\
Emilie completely surrendered\
herself to the Lord\
5:04\
as she desperately pleaded,\
"Dear God, I need you.\
5:09\
Please help me.\
5:11\
I don't want to be alone.\
5:13\
Please get me\
through this night."\
5:17\
And immediately, as He had\
done with Peter of old,\
5:21\
Jesus stretched forth His hand\
and caught her sinking soul.\
5:27\
There came over Emilie a\
wondrous calm, courage,\
5:31\
assurance, and love.\
5:33\
The room was no longer cold.\
5:37\
She knew she was not alone,\
and for the first time\
5:40\
since she was 14\
years old, Emilie\
5:45\
knew everything\
would be all right.\
5:48\
As she "awoke unto God,"\
Emilie fell asleep in peace.\
5:56\
And thus we see that "if\
ye will repent and harden\
6:00\
not your hearts,\
immediately shall\
6:03\
the great plan of redemption\
be brought about unto you."\
6:07\
Emilie's healing, her recovery\
and ultimate deliverance,\
6:11\
took months--a long time--with\
of treatment, training,\
6:15\
and counseling, during which\
she was sustained and sometimes\
6:20\
carried by His goodness.\
6:23\
And that goodness\
continued with her\
6:26\
as she entered the temple\
with her husband and children\
6:29\
to be sealed together forever.\
6:35\
Like the people of\
Zarahemla, Emilie now\
6:38\
gives thanks as she reflects on\
the immediate goodness of God\
6:43\
and His power in delivering\
her from bondage.\
6:49\
Now, from the life of\
another brave believer.\
6:52\
On December 27, 2013,\
Alicia Schroeder joyfully\
6:58\
welcomed her dear friends\
Sean and Sharla Chilcote,\
7:01\
who unexpectedly showed\
up on her doorstep.\
7:04\
Sean, who was also\
Alicia's bishop,\
7:08\
handed her his cell\
phone and solemnly said,\
7:13\
"Alicia, we love you.\
7:17\
You need to take this call."\
7:20\
Alicia's husband,\
Mario, was on the phone.\
7:22\
He was in a remote area\
with some of their children\
7:25\
on a long-anticipated\
snowmobile trip.\
7:28\
There had been a\
terrible accident.\
7:30\
Mario was seriously injured, and\
their 10-year-old son, Kaleb,\
7:36\
was gone.\
7:40\
When Mario tearfully told\
Alicia of Kaleb's death,\
7:44\
she was overcome with a\
shock and horror few of us\
7:47\
will ever know.\
7:48\
It dropped her.\
7:50\
Paralyzed with\
unspeakable anguish,\
7:53\
Alicia could neither\
speak nor move.\
7:57\
Bishop and Sister Chilcote\
quickly lifted her up\
7:59\
and held her.\
8:00\
They wept and deeply grieved\
together for some time.\
8:06\
Then Bishop Chilcote offered\
to give Alicia a blessing.\
8:11\
What happened next\
is incomprehensible\
8:14\
without some understanding of\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ\
8:18\
and the immediate\
goodness of God.\
8:23\
Bishop Chilcote gently placed\
his hands on Alicia's head\
8:27\
and, with quivering\
voice, began to speak.\
8:31\
Alicia heard two things as\
though spoken by God Himself.\
8:37\
First, she heard her name,\
Alicia Susan Schroeder.\
8:43\
Then she heard the bishop invoke\
the authority of Almighty God.\
8:47\
In that instant--at the\
mere utterance of her name\
8:51\
and God's power--Alicia was\
filled with an indescribable\
8:56\
peace, love, comfort,\
and somehow, joy.\
9:03\
And it has continued with her.\
9:07\
Now, of course, Alicia,\
Mario, and their family\
9:10\
still mourn for and miss Kaleb.\
9:13\
It is hard!\
9:14\
Whenever I speak with\
them, Alicia's eyes\
9:17\
well up with tears as she tells\
how much she loves and misses\
9:21\
her little boy.\
9:23\
And her eyes remain moist as she\
tells how the Great Deliverer\
9:28\
has sustained her through\
every bit of her ordeal,\
9:32\
beginning with His\
immediate goodness\
9:36\
during her deepest\
despair, and continuing now\
9:41\
with the bright hope of a sweet\
reunion that is "not many days\
9:46\
hence."\
9:49\
I realize that sometimes\
life's experiences\
9:52\
create confusion\
and turbulence that\
9:54\
can make it difficult to\
receive or recognize or retain\
9:59\
the kind of relief that\
came to Emilie and Alicia.\
10:02\
I have been through such times.\
10:06\
I testify that\
during such times,\
10:10\
our mere preservation\
is a tender\
10:15\
and powerful manifestation of\
the immediate goodness of God.\
10:20\
Remember, ancient\
Israel was ultimately\
10:23\
delivered "by that same God who\
had preserved them" day to day.\
10:34\
I bear witness that Jesus\
Christ is the Great Deliverer,\
10:38\
and in His name I\
promise that as you\
10:42\
turn to Him with real intent\
and full purpose of heart,\
10:46\
He will deliver\
you from everything\
10:49\
that threatens to diminish\
or destroy your life or joy.\
10:55\
That deliverance may take longer\
than you would like--perhaps\
10:59\
a lifetime or longer.\
11:02\
So, to give you comfort,\
courage, and hope,\
11:06\
to sustain and strengthen\
you to that day\
11:09\
of ultimate deliverance,\
I commend to you\
11:14\
and testify of the\
immediate goodness of God,\
11:20\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
