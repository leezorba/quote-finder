My brothers and sisters,\
it is wonderful.\
0:06\
It's hard for me to believe\
it was 71 years ago, in 1948,\
0:10\
that I was a\
missionary in England\
0:14\
and 44 years ago that my\
wife, Barbara, and I took\
0:19\
our family to Canada when I was\
president of the Canada Toronto\
0:23\
Mission.\
0:24\
While serving there\
in 1976, I was\
0:28\
called to the First\
Quorum of the Seventy.\
0:31\
And unexpectedly, in 1985,\
I was called to the Quorum\
0:35\
of the Twelve Apostles.\
0:37\
Unlike my previous callings\
that included future releases,\
0:43\
my release from my\
calling to the Twelve\
0:46\
is not the best\
option right now.\
0:49\
However, I pray\
the day will come\
0:53\
only after I've finished all\
the Lord has called me to do.\
0:59\
Thinking about my last\
43 years of service\
1:04\
as a General Authority\
and the privilege\
1:07\
I have had to minister to\
Heavenly Father's children,\
1:10\
I've come to realize\
more fully that He wants\
1:15\
all of His children\
to find peace, joy,\
1:18\
and happiness in their lives.\
1:20\
The prophet Lehi\
taught, "Men [and women]\
1:24\
are, that they might have joy."\
1:26\
There are many reasons why\
peace, joy, and happiness may\
1:31\
elude us in this life,\
including poverty\
1:34\
and war and natural disasters\
and unexpected setbacks\
1:38\
in employment, health,\
and family relationships.\
1:42\
But even though we cannot\
control those eternal forces\
1:48\
that impact our\
lives here on earth,\
1:51\
as we strive to become faithful\
disciples of the Lord Jesus\
1:55\
Christ, we can find\
peace, joy, and happiness,\
2:01\
despite the world's troubles\
that swirl around us.\
2:07\
One of my children\
once said, "Dad,\
2:10\
I wonder if I will ever\
be able to make it."\
2:13\
I responded, "All\
Heavenly Father\
2:17\
asks of us is to do the\
very best we can each day."\
2:22\
Brothers and sisters, do\
the very best you can,\
2:27\
day after day, and\
before you know it,\
2:30\
you'll come to realize that\
your Heavenly Father knows you\
2:35\
and that He loves you.\
2:36\
And when you know that--really\
know it--your life will have\
2:41\
real purpose and meaning, and\
you will be filled with peace\
2:46\
and joy.\
2:48\
As the Light of the\
World, the Savior said,\
2:51\
"Whosoever believeth on me\
should not abide in darkness."\
2:57\
"Jesus ... is the name which\
is given of the Father,\
3:01\
and there is none other name\
given whereby [we] can be\
3:05\
saved;\
3:06\
"Wherefore, all men [and women]\
must take upon them the name\
3:12\
which is given of the Father."\
3:15\
The scriptures teach\
us that Satan desires\
3:18\
to lead people into darkness.\
3:20\
His every effort is to shut\
out the light and truth\
3:25\
of Jesus Christ and His gospel.\
3:27\
As Lehi taught his\
children, the devil\
3:31\
"seeketh that all men might be\
miserable like unto himself."\
3:36\
If Heavenly Father's\
"work and ... glory"\
3:39\
is "to bring to pass the\
immortality and eternal life\
3:43\
of [men and women],"\
Lucifer's "work"\
3:45\
is to bring to pass the\
misery and endless woe\
3:49\
for God's children.\
3:50\
Sin and transgression dim the\
Light of Christ in our lives.\
3:56\
That is why our quest is to bask\
in the Light of Christ, which\
4:03\
brings peace, joy,\
and happiness.\
4:07\
In the last 18\
months, the Lord has\
4:09\
inspired His prophet\
and the Apostles\
4:12\
to implement a number of\
wonderful adjustments.\
4:16\
However, I worry that\
the spiritual purposes\
4:19\
of these adjustments\
might become\
4:22\
lost in the excitement about\
the changes themselves.\
4:27\
JOSEPH F. SMITH SAID: "The true,\
pure, simple gospel of Jesus\
4:33\
Christ has been restored.\
4:36\
We are responsible for\
maintaining it upon the earth."\
4:41\
He added that the true,\
pure, and simple gospel\
4:46\
is the "saving\
doctrine of Christ."\
4:50\
In the Articles of Faith,\
the Prophet Joseph Smith\
4:53\
taught that "through\
the Atonement of Christ,\
4:58\
all mankind may be saved,\
by obedience to the laws\
5:03\
and ordinances of the Gospel."\
5:06\
The first principles\
of the gospel\
5:08\
are faith in the Lord Jesus\
Christ, repentance, baptism,\
5:14\
the gift of the Holy Ghost,\
and enduring to the end.\
5:18\
His brother Hyrum taught,\
"Preach them [over and]\
5:23\
over again: you\
will find that day\
5:26\
after day new ideas\
and additional light\
5:30\
concerning them will\
be revealed to you.\
5:33\
You can enlarge upon them ...\
to comprehend them clearly.\
5:37\
You will then be able to make\
them more plainly understood\
5:43\
by those [you] teach."\
5:47\
The best ways for us to\
see the spiritual purposes\
5:50\
of the Church is to\
live the true, pure,\
5:54\
and simple teachings of Christ\
and also apply the Savior's two\
5:59\
great commandments: "Thou shalt\
love the Lord thy God with all\
6:05\
thy heart. ...\
6:06\
Thou shalt love thy\
neighbor as thyself."\
6:10\
Obedience to those\
two commandments\
6:13\
provides a way to experience\
more peace and joy.\
6:17\
When we love and serve the\
Lord and love and serve\
6:20\
our neighbors, we will naturally\
feel more happiness that\
6:24\
comes to us in no better way.\
6:28\
Loving God and\
loving our neighbors\
6:31\
is the doctrinal\
foundation of ministering;\
6:34\
home-centered,\
Church-supported learning;\
6:37\
Sabbath-day spiritual worship;\
and the work of salvation\
6:41\
on both sides of the veil\
supported in the Relief\
6:44\
Societies and the\
elders quorums.\
6:46\
All of these things are based\
on the divine commandments\
6:50\
to love God and to\
love our neighbors.\
6:54\
Can there be anything more\
basic, more fundamental,\
6:58\
and more simple than that?\
7:01\
Living the true, pure,\
and simple gospel plan\
7:05\
will allow us more time to\
visit the widows, the widowers,\
7:09\
the orphans, the lonely,\
the sick and poor.\
7:13\
We will find peace, joy,\
and happiness in our life\
7:17\
when serving the Lord\
and our neighbors.\
7:21\
The Sabbath-day\
adjustments that emphasize\
7:24\
home-centered, Church-supported\
gospel learning and studying\
7:28\
are an opportunity to renew\
our spirit and our devotion\
7:32\
to God within the\
walls of our own homes.\
7:35\
What possibly could be more\
simple, basic, and profound?\
7:42\
Brothers and sisters, can you\
see that learning and teaching\
7:46\
the gospel in our families\
is an important way\
7:50\
to find peace and\
happiness in our lives?\
7:55\
Speaking of the\
Sabbath, the Savior\
7:57\
said, "For verily this\
is a day appointed unto\
8:01\
you to rest from your labors,\
and to pay thy devotions\
8:06\
unto the Most High."\
8:07\
He added, "That thy\
joy may be full ...\
8:11\
[through] rejoicing\
and prayer ...\
8:13\
ye [should] do these\
things with thanksgiving,\
8:16\
[and] with cheerful hearts\
and countenances ...\
8:19\
[and] with a glad heart and\
a cheerful countenance."\
8:24\
Please note some of the key\
words in this revelation:\
8:28\
joy, rejoicing, thanksgiving,\
cheerful hearts, glad heart,\
8:35\
and a cheerful countenance.\
8:37\
It sounds to me like Sabbath-day\
observance should bring a smile\
8:42\
on all of our faces.\
8:45\
As we minister in a\
higher and holier way,\
8:48\
please consider\
how essential it is\
8:51\
that we greet everyone\
who comes to our Church\
8:54\
meetings, especially new\
members and visitors.\
8:58\
We should all enjoy\
singing the hymns\
9:01\
and listening carefully to the\
words of the sacrament prayers\
9:05\
with an open heart and mind.\
9:08\
Testimonies of faith in our\
fast and testimony meetings\
9:12\
are led by a member\
of the bishopric, who\
9:15\
shares a brief testimony\
focused on the plan of happiness\
9:19\
and the true, pure, and\
simple gospel of Christ.\
9:24\
All others should\
follow that example.\
9:26\
We need to remember\
that there are\
9:29\
other appropriate places to\
tell stories or share travel\
9:34\
adventures.\
9:35\
As we keep our\
testimonies simple\
9:38\
and focused on the\
gospel of Christ,\
9:41\
He will provide\
spiritual renewal\
9:44\
as we share our testimonies\
with one another.\
9:48\
Effective ministering\
is best viewed\
9:51\
through the focused lens\
of loving God and loving\
9:55\
our neighbors.\
9:56\
Simply stated, we minister\
because we love our Heavenly\
10:00\
Father and His children.\
10:02\
Our ministering efforts will\
be more successful if we\
10:06\
keep our ministering simple.\
10:08\
The most joy comes from\
the simple things of life,\
10:12\
so we need to be careful not\
to think that more needs to be\
10:18\
added to any of the\
adjustments we have received\
10:22\
to build faith and strong\
testimonies in the hearts\
10:25\
of God's children.\
10:28\
Let's not complicate things\
with additional meetings,\
10:31\
expectations, or requirements.\
10:35\
Keep it simple.\
10:36\
It is in the simplicity\
that you will\
10:39\
find the peace,\
joy, and happiness\
10:42\
I have been talking about.\
10:45\
For years the leadership\
purposes of the general Church\
10:49\
hanbook in Handbook\
2 are outcomes\
10:53\
that are clear and simple,\
from which I quote:\
10:58\
"Leaders encourage every\
member to receive all essential\
11:02\
priesthood ordinances, keep\
the associated covenants,\
11:07\
and qualify for exaltation\
and eternal life. ...\
11:12\
"Adults: Encourage each\
adult to be worthy to receive\
11:16\
the ordinances of the temple.\
11:18\
Teach all adults to\
identify their ancestors\
11:21\
and perform vicarious\
temple ordinances for them.\
11:26\
"Youth: Help prepare\
each young man\
11:30\
to receive the\
Melchizedek Priesthood,\
11:32\
to receive the\
ordinances of the temple,\
11:35\
and to be worthy to serve\
a full-time mission.\
11:39\
Help prepare each\
young woman to be\
11:42\
worthy to make and\
keep sacred covenants\
11:45\
and receive the\
ordinances of the temple.\
11:48\
Strengthen youth\
through participation\
11:52\
in meaningful activities.\
11:54\
"All Members: Help priesthood\
and auxiliary leaders,\
11:59\
ward councils, ward and\
full-time missionaries,\
12:03\
and members work cooperatively\
in a balanced effort\
12:07\
to rescue individuals,\
strengthen families and Church\
12:12\
units, increase\
priesthood activity,\
12:16\
and gather Israel through\
conversion, retention,\
12:20\
and activation.\
12:22\
Teach members to provide for\
themselves and their families\
12:26\
and to assist the poor and\
needy in the Lord's way."\
12:33\
My service in the\
Church has blessed me\
12:36\
with many remarkable and\
special spiritual experiences.\
12:40\
I am a witness that the\
Lord directs His Church\
12:44\
to accomplish His purposes.\
12:46\
I have received divine guidance\
far beyond my capacity.\
12:51\
The joy of gospel\
living for me has\
12:55\
been centered on the true,\
pure, and simple doctrine\
12:59\
and the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
13:03\
I have served under\
the keys and directions\
13:05\
of six prophets and\
Church Presidents,\
13:08\
from Spencer W. Kimball\
to Russell M. Nelson.\
13:13\
I testify that each\
one of them was\
13:16\
and is God's chosen prophet.\
13:18\
They have taught us\
essential principles\
13:20\
about the Church and the gospel\
and the doctrine of Christ.\
13:25\
President Nelson is carrying\
the Lord's work forward\
13:29\
at a breathtaking pace.\
13:31\
I say "breathtaking"\
because he's\
13:34\
the only one of the Apostles\
who is older than me,\
13:38\
and I am having a difficult\
time keeping up with him!\
13:42\
I am a witness that\
the priesthood keys\
13:47\
and the mantle of a prophet\
of God are upon him.\
13:50\
President Nelson teaches the\
true, pure, and simple gospel\
13:57\
of Jesus Christ.\
13:58\
I bear my testimony that\
Jesus is the Christ,\
14:03\
and this is His Church--of which\
I testify humbly in the name\
14:09\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
