Last December, the First\
Presidency issued a statement\
0:04\
announcing that 11-year-olds\
would "begin attending ...\
0:08\
Aaronic Priesthood quorums ...\
at the beginning of January\
0:12\
in the year they turn 12."\
0:14\
As a result, during the\
first part of this year,\
0:16\
there were quite a few\
startled 11-year-old boys\
0:19\
who had assumed they\
would be staying\
0:21\
in Primary until\
their next birthday\
0:23\
but were now passing\
the sacrament on Sundays\
0:27\
as the Church's newest\
ordained deacons.\
0:31\
I wonder who was surprised\
most by the change--the deacons\
0:35\
or their parents?\
0:36\
Many of these--almost\
80,000--new deacons are with us\
0:41\
tonight in this great conference\
center or are participating\
0:46\
through technology.\
0:48\
Welcome to the great\
brotherhood of the priesthood!\
0:51\
This change makes this meeting\
an historic one--it is likely\
0:55\
the largest group of Aaronic\
Priesthood holders ever\
0:58\
to attend a general priesthood\
session of general conference.\
1:02\
In light of this\
special occasion,\
1:04\
I direct my remarks\
especially to the young men\
1:06\
of the Aaronic Priesthood.\
1:08\
As students, many\
of you are also\
1:10\
developing your talents,\
interests, and hobbies\
1:13\
through extracurricular\
activities at school\
1:16\
or in private lessons,\
teams, and groups outside\
1:20\
of school, including sports.\
1:23\
Having enjoyed sports\
throughout my life,\
1:26\
I have always admired\
those who develop\
1:28\
their athletic\
abilities to the point\
1:30\
where they perform\
at high levels.\
1:33\
For someone to be really\
good at anything, in addition\
1:37\
to natural talent, it takes\
great discipline, sacrifice,\
1:42\
and countless hours of\
training and practice.\
1:45\
Such athletes often hear the\
sometimes-harsh criticisms\
1:49\
of coaches and\
willingly put aside\
1:52\
what they want now for\
something greater in the future.\
1:57\
We know Church\
members and priesthood\
1:59\
holders who have\
experienced success\
2:01\
at the highest levels of\
professional athletics.\
2:04\
There are many good examples,\
but I can only list a few here\
2:09\
for the sake of time.\
2:11\
You might recognize some of\
these athletes: in baseball,\
2:15\
Jeremy Guthrie and Bryce Harper;\
in basketball, Jabari Parker\
2:22\
and Jimmer Fredette; in\
soccer, Ricardo Rojas;\
2:28\
and rugby league,\
William Hopoate;\
2:32\
and in football, Taysom\
Hill and Daniel Sorensen.\
2:38\
Each has made significant\
contributions to his sport.\
2:42\
While they are extremely\
successful in their sports,\
2:45\
these athletes would\
be the first to admit\
2:47\
that they are not\
perfect athletes\
2:50\
or perfect human beings.\
2:52\
They work hard to be the best\
in their sport--and to live\
2:54\
the gospel.\
2:55\
They get up if they\
stumble and they\
2:57\
strive to endure to the end.\
3:01\
In team sports,\
plays are developed\
3:03\
for certain game situations\
and compiled into a playbook.\
3:07\
Athletes learn their specific\
assignment for each play.\
3:12\
Successful players\
study the playbook so\
3:14\
thoroughly that when\
a play is called\
3:17\
they know exactly, almost\
instinctively, where to go\
3:21\
and what to do.\
3:23\
In a similar way, we holders\
of the priesthood also have\
3:28\
a team--a quorum, and a\
playbook--the holy scriptures\
3:34\
and words of modern prophets.\
3:38\
Do you strengthen\
your teammates?\
3:40\
How well have you\
studied your playbook?\
3:42\
Do you fully understand\
your assignment?\
3:46\
To take the analogy\
even further,\
3:48\
great coaches know the strengths\
and weaknesses of their team\
3:53\
as well as those\
of the opposition.\
3:55\
They create a game plan\
that will give them\
3:58\
the best chance for victory.\
3:59\
What about you?\
4:02\
You know what temptations\
you are most vulnerable to,\
4:04\
and you can predict how\
the adversary will try\
4:07\
to derail and dishearten you.\
4:10\
Have you created a personal\
game plan and playbook\
4:14\
so that you will\
know how to respond\
4:16\
when faced with opposition?\
4:20\
As you confront various\
moral temptations--whether\
4:24\
in the company of others or\
when you are alone staring\
4:28\
at a screen--you\
know the game plan.\
4:32\
If a friend suggests you\
drink alcohol or try drugs,\
4:36\
you know the play.\
4:38\
You have practiced and you\
know how to react in advance.\
4:41\
With a game plan, a playbook,\
and a firm commitment\
4:44\
to execute your role, you\
will find that temptation\
4:47\
has less control over you.\
4:50\
You will already have made the\
decision how you will react\
4:53\
and what you will do.\
4:55\
You won't need to\
decide every time you\
4:57\
are confronted with temptation.\
5:00\
One of the brethren\
recently shared a story that\
5:02\
illustrates this principle.\
5:04\
As a priest in high\
school, he was hanging out\
5:07\
with his friends.\
5:08\
After they got\
something to eat, they\
5:10\
were driving around when\
someone suggested they\
5:13\
should go to a certain movie.\
5:15\
Problem was he knew it was\
a movie he shouldn't see.\
5:20\
Although he immediately\
felt pressure and anxiety\
5:24\
about the situation, he\
had planned for this.\
5:27\
This was a page straight out\
of his priesthood playbook.\
5:32\
Taking a deep breath and\
summoning his courage,\
5:35\
he announced, "I'm not\
interested in that movie.\
5:38\
Just drop me off at my\
house," which they did.\
5:42\
A simple play\
leading to a victory!\
5:46\
Years later, one of the\
friends with him that night\
5:49\
described how this\
example proved\
5:52\
to be a great strength for\
him to courageously face\
5:56\
similar circumstances\
in his own life.\
6:00\
I asked a few of the\
Brethren to recommend\
6:02\
plays you might include\
in your playbook.\
6:04\
Here are some of their\
inspired suggestions:\
6:08\
Pray every day for greater\
light and a testimony\
6:10\
of Jesus Christ.\
6:12\
Listen carefully\
to the teachings\
6:13\
of your parents, bishop, and\
your Young Men and quorum\
6:16\
leaders.\
6:17\
Avoid pornography and\
immoral social media content.\
6:22\
Remember the promises\
you have made to God,\
6:24\
and work to keep them.\
6:27\
Study scripture stories\
of great prophets,\
6:29\
and emulate their\
good qualities.\
6:32\
Bless Heavenly Father's\
children through service.\
6:35\
Seek good friends\
to help you become\
6:38\
the person you want to be.\
6:40\
Become an expert in\
the FamilySearch app,\
6:43\
and research your\
own family history.\
6:46\
Plan places of retreat where\
you can escape evil influences.\
6:52\
Love and strengthen\
other members\
6:54\
of your priesthood quorum.\
6:56\
I also communicated with\
the athletes whose pictures\
6:59\
we viewed earlier.\
7:00\
I found it interesting that they\
do not identify themselves only\
7:04\
by what they do, as professional\
athletes--rather by who they\
7:09\
are, as sons of a loving\
Heavenly Father and holders\
7:13\
of the priesthood of God.\
7:15\
Now let's listen\
to their thoughts:\
7:18\
Jimmer Fredette, here as a\
deacon learning to tie his tie,\
7:22\
says: "I have learned\
to lean heavily\
7:25\
on my knowledge and faith of\
the truthfulness of the gospel.\
7:29\
This has guided me to be ...\
a worthy priesthood holder\
7:32\
and above all--a\
positive example."\
7:35\
Bryce Harper, here\
as a husband, writes:\
7:39\
"I thought fame, fortune, and an\
MVP award would make me happy.\
7:43\
Something was missing.\
7:45\
So, I ... prepared and\
[entered] the temple.\
7:48\
I am now on a path to [return]\
to my Heavenly Father and have\
7:52\
an eternal family--which is\
the greatest joy in the world!"\
7:56\
Daniel Sorensen, here\
as a missionary, says:\
8:00\
"A good playbook is a plan that\
uses the talents and strengths\
8:03\
of each team member. ...\
8:04\
As I study and\
practice the teachings\
8:06\
of the gospel of\
Jesus Christ, I can\
8:09\
know how to use my strengths\
to serve in the priesthood."\
8:13\
Jeremy Guthrie, here currently\
serving as mission president,\
8:18\
shared: "As a\
12-year-old deacon ...\
8:20\
[I felt] the Spirit testify\
to me [that] 'this life is\
8:24\
the time ... to\
prepare to meet God.'\
8:26\
The game plan is faith\
in God unto action [and]\
8:29\
repentance through the Savior.\
8:30\
...\
8:31\
The playbook is found\
in the holy scriptures\
8:33\
and through living prophets."\
8:36\
Jabari Parker, here\
at his ordination\
8:39\
to the office of elder,\
says: "I couldn't\
8:41\
imagine the person I\
would've turned out\
8:43\
to be if I hadn't made the\
decision to be baptized.\
8:47\
...\
8:47\
I'm so grateful I have God in\
my life to guide me every day."\
8:52\
Ricardo Rojas, here currently\
serving as branch president,\
8:56\
said: "Through\
[God's] priesthood\
8:58\
[we] can help in His work.\
9:00\
We are called to 'be strong\
and of a good courage'\
9:03\
in defending the truth."\
9:04\
This has helped him\
succeed both on the pitch\
9:07\
and as a priesthood holder.\
9:09\
Taysom Hill, here\
as a missionary,\
9:12\
feels the gospel\
of Jesus Christ has\
9:14\
served as a playbook\
for him in his life.\
9:17\
He shared, "Believing\
in [God's] plan\
9:20\
and doing my best to fulfill\
my role in it has given me\
9:23\
an overwhelming sense of\
peace and happiness in life,\
9:27\
knowing God is pleased\
with my efforts."\
9:31\
William Hopoate, here at his\
son's baby blessing with four\
9:36\
generations, says the\
gospel helps him "identify\
9:40\
the opposition's strategies and\
provides the spiritual efficacy\
9:45\
to withstand fiery darts\
and better serve others."\
9:50\
What about you?\
9:51\
Do you recognize your\
higher and holier identity\
9:54\
as a son of God, a bearer\
of His holy priesthood?\
9:58\
With this eternal\
identity in mind,\
10:01\
create your game plan\
and priesthood playbook\
10:04\
that will guide you during times\
of temptation and adversity.\
10:08\
Consider both offensive\
and defensive strategies.\
10:12\
Offensive strategies help\
strengthen testimonies\
10:15\
and increase resolve to stay\
on the strait and narrow path.\
10:19\
Examples include regular\
prayer, scripture study, church\
10:23\
and temple attendance,\
paying tithing,\
10:25\
and following the\
counsel found in the\
10:28\
For the Strength\
of Youth pamphlet.\
10:33\
Defensive strategies\
include planning ahead\
10:35\
how you will face temptation.\
10:37\
When tempted to compromise\
your personal standards,\
10:41\
you know beforehand\
what you will do.\
10:44\
You need a playbook for that.\
10:46\
Don't feel like praying today?\
10:48\
Time to execute the play\
you already game-planned.\
10:50\
Do you feel your\
testimony waning?\
10:53\
You have a play for that.\
10:55\
You know what to do.\
10:57\
You are bearers of the\
holy priesthood of God.\
11:00\
Your commitment to hold\
firmly the iron rod\
11:03\
will transform you\
into the eternal being\
11:06\
that you were created to become.\
11:08\
God knows you and loves you.\
11:10\
He will bless you\
and guide your steps.\
11:12\
You might be thinking that\
you are no one special,\
11:15\
that you are not\
all-star material.\
11:17\
But that is not true.\
11:19\
Don't you know that\
God has proclaimed,\
11:22\
"The weak things of the world\
shall come forth and break down\
11:25\
the mighty and strong ones"?\
11:28\
So, do you feel weak?\
11:29\
Insignificant?\
11:31\
Congratulations, you\
just made the lineup!\
11:34\
Do you feel unimportant?\
11:36\
Inferior?\
11:37\
You may be just who God needs.\
11:41\
What greater example\
is there than David\
11:43\
stepping onto the battlefield\
against a frightening opponent,\
11:47\
Goliath?\
11:48\
Relying on the\
Lord, with a plan,\
11:51\
David saved not only himself\
but the army of Israel!\
11:56\
Know that the Lord will be with\
you as you summon your courage\
12:00\
to be on His side.\
12:03\
"If God be for us, who\
can be against us?"\
12:07\
He can open doors and help us\
find strengths and abilities\
12:10\
we never knew we had.\
12:12\
Listen to your trusted coaches,\
such as your parents, bishop,\
12:17\
and Young Men leaders.\
12:18\
Learn the playbook.\
12:19\
Read the scriptures.\
12:20\
Study the words of\
modern-day prophets.\
12:22\
Create your own game plan of\
how you will prove yourself\
12:26\
as a disciple of Christ.\
12:29\
Know in advance\
the plays you will\
12:31\
employ to strengthen\
your spirit and avoid\
12:34\
the snares of the adversary.\
12:37\
Do this and God will\
surely utilize you.\
12:41\
Now, there may be some\
who detach themselves\
12:45\
from the gospel and wander away.\
12:46\
Others may sit in the stands\
and watch the game from afar\
12:50\
or choose to stay on the bench,\
even though the coach has\
12:52\
tried to send them in.\
12:54\
I invite you to rescue,\
support, and love them\
12:59\
as a fellow team member!\
13:02\
Others will want\
to get in the game.\
13:04\
What matters most\
is not how talented\
13:06\
they are but their willingness\
to put themselves on the field.\
13:10\
They do not have to\
wait for their number\
13:13\
to be called because they\
know the scriptures which\
13:16\
say, "If ye have\
desires to serve\
13:19\
God ye are called to the work."\
13:22\
You can put yourself\
in the lineup.\
13:24\
You do this as you\
study and execute\
13:26\
your priesthood playbook.\
13:29\
Along the way you will stumble\
and fall--perhaps many times.\
13:33\
You are not perfect; falling is\
part of the qualifying process\
13:37\
that refines your\
character and serve\
13:41\
in a more compassionate way.\
13:42\
The Savior and His\
infinite Atonement\
13:46\
provide the way to\
overcome our mistakes\
13:49\
through sincere repentance.\
13:52\
Great athletes spend\
hundreds of hours perfecting\
13:55\
one small aspect of their game.\
13:57\
As a priesthood holder,\
you need the same mindset.\
14:00\
If you fail, repent,\
learn from it,\
14:02\
and practice so you will\
do better next time.\
14:06\
Ultimately, it's up to you.\
14:08\
Will you learn the playbook?\
14:11\
I urge you: Trust in the Lord.\
14:13\
Put on the whole armor of\
God, and get in the game.\
14:16\
There aren't many who\
play professional sports\
14:18\
at the highest levels, but\
when it comes to discipleship,\
14:21\
there are many who\
choose to follow Christ.\
14:24\
In fact, that is your mission\
in this life--to learn the ways\
14:27\
of the Lord, enter the\
path of discipleship,\
14:30\
and strive to live\
according to God's plan.\
14:32\
God will uphold you and\
bless you as you turn to Him.\
14:35\
You can do this because you\
are an all-star in His eyes.\
14:39\
I pray you will\
make the commitment\
14:41\
to live worthy of\
the holy priesthood\
14:43\
that you bear and\
strive to execute\
14:46\
your sacred role every day.\
14:48\
I bless you with the\
ability and desire to do so.\
14:51\
I add my testimony of the\
power of the priesthood\
14:54\
that you hold, of\
living prophets,\
14:57\
and of Jesus Christ and His\
role as our Savior and Redeemer,\
15:01\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
