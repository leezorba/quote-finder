My dear brothers and\
sisters, dear friends,\
0:04\
last month the Twelve were\
invited by our dear prophet,\
0:07\
President Russell\
M. Nelson, to travel\
0:09\
with him to the dedication\
of the Rome Italy Temple.\
0:13\
While traveling, I thought\
about the Apostle Paul\
0:17\
and his journeys.\
0:19\
In his day, to get\
from Jerusalem to Rome,\
0:23\
it would have taken\
about 40 days.\
0:26\
Today, in one of my\
favorite airplanes,\
0:29\
it takes less than 3 hours.\
0:34\
Bible scholars\
believe that Paul was\
0:36\
in Rome when he wrote\
several of his letters, which\
0:40\
were key in strengthening Church\
members then as well as today.\
0:47\
Paul and the other members\
of the ancient Church,\
0:50\
the early-day Saints,\
were intimately\
0:54\
familiar with sacrifice.\
0:57\
Many were severely\
persecuted, even unto death.\
1:03\
In the last 200\
years, the members\
1:05\
of the restored Church of Jesus\
Christ, the Latter-day Saints,\
1:11\
have also experienced\
persecution in many forms.\
1:14\
But in spite of that persecution\
(and sometimes because of it),\
1:19\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints\
1:21\
has continued to grow and is\
now found all across the globe.\
1:26\
There is much to do.\
1:27\
However, before we bake\
a cake, throw confetti,\
1:32\
and congratulate ourselves\
on this remarkable success,\
1:36\
we would do well to put that\
growth into perspective.\
1:44\
There are roughly seven\
and a half billion people\
1:47\
in the world, compared to\
some 16 million members of The\
1:52\
Church of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints--a very small\
1:57\
flock indeed.\
1:59\
Meanwhile, the numbers\
of Christian believers\
2:02\
in some parts of the\
world are shrinking.\
2:06\
Even in the Lord's restored\
Church--while overall\
2:09\
membership continues to\
grow--there are too many who do\
2:14\
not claim the blessings of\
regular Church participation.\
2:20\
In other words, wherever\
you are on this earth,\
2:23\
there are plenty\
of opportunities\
2:25\
to share the good news of\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
2:30\
with people you meet, study, and\
live with or work and socialize\
2:37\
with.\
2:38\
During this past year, I have\
had the exciting opportunity\
2:41\
to be deeply involved with the\
worldwide missionary activities\
2:45\
of the Church.\
2:46\
I have often pondered and\
prayed about the Savior's great\
2:51\
commission to His disciples--us,\
His children--to "go ye\
2:58\
therefore, and\
teach all nations,\
3:02\
baptizing them in the name of\
the Father, and of the Son,\
3:07\
and of the Holy Ghost."\
3:09\
I wrestled with\
the question "How\
3:11\
can we, as members and\
disciples of Christ,\
3:16\
best fulfill that great\
commission in our daily lives?"\
3:24\
Today I invite you to\
ponder that same question\
3:27\
in your heart and mind.\
3:31\
Church leaders have emphasized\
the clarion call "Every member\
3:37\
a missionary!" for decades.\
3:39\
Members of the Church of Jesus\
Christ--both in past times\
3:42\
as well as in ours--have\
enthusiastically and joyfully\
3:47\
shared the gospel with\
friends and acquaintances.\
3:51\
Their hearts are aflame with\
the testimony of Jesus Christ,\
3:56\
and they sincerely want\
others to experience\
4:00\
the same joy they have found\
in the Savior's gospel.\
4:05\
Some members of the Church\
seem to have a gift for this.\
4:09\
They love being\
ambassadors of the gospel.\
4:12\
They boldly and\
gladly serve and lead\
4:14\
the work as member missionaries.\
4:17\
However, others of\
us are more hesitant.\
4:22\
When missionary work is\
discussed in Church meetings,\
4:26\
heads are slowly lowered until\
submerged behind the pew,\
4:31\
eyes focused on the scriptures\
or closed in deep meditation\
4:36\
to avoid eye contact\
with other members.\
4:41\
Why is this?\
4:43\
Maybe we feel guilty for not\
doing more to share the gospel.\
4:49\
Perhaps we feel uncertain\
about how to do it.\
4:53\
Or we might feel timid about\
going outside our comfort zone.\
4:59\
I understand this.\
5:01\
But remember, the Lord\
has never required\
5:04\
expert, flawless\
missionary efforts.\
5:07\
Instead, "the Lord requireth\
the heart and a willing mind."\
5:14\
If you are already happily\
doing missionary work,\
5:16\
please continue, and stand\
as one example to others.\
5:21\
The Lord will bless you.\
5:23\
If, however, you feel that you\
have been dragging your feet\
5:28\
when it comes to sharing\
the gospel message,\
5:31\
may I suggest five\
guilt-free things anyone\
5:38\
can do to participate in the\
Savior's great commission\
5:44\
to help gather Israel?\
5:47\
First, draw close to God.\
5:50\
The first great\
commandment is to love God.\
5:54\
It is a primary reason\
why we are on this earth.\
5:59\
Ask yourself, "Do I really\
believe in Heavenly Father?"\
6:03\
"Do I love and trust Him?"\
6:06\
The closer you draw to\
our Heavenly Father,\
6:09\
the more His light and joy\
will shine from within you.\
6:14\
Others will notice that there\
is something unique and special\
6:18\
about you.\
6:19\
And they will ask about it.\
6:22\
Second, fill your heart\
with love for others.\
6:27\
This is the second\
great commandment.\
6:30\
Try to truly feel and\
see everyone around you\
6:34\
as a child of God.\
6:37\
Minister to them--regardless\
of whether their names appear\
6:42\
on your ministering\
sister or brother list.\
6:46\
Laugh with them.\
6:47\
Rejoice with them.\
6:48\
Weep with them.\
6:49\
Respect them.\
6:50\
Heal, lift, and strengthen them.\
6:54\
Strive to emulate the love\
of Christ and have compassion\
6:57\
for others--even to those\
who are unkind to you,\
7:02\
who mock you and wish\
to cause you harm.\
7:06\
Love them and treat\
them as fellow children\
7:10\
of Heavenly Father.\
7:12\
Third, strive to walk\
the path of discipleship.\
7:17\
As your love for God and\
His children deepens,\
7:21\
so does your commitment\
to follow Jesus Christ.\
7:27\
You learn about His way\
by feasting upon His word\
7:30\
and heeding and applying the\
teachings of modern prophets\
7:34\
and apostles.\
7:36\
You grow in\
confidence and courage\
7:39\
to follow His way\
as you communicate\
7:42\
with Heavenly Father with\
a teachable, humble heart.\
7:48\
Walking the path of discipleship\
takes practice--each day,\
7:53\
little by little, "grace for\
grace," "line upon line."\
7:58\
Sometimes two steps\
forward and one step back.\
8:04\
The important thing is\
that you don't give up;\
8:07\
keep trying to get it right.\
8:09\
You will eventually\
become better, happier,\
8:12\
and more authentic.\
8:14\
Talking with others\
about your faith\
8:18\
will become normal and natural.\
8:22\
In fact, the gospel will be\
such an essential, precious part\
8:27\
of your lives that it\
would feel unnatural not\
8:32\
to talk about it with others.\
8:35\
That may not happen\
immediately--it is a lifelong\
8:42\
effort.\
8:42\
But it will happen.\
8:45\
Fourth, sharing what\
is in your heart.\
8:49\
I am not asking that\
you stand on a street\
8:53\
corner with a\
megaphone and shout out\
8:55\
Book of Mormon verses.\
8:57\
What I am asking is that you\
always look for opportunities\
9:03\
to bring up your faith in\
natural and normal ways with\
9:08\
people--both in person\
as well as online.\
9:13\
I am asking that you stand\
as a witness of the power\
9:19\
of the gospel at all times--and\
when necessary, use words.\
9:26\
Because "the gospel\
of Christ ...\
9:29\
is the power of God\
unto salvation,"\
9:32\
you can be confident,\
courageous,\
9:36\
and humble as you share it.\
9:40\
Confidence, courage,\
and humility\
9:42\
may seem like contradictory\
attributes, but they are not.\
9:47\
They reflect the\
Savior's invitation\
9:50\
not to hide gospel values\
and principles under a bushel\
9:55\
but to let your light shine,\
that your good works may\
10:00\
glorify your Father in Heaven.\
10:04\
There are many normal\
and natural ways\
10:06\
to do this, from\
daily acts of kindness\
10:09\
to personal testimonials on\
YouTube, Facebook, Instagram,\
10:17\
or Twitter, to\
simple conversations\
10:20\
with people you meet.\
10:23\
This year we are learning from\
the New Testament in our homes\
10:28\
and in Sunday School.\
10:29\
What a marvelous opportunity\
to invite friends and neighbors\
10:33\
to church and your homes\
to learn about the Savior\
10:38\
with you.\
10:40\
Share with them the\
Gospel Library app, where\
10:44\
they can find Come, Follow Me.\
10:47\
If you know young people\
and their families,\
10:50\
give them the For the\
Strength of Youth booklet,\
10:53\
and invite them to come and\
see how our young people strive\
10:59\
to live by those principles.\
11:02\
If someone asks\
about your weekend,\
11:05\
don't hesitate to talk about\
what you experienced at church.\
11:10\
Tell about the\
little children who\
11:13\
stood in front of a congregation\
and sang with eagerness how\
11:16\
they are trying\
to be like Jesus.\
11:20\
Talk about the group\
of youth who spent time\
11:23\
helping the elderly\
in rest homes\
11:25\
to compile personal histories.\
11:28\
Talk about the recent change\
in our Sunday meeting schedule\
11:32\
and how it blesses your family.\
11:35\
Or explain why we emphasize\
that this is the Church of Jesus\
11:43\
Christ and that we are\
Latter-day Saints, just\
11:49\
as the members of the ancient\
Church were also called Saints.\
11:55\
In whatever ways seem\
natural and normal to you,\
11:59\
share with people why\
Jesus Christ and His Church\
12:03\
are so important to you.\
12:06\
Invite them to "come and see."\
12:11\
Then encourage them\
to come and help.\
12:16\
There are numerous\
opportunities for people\
12:20\
to help in our church.\
12:24\
And pray not only for the\
missionaries to find the elect.\
12:28\
Pray daily with all\
your heart that you\
12:32\
will find those who\
will come and see, come\
12:37\
and help, and come and stay.\
12:41\
Keep the full-time\
missionaries in the loop.\
12:44\
They are like angels,\
ready to help!\
12:49\
As you share the good news,\
the gospel of Jesus Christ,\
12:54\
do so with love and patience.\
12:58\
If we interact with people\
with the sole expectation\
13:01\
that they soon will\
don a white jumpsuit\
13:05\
and ask for directions to\
the nearest baptismal font,\
13:09\
we're doing it wrong.\
13:13\
Some who come and see will,\
perhaps, never join the Church;\
13:20\
some will at a later time.\
13:23\
That is their choice.\
13:25\
But that doesn't change\
our love for them.\
13:27\
And it doesn't change\
our enthusiastic efforts\
13:30\
to continue inviting\
individuals and families\
13:33\
to come and see, come and\
help, and come and stay.\
13:41\
Fifth, trust the Lord\
to work His miracles.\
13:46\
We heard a wonderful message\
from Elder Hales about this.\
13:50\
Understand that it's not\
your job to convert people.\
13:57\
That is the role\
of the Holy Ghost.\
13:59\
Your role is to share\
what is in your heart\
14:03\
and live consistent\
with your beliefs.\
14:08\
So don't be discouraged\
if someone does not accept\
14:11\
the gospel message immediately.\
14:13\
It is not a personal failure.\
14:16\
That is between the individual\
and Heavenly Father.\
14:19\
Yours is to love God and love\
your neighbors, His children.\
14:27\
Believe, love, do.\
14:31\
Follow this path, and God\
will work miracles through you\
14:34\
to bless His precious children.\
14:37\
These five suggestions\
will help you\
14:41\
to do what disciples\
of Jesus Christ\
14:44\
have done since ancient times.\
14:46\
His gospel and His Church are\
an important part of your life\
14:52\
and of who you are\
and what you do.\
14:57\
Therefore, invite others to\
come and see and come and help,\
15:05\
and God will do His saving work,\
and they will come and stay.\
15:12\
"But," you might ask, "what\
if I do all this and people\
15:17\
react poorly?\
15:17\
What if they are critical\
about the Church?\
15:21\
What if they unfriend me?"\
15:26\
Yes, that may happen.\
15:29\
Since ancient times,\
disciples of Jesus Christ\
15:32\
have often been persecuted.\
15:34\
The Apostle Peter\
said, "Rejoice ...\
15:37\
as you share\
Christ's sufferings."\
15:40\
The early Saints\
rejoiced "that they\
15:42\
were counted worthy to\
suffer shame for his name."\
15:48\
Remember, the Lord works\
in His mysterious ways.\
15:53\
It may be that by your\
Christlike response\
15:56\
to rejection, a hardened\
heart could be softened.\
16:03\
As an Apostle of the\
Lord Jesus Christ,\
16:06\
I bless you with the confidence\
to be a living testimonial\
16:11\
of gospel values,\
with the courage\
16:15\
to always be recognized as a\
member of The Church of Jesus\
16:20\
Christ of Latter-day\
Saints, with the humility\
16:24\
to assist in His\
work as an expression\
16:28\
of your love for Heavenly\
Father and His children.\
16:32\
My dear friends,\
you will rejoice\
16:36\
in knowing that you\
are a significant part\
16:40\
in the long-foretold\
gathering of Israel,\
16:44\
preparing Christ's coming\
in "power and great glory;\
16:49\
with all the holy angels."\
16:52\
Heavenly Father knows you.\
16:54\
The Lord loves you.\
16:56\
God will bless you.\
16:58\
This work is ordained of Him.\
17:02\
You can do this.\
17:04\
We can all do this together.\
17:08\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
