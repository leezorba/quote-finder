I am grateful for the\
blessing of having\
0:03\
a physical body, which is an\
amazing gift from our Heavenly\
0:07\
Father.\
0:08\
Our bodies have\
over 600 muscles.\
0:11\
Many muscles require\
exercise in order\
0:14\
to be in condition to\
perform our daily activities.\
0:18\
We could expend much mental\
effort reading and learning\
0:22\
about our muscles,\
but if we think\
0:25\
this will make them stronger,\
we will be very disappointed.\
0:29\
Our muscles grow only\
when we use them.\
0:33\
I have come to realize\
that spiritual gifts behave\
0:37\
in the same way.\
0:38\
They also need to be\
exercised to grow.\
0:42\
The spiritual gift of\
faith, for example,\
0:45\
is not just a feeling or a mood;\
it is a principle of action\
0:50\
that frequently appears\
in the scriptures linked\
0:53\
to the verb exercise.\
0:55\
Just as reading and\
learning about muscles\
0:58\
is not enough to build\
muscle, reading and learning\
1:03\
about faith without\
adding action\
1:05\
is insufficient to build faith.\
1:08\
When I was 16 years old,\
my oldest brother, Ivan,\
1:12\
who was 22 at that\
time, came home one day\
1:17\
and shared some news\
with the family.\
1:19\
He had decided to get baptized\
in The Church of Jesus\
1:23\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
1:26\
Our parents looked at\
him somewhat skeptically,\
1:30\
and I remember not\
completely understanding\
1:33\
what was going on.\
1:35\
A year or so later, he gave\
us more surprising news:\
1:40\
he had decided to serve as a\
missionary of the Church, which\
1:44\
meant that we were not going\
to see him for two years.\
1:49\
My parents were not\
thrilled with this news;\
1:53\
however, I saw in him\
a clear determination\
1:57\
that increased my\
admiration for him\
2:01\
and the decision he had made.\
2:04\
Months later, while Ivan\
was serving his mission,\
2:08\
I had the opportunity to plan a\
vacation with some schoolmates.\
2:12\
We wanted to celebrate the\
end of our high school years\
2:16\
and spend a few\
days at the beach.\
2:19\
I wrote a letter to\
my missionary brother\
2:21\
mentioning my summer\
vacation plans.\
2:24\
He wrote back that the\
town he was serving in\
2:27\
was on the way to\
my destination.\
2:30\
I decided it would be a good\
idea to stop by and visit him.\
2:35\
It was not until\
later that I learned\
2:38\
that missionaries\
are not supposed\
2:39\
to be visited by family.\
2:43\
I made all the arrangements.\
2:45\
I remember sitting on the bus\
thinking of all the fun Ivan\
2:49\
and I would have together\
on this beautiful sunny day.\
2:53\
We would have breakfast,\
chat, play in the sand,\
2:57\
sunbathe--what a great\
time we were going to have!\
3:03\
As the bus arrived\
at the terminal,\
3:05\
I saw Ivan standing next\
to another young man,\
3:08\
both in white shirts and ties.\
3:11\
I got off the bus,\
we hugged each other,\
3:15\
and he introduced his companion.\
3:18\
Without wasting another\
minute, I told my brother\
3:21\
my plans for the\
day, but little did\
3:25\
I know what Ivan had scheduled.\
3:28\
He looked at me,\
smiled, and said, "Sure!\
3:32\
However, we need to\
do some errands first.\
3:35\
Would you come with us?"\
3:37\
I agreed, thinking that\
we would have enough time\
3:40\
to enjoy the beach afterward.\
3:44\
That day, for more\
than 10 hours,\
3:48\
I walked through the\
streets of that town\
3:53\
with my brother\
and his companion.\
3:55\
I smiled at people all\
day; I greeted people\
4:00\
I had never seen in my life.\
4:02\
We talked to everyone,\
knocked on the doors,\
4:06\
and visited people my\
brother and his companion\
4:10\
were teaching.\
4:12\
During one such visit, my\
brother and his companion\
4:15\
were teaching about Jesus Christ\
and the plan of salvation.\
4:19\
Suddenly, Ivan paused\
and looked at me.\
4:23\
To my surprise, he politely\
asked me to share my opinion\
4:29\
about what was being taught.\
4:31\
The room fell silent,\
and all eyes were on me.\
4:36\
With some difficulty, I\
finally found the words\
4:41\
and shared my feelings\
about the Savior.\
4:44\
I did not know if what I\
shared was right or wrong.\
4:50\
My brother never corrected\
me; to the contrary,\
4:57\
he thanked me for sharing\
my thoughts and feelings.\
5:01\
During those hours together,\
my brother and his companion\
5:05\
did not spend a single minute\
teaching a lesson exclusively\
5:09\
to me, yet I gained\
more knowledge\
5:13\
than in all my previous\
conversations with him.\
5:16\
I witnessed how countenances\
were changed as people received\
5:21\
spiritual light in their lives.\
5:23\
I saw how some of them\
found hope in the messages,\
5:28\
and I learned how to serve\
others and forget about myself\
5:33\
and my own desires.\
5:34\
I was doing what\
the Savior taught:\
5:37\
"If any man will come after\
me, let him deny himself."\
5:43\
Looking back, I realize\
that my faith grew that day\
5:47\
because my brother\
gave me the opportunity\
5:49\
to put it in action.\
5:51\
I exercised it as we\
read from the scriptures,\
5:56\
looked for people to teach,\
bore testimony, served others,\
6:01\
and so on.\
6:03\
We never got around to\
sunbathing that day,\
6:07\
but my heart was bathed\
in light from heaven.\
6:11\
I did not see even one small\
grain of sand at the beach,\
6:15\
but I felt my faith grow like\
a small grain of mustard seed.\
6:21\
I did not spend the\
sunny day as a tourist,\
6:25\
but I gained\
wonderful experiences,\
6:28\
and without realizing it, I\
was a missionary--without even\
6:32\
being a member of the Church!\
6:37\
Thanks to the Restoration\
of the gospel,\
6:40\
we can come to understand\
how our Heavenly Father helps\
6:44\
us develop spiritual gifts.\
6:47\
It is more likely\
that He will give us\
6:50\
opportunities to develop those\
gifts rather than just granting\
6:54\
them to us without spiritual\
and physical effort.\
6:58\
If we are in tune\
with His Spirit,\
7:01\
we will learn to identify\
those opportunities\
7:05\
and then act upon them.\
7:08\
If we seek more\
patience, we may find\
7:11\
ourselves needing to practice\
it while waiting for a response.\
7:15\
If we want to have more\
love for our neighbor,\
7:18\
we can foster it by sitting\
next to a new face at church.\
7:22\
With faith it is similar:\
when doubts come to our minds,\
7:27\
trusting in the\
Lord's promises will\
7:30\
be required to move forward.\
7:32\
In this way we are\
exercising spiritual muscles\
7:37\
and developing them into sources\
of strength in our lives.\
7:43\
It will probably not be\
easy at the beginning,\
7:46\
and it might even\
become a big challenge.\
7:50\
The words of the Lord,\
through the prophet Moroni,\
7:53\
apply to us today: "And\
if men come unto me I\
7:58\
will show unto them\
their weakness.\
8:01\
I give unto men weakness\
that they may be humble;\
8:06\
and my grace is sufficient for\
all men that humble themselves\
8:11\
before me; for if they\
humble themselves before me,\
8:15\
and have [or\
exercise] faith in me,\
8:20\
then will I make weak things\
become strong unto them."\
8:27\
I am grateful for\
my brother Ivan,\
8:29\
who not only shared\
the gospel with me\
8:32\
but also indirectly invited\
me to live it and recognize\
8:37\
my weaknesses.\
8:39\
He helped me to accept the\
invitation of the Master:\
8:42\
"Come, follow me"--to\
walk as the Savior walked,\
8:48\
seek as the Savior sought, and\
love as the Savior loves us.\
8:54\
Months later, after my\
missionary experience,\
9:01\
I decided to get baptized\
and to serve my own mission.\
9:06\
Let's accept the invitation\
of President Russell M. Nelson\
9:10\
and intently come\
unto the Savior\
9:12\
by identifying\
those muscles that\
9:14\
need more spiritual activity\
and starting to exercise them.\
9:20\
This is a long-distance, a\
marathon race rather than\
9:24\
a sprint, so do not forget\
those small but constant\
9:30\
spiritual activities\
that will strengthen\
9:34\
those important\
spiritual muscles.\
9:37\
If we want to\
increase our faith,\
9:40\
then let's do things\
that require faith.\
9:45\
I bear my witness that we are\
children of a loving Heavenly\
9:50\
Father.\
9:51\
His Son, Jesus Christ, loves us.\
9:56\
He came to this world\
to show us the way\
10:03\
and then gave His life\
voluntarily to give us hope.\
10:08\
The Savior invites us to\
follow His perfect example,\
10:13\
to exercise our faith in\
Him and His Atonement,\
10:19\
and to expand all\
the spiritual gifts\
10:22\
that we have been blessed with.\
10:25\
He is the way.\
10:27\
This is my testimony, in the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
