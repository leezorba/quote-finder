Approximately 18 months\
ago, in the fall of 2017,\
0:06\
my 64-year-old brother\
Mike informed me\
0:10\
that he had been diagnosed\
with pancreatic cancer.\
0:13\
He also told me that he had\
received a priesthood blessing\
0:16\
from his home teacher and that\
he had met with his bishop.\
0:20\
He later texted me a picture\
of the Oakland California\
0:23\
Temple taken from the hospital\
where he was receiving\
0:25\
treatment, with the\
caption "Look what I\
0:29\
can see from my hospital room."\
0:32\
I was as surprised\
by his comments\
0:34\
about home teachers, priesthood\
blessings, bishops, and temples\
0:38\
as I was about the cancer.\
0:40\
You see, Mike, a priest\
in the Aaronic Priesthood,\
0:43\
hadn't regularly attended\
church for close to 50 years.\
0:48\
As a family, we were\
almost as intrigued\
0:50\
with his spiritual progress\
as we were with his progress\
0:53\
in fighting the cancer,\
largely due to his now-frequent\
0:56\
questions about\
the Book of Mormon,\
0:58\
the sealing power,\
and life after death.\
1:01\
As the months passed\
and the cancer spread,\
1:05\
a need for additional and\
more specialized treatment\
1:07\
eventually brought Mike to Utah\
and the Huntsman Cancer Center.\
1:12\
Shortly after his\
arrival, Mike was\
1:14\
visited by John Holbrook,\
the ward mission\
1:16\
leader of the ward that\
served the care facility where\
1:19\
he was now living.\
1:20\
John commented that\
"it was obvious to me\
1:24\
that Mike was a son of\
God" and that they quickly\
1:27\
developed a bond\
and a friendship,\
1:29\
which led to John becoming\
Mike's de facto ministering\
1:32\
brother.\
1:33\
There was an\
immediate invitation\
1:36\
to have the missionaries visit,\
which my brother politely\
1:39\
declined.\
1:40\
But a month into\
their friendship,\
1:42\
John asked again,\
explaining to Mike,\
1:45\
"I think you'd enjoy\
hearing the gospel message."\
1:49\
This time the\
invitation was accepted,\
1:51\
leading to meetings\
with the missionaries\
1:53\
as well as visits with Bishop\
Jon Sharp, whose conversations\
1:57\
eventually led Mike to receiving\
his patriarchal blessing,\
2:01\
57 years after his baptism.\
2:05\
In early December of last year,\
following months of procedures,\
2:08\
Mike decided to stop the\
cancer treatments, which\
2:11\
were causing severe\
side effects,\
2:13\
and just to let nature\
take its course.\
2:16\
We were informed by his doctor\
that Mike had approximately\
2:19\
three months to live.\
2:20\
In the meantime,\
the gospel questions\
2:23\
continued, as did the\
visits and support\
2:26\
of his local priesthood leaders.\
2:27\
On our visits with Mike,\
we often saw an open copy\
2:30\
of the Book of Mormon\
on the bedstand\
2:32\
as we discussed the Restoration\
of the gospel, priesthood keys,\
2:36\
temple ordinances, and\
the eternal nature of man.\
2:40\
By mid-December, with his\
patriarchal blessing in hand,\
2:43\
Mike actually appeared\
to be gaining strength,\
2:45\
and his prognosis of at\
least another three months\
2:48\
seemed likely.\
2:49\
We even made plans for him\
to join us for Christmas,\
2:52\
for New Year's, and beyond.\
2:54\
On December 16, I received\
an unexpected call\
2:57\
from Bishop Sharp,\
who informed me\
2:59\
that he and the stake\
president had interviewed Mike,\
3:03\
had found him worthy to receive\
the Melchizedek Priesthood,\
3:06\
and asked when I would be\
available to participate.\
3:09\
The ordinance was scheduled\
for that Friday, December 21.\
3:12\
When the day arrived,\
my wife, Carol, and I\
3:16\
arrived at the care facility\
and were immediately met\
3:19\
in the hallway near\
his room and informed\
3:23\
that Mike had no pulse.\
3:25\
We entered the room to find\
the patriarch, his bishop,\
3:28\
and his stake president already\
waiting--and then Mike opened\
3:32\
his eyes.\
3:33\
He recognized me\
and acknowledged\
3:36\
that he could hear me\
and was ready to receive\
3:39\
the priesthood.\
3:40\
Fifty years after\
Mike had been ordained\
3:43\
a priest in the\
Aaronic Priesthood,\
3:45\
I had the privilege, assisted\
by his local leaders,\
3:48\
to confer the\
Melchizedek Priesthood\
3:51\
and ordain my brother\
to the office of elder.\
3:54\
Five hours later,\
Mike passed away,\
3:57\
crossing the veil to meet\
our parents as a holder\
4:00\
of the Melchizedek Priesthood.\
4:04\
Just one year ago, a call was\
extended by President Russell\
4:07\
M. Nelson for each of us to care\
for our brothers and sisters\
4:11\
in a "higher, holier way."\
4:13\
Speaking of the Savior,\
President Nelson\
4:15\
taught that "because it is\
His Church, we as His servants\
4:20\
will minister to the\
one, just as He did.\
4:23\
We will minister in His name,\
with His power and authority,\
4:28\
and with His loving-kindness".\
4:31\
In response to that invitation\
from a prophet of God,\
4:34\
remarkable efforts to\
minister to the one\
4:36\
are taking place\
all over the world,\
4:38\
in both coordinated efforts,\
as members faithfully\
4:42\
fulfill their\
ministering assignments,\
4:44\
as well as what I'll call\
"impromptu" ministering,\
4:47\
as so many demonstrate\
Christlike love in response\
4:50\
to unexpected opportunities.\
4:52\
In our own family, we\
witnessed, up close,\
4:55\
this type of ministering.\
4:58\
John, who was Mike's\
friend, ministering brother,\
5:01\
and a former mission president,\
used to tell his missionaries\
5:04\
that "if someone is\
on a list that says\
5:07\
'not interested,' don't give up.\
5:10\
People change."\
5:12\
He then told us, "Mike\
changed mightily."\
5:16\
John was first a\
friend, providing\
5:20\
frequent encouragement\
and support,\
5:22\
but his ministering didn't\
stop at friendly visits.\
5:25\
John knew that a minister\
is more than a friend\
5:28\
and that friendship is\
magnified as we minister.\
5:32\
It isn't necessary for\
someone to be suffering,\
5:35\
like my brother, from\
a life-threatening\
5:37\
disease in order to be in\
need of ministering service.\
5:40\
Those needs come in a variety of\
shapes, sizes, and conditions.\
5:44\
A single parent, a less-active\
couple, a struggling teen,\
5:49\
an overwhelmed mother, a trial\
of faith, financial, health,\
5:55\
or marriage issues--the\
list is almost endless.\
5:58\
However, like Mike, no\
one is too far gone,\
6:02\
and it's never too late for\
the Savior's loving reach.\
6:07\
We are taught on the ministering\
website of the Church\
6:10\
that "while there are many\
purposes of ministering,\
6:13\
our efforts should be\
guided by the desire\
6:16\
to help others achieve a\
deeper individual conversion\
6:20\
and become more\
like the Savior."\
6:22\
Elder Neil L. Andersen\
said it this way:\
6:26\
"A person with a good heart\
can help someone fix a tire,\
6:29\
take a roommate to\
the doctor, have\
6:32\
lunch with someone\
who is sad, or smile\
6:34\
and say hello to brighten a day.\
6:36\
"But a follower of\
the first commandment\
6:38\
will naturally add to these\
important acts of service."\
6:43\
In modeling our ministering\
after Jesus Christ,\
6:46\
it is important to\
remember that His efforts\
6:48\
to love, to lift,\
to serve and bless\
6:51\
had a higher goal than\
meeting the immediate need.\
6:55\
He clearly knew of\
their day-to-day needs\
6:58\
and had compassion on their\
current suffering as He healed,\
7:01\
fed, forgave, and taught.\
7:03\
But He wanted to do more\
than take care of today.\
7:07\
He wanted those around Him\
to follow Him, to know Him,\
7:11\
and to reach their\
divine potential.\
7:14\
As we seek to minister\
"just as He did,"\
7:16\
we will be provided\
opportunities\
7:18\
to forget self and lift others.\
7:20\
These opportunities may\
often be inconvenient\
7:23\
and test our desire\
to become more\
7:25\
like the Master,\
whose greatest service\
7:28\
of all, His infinite Atonement,\
was anything but convenient.\
7:32\
In Matthew chapter\
25, we are reminded\
7:35\
how the Lord feels about\
us when, like Him, we\
7:38\
are sensitive to the struggles,\
the trials and challenges faced\
7:42\
by so many but that can\
often be overlooked:\
7:46\
"Come, ye blessed of\
my Father, inherit\
7:49\
the kingdom prepared for\
you from the foundation\
7:51\
of the world:\
7:52\
"For I was an hungred, and ye\
gave me meat: I was thirsty,\
7:57\
and ye gave me drink:\
I was a stranger,\
7:59\
and ye took me in. ...\
8:01\
"Then shall the righteous answer\
him, saying, Lord, when saw we\
8:04\
thee an hungred, and\
fed thee? or thirsty,\
8:07\
and gave thee drink?\
8:09\
"When saw we thee a stranger,\
and took thee in? ...\
8:11\
"And the King shall\
answer and say unto them,\
8:13\
Verily I say unto\
you, Inasmuch as ye\
8:17\
have done it unto one of the\
least of these my brethren,\
8:19\
ye have done it unto me."\
8:23\
Whether we serve as ministering\
brothers or sisters,\
8:25\
or simply when we are made\
aware of someone in need,\
8:29\
we are encouraged to seek\
the guidance and direction\
8:31\
of the Spirit--and then act.\
8:33\
We may wonder how best to\
serve, but the Lord knows,\
8:37\
and through His Spirit we will\
be directed in our efforts.\
8:41\
Like Nephi, who "was\
led by the Spirit,\
8:44\
not knowing beforehand the\
things which [he] should do,"\
8:46\
we will also be\
led by the Spirit\
8:48\
as we strive to become\
instruments in the Lord's hands\
8:51\
to bless His children.\
8:53\
As we seek the guidance of\
the Spirit and trust the Lord,\
8:56\
we will be placed in situations\
and circumstances where we can\
9:00\
act and bless--in\
other words, minister.\
9:05\
There may be other times\
when we recognize a need\
9:07\
but we feel\
inadequate to respond,\
9:09\
assuming that what we have\
to offer is insufficient.\
9:12\
To do "just as He did," however,\
is to minister by giving what\
9:17\
we are capable of\
giving and to trust\
9:20\
that the Lord will\
magnify our efforts\
9:22\
to bless our "fellow travelers\
on this mortal journey."\
9:25\
For some, it may be giving the\
gift of time and their talents;\
9:29\
for others, it may be a\
kind word or a strong back.\
9:33\
And although we may feel that\
our efforts are inadequate,\
9:36\
President Dallin H. Oaks\
shared an important principle\
9:39\
regarding "small and simple."\
9:42\
He taught that small\
and simple acts\
9:44\
are powerful because they\
invite "the companionship\
9:47\
of the Holy Ghost," a companion\
that blesses both the giver\
9:51\
and the receiver.\
9:54\
Knowing that he would soon\
die, my brother Mike commented,\
9:58\
"It's amazing how\
pancreatic cancer\
10:00\
can make you focus on\
what's most important."\
10:03\
Thanks to wonderful\
men and women\
10:05\
who saw a need, who did\
not judge, and ministered\
10:08\
like the Savior, it\
wasn't too late for Mike.\
10:12\
For some, change may come\
sooner; for others, perhaps not\
10:16\
until they pass the veil.\
10:17\
However, we must remember\
that it is never too late\
10:21\
and no one has ever wandered\
so far from the path\
10:24\
that they are beyond the reach\
of the infinite Atonement\
10:27\
of Jesus Christ, which is\
limitless in its duration\
10:30\
and scope.\
10:32\
In last October's general\
conference, Elder Dale G.\
10:35\
Renlund taught that "no matter\
how long we have been off\
10:38\
the path ..., the moment\
we decide to change,\
10:41\
God helps us return."\
10:43\
That decision to\
change, however,\
10:45\
is often the result\
of an invitation, such\
10:48\
as "I think you'd enjoy\
hearing the gospel message."\
10:52\
Just as it is never too\
late for the Savior,\
10:55\
it is never too soon for\
us to extend an invitation.\
11:00\
This Easter season\
provides us, once again,\
11:03\
a wonderful opportunity to\
reflect on the great atoning\
11:06\
sacrifice of our Savior Jesus\
Christ and what He did for each\
11:10\
of us at such a tremendous\
cost--a cost that He Himself\
11:15\
declared "caused [Him],\
the greatest of all,\
11:19\
to tremble because of pain."\
11:21\
"Nevertheless," He\
states, "I partook\
11:24\
and finished my preparations\
unto the children of men."\
11:29\
I testify that,\
because He "finished,"\
11:32\
there is always hope.\
11:34\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
