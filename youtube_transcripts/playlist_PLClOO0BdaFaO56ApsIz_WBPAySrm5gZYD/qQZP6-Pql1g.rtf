I once saw a sign in a store\
window that said, "Happiness:\
0:06\
$15.00."\
0:07\
I was so curious to know\
how much happiness I\
0:11\
could buy for $15 that\
I went inside to see.\
0:16\
What I found was a lot of cheap\
trinkets and souvenirs--not one\
0:22\
thing I saw could possibly bring\
me the type of happiness that\
0:26\
the sign implied!\
0:28\
Over the years, I've thought\
many times about that sign\
0:31\
and how easy it can be to\
look for happiness in items\
0:37\
that are cheap or temporary.\
0:39\
As members of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
0:43\
Saints, we are blessed to know\
how and where true happiness is\
0:49\
found.\
0:50\
It is found in carefully\
living the gospel established\
0:54\
by our Lord and\
Savior, Jesus Christ,\
0:57\
and in striving to\
become more like Him.\
1:01\
We have a dear friend\
who was a train engineer.\
1:04\
One day while he was driving\
a train on his route,\
1:07\
he spotted a car stopped\
on the track ahead of him.\
1:11\
He quickly realized that the car\
was stuck and unable to cross\
1:16\
the track.\
1:17\
He immediately put the train\
in emergency mode, which\
1:21\
engaged the brakes\
on each box car that\
1:24\
extended three-quarters of\
a mile behind the engine,\
1:28\
carrying a load of 6,500 tons.\
1:33\
There was no physical chance\
that the train would be able\
1:37\
to stop before it hit\
the car--which it did.\
1:41\
Fortunately for the\
people in the car,\
1:44\
they heard the warning\
of the train whistle\
1:46\
and escaped from the\
car before the impact.\
1:49\
As the engineer spoke with the\
investigating police officer,\
1:54\
an angry woman approached them.\
1:57\
She shouted that she had\
seen the whole incident\
2:01\
and then testified that\
the engineer did not even\
2:05\
try to swerve out of\
the way to miss the car!\
2:13\
Obviously, if the engineer had\
been able to swerve and leave\
2:17\
the tracks to avoid an accident,\
he and his entire train\
2:22\
would have been lost\
in a derailment,\
2:25\
and the train's\
forward progress would\
2:27\
have come to an abrupt stop.\
2:30\
Fortunately for him,\
the rails of the tracks\
2:34\
on which his train\
ran kept the wheels\
2:36\
of the train snugly moving\
toward its destination\
2:40\
regardless of the\
obstacle in his way.\
2:43\
Fortunately for us, we too are\
on a track, a covenant path\
2:49\
we committed to when\
we were baptized\
2:51\
as members of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
2:54\
Saints.\
2:55\
Although we may encounter\
occasional obstacles\
2:59\
along the way,\
this path will keep\
3:02\
us moving toward our\
prized eternal destination\
3:06\
if we stay firmly on it.\
3:09\
The vision of the\
tree of life shows\
3:12\
how the effects of\
casualness can lead us away\
3:15\
from the covenant path.\
3:17\
Consider that the iron rod and\
the strait and narrow path,\
3:22\
or the covenant path, led\
directly to the tree of life,\
3:27\
where all the blessings\
provided by our Savior\
3:30\
and His Atonement are\
available to the faithful.\
3:33\
Also seen in the\
vision was a river\
3:36\
of water representing the\
filthiness of the world.\
3:40\
The scriptures describe\
that this river "ran along"\
3:45\
the path yet passed only\
"near" the tree, not to it.\
3:52\
The world is laden with\
distractions that can deceive\
3:57\
even the elect, causing\
them to be casual in living\
4:02\
their covenants--thus\
leading them near the tree,\
4:07\
but not to it.\
4:09\
If we are not careful in living\
our covenants with exactness,\
4:13\
our casual efforts\
may eventually\
4:17\
lead us into forbidden\
paths or to join\
4:20\
with those who have already\
entered the great and spacious\
4:22\
building.\
4:23\
If not careful, we may\
even drown in the depths\
4:29\
of a filthy river.\
4:32\
There is a careful way and a\
casual way to do everything,\
4:36\
including living the gospel.\
4:38\
As we consider our\
commitment to the Savior,\
4:43\
are we careful or casual?\
4:46\
Because of our mortal nature,\
don't we sometimes rationalize\
4:51\
our behavior, at times\
referring to our actions\
4:54\
as being in the gray, or\
mixing good with something\
4:58\
that's not so good?\
4:59\
Anytime we say "however,"\
"except," or "but"\
5:05\
when it applies to following the\
counsel of our prophet leaders\
5:10\
or living the gospel carefully,\
we are in fact saying,\
5:15\
"That counsel does\
not apply to me."\
5:18\
We can rationalize all\
we want, but the fact\
5:22\
is, there is not a right\
way to do the wrong thing!\
5:30\
The youth theme for 2019\
is taken from John 14:15,\
5:33\
where the Lord instructs, "If ye\
love me, keep my commandments."\
5:40\
If we love Him as\
we claim, can't we\
5:43\
show that love by being\
a little more careful\
5:46\
in living His commandments?\
5:49\
Being careful in\
living the gospel\
5:52\
does not necessarily mean\
being formal or stuffy.\
5:55\
What it does mean is being\
appropriate in our thoughts\
6:00\
and behavior as disciples\
of Jesus Christ.\
6:04\
As we ponder the difference\
between careful and casual\
6:08\
in our gospel living, here\
are some thoughts to consider:\
6:14\
Are we careful in our\
Sabbath-day worship\
6:16\
and in our preparation to\
partake of the sacrament\
6:20\
each week?\
6:21\
Could we be more careful in\
our prayers and scripture study\
6:24\
or be more actively\
engaged in Come,\
6:26\
Follow Me--For\
Individuals and Families?\
6:30\
Are we careful in\
our temple worship,\
6:32\
and do we carefully and\
deliberately live the covenants\
6:37\
we made both at baptism\
and at the temple?\
6:41\
Are we careful in our appearance\
and modest in our dress,\
6:47\
especially in sacred\
places and circumstances?\
6:52\
Are we careful in how we wear\
the sacred temple garments?\
6:57\
Or do the fashions of the world\
dictate a more casual attitude?\
7:03\
Are we careful in how we\
minister to others and in how\
7:05\
we fulfill our\
callings in the Church,\
7:08\
or are we indifferent or\
casual in our call to serve?\
7:13\
Are we careful or\
casual in what we read\
7:16\
and what we watch on TV\
and our mobile devices?\
7:21\
And are we careful\
in our language,\
7:23\
or do we casually embrace\
the crude and vulgar?\
7:29\
The For The Strength\
of Youth pamphlet\
7:31\
contains standards that,\
when followed carefully,\
7:34\
will bring rich\
blessings and help\
7:36\
us stay on the covenant path.\
7:38\
Although it was written for\
the benefit of the youth,\
7:42\
its standards do not expire\
when we leave the Young Men\
7:47\
and Young Women programs.\
7:48\
They apply to each\
of us all the time.\
7:53\
A review of these\
standards may prompt\
7:55\
other ways we can be more\
careful in our gospel living.\
7:59\
We do not lower our\
standards to fit in\
8:01\
or to make someone\
else feel comfortable.\
8:03\
We are disciples\
of Jesus Christ,\
8:07\
and as such, we are\
about elevating others,\
8:11\
lifting them to a higher,\
holier place where they too\
8:15\
can reap greater blessings.\
8:18\
I invite each of us to seek\
the guidance of the Holy Ghost\
8:23\
to know what adjustments we\
need to make in our lives\
8:26\
to be more carefully\
aligned with our covenants.\
8:29\
I also plead with you not\
to be critical of others\
8:33\
making this same journey.\
8:34\
"Judgment is mine,\
saith the Lord."\
8:37\
We are each in the process\
of growth and change.\
8:44\
The story told in\
the Book of Mormon\
8:46\
about the apostate Amlicites\
is interesting to me.\
8:51\
As a way of noting\
to others that they\
8:54\
were no longer associated with\
Jesus Christ and His Church,\
8:58\
they put a distinct mark of\
red on their foreheads for all\
9:01\
to see.\
9:02\
In an opposite way and as\
disciples of Jesus Christ,\
9:08\
how do we mark ourselves?\
9:11\
Can others easily see His\
image in our countenance\
9:16\
and know who we represent\
by the way we carefully\
9:19\
conduct our lives?\
9:22\
As a covenant people,\
we are not meant\
9:25\
to blend in with the\
rest of the world.\
9:27\
We have been called "a peculiar\
people"--what a compliment!\
9:35\
As the influences of the world\
increasingly embrace the evil,\
9:40\
we must strive\
with all diligence\
9:43\
to stay firmly on the path that\
leads us safely to the Savior,\
9:47\
widening the distance\
between our covenant living\
9:51\
and worldly influences.\
9:53\
As I reflect upon obtaining\
lasting happiness,\
9:56\
I realize that sometimes we\
do find ourselves in the gray.\
10:00\
Mists of darkness are\
inevitable as we journey\
10:04\
along the covenant path.\
10:05\
Temptation and casualness\
can cause us to subtly divert\
10:11\
our course into the\
darkness of the world\
10:14\
and away from the covenant path.\
10:16\
For the times when\
this might happen,\
10:19\
our beloved prophet,\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
10:23\
has urged us to get back\
on the covenant path\
10:26\
and to do so quickly.\
10:27\
How grateful I am for\
the gift of repentance\
10:31\
and for the power of\
the Savior's Atonement.\
10:36\
It's impossible to\
live a perfect life.\
10:39\
Only one man was able to\
live perfectly while dwelling\
10:43\
on this telestial planet.\
10:45\
That was Jesus Christ.\
10:48\
Although we may not be\
perfect, brothers and sisters,\
10:54\
we can be worthy: worthy to\
partake of the sacrament,\
10:59\
worthy of temple blessings,\
and worthy to receive\
11:04\
personal revelation.\
11:07\
King Benjamin testified of the\
happiness and the blessings\
11:11\
that come to those who\
carefully follow the Savior:\
11:16\
"And moreover, I would desire\
that ye should consider\
11:21\
on the blessed and happy\
state of those that\
11:25\
keep the commandments of God.\
11:26\
For behold, they are blessed\
in all things, both temporal\
11:32\
and spiritual; and if they\
hold out faithful to the end\
11:36\
they are received into\
heaven, that thereby they\
11:40\
may dwell with God in a state\
of never-ending happiness."\
11:47\
Can happiness be\
bought with $15?\
11:50\
No, it can't.\
11:53\
Deep and lasting happiness comes\
by intentionally and carefully\
12:00\
living the gospel\
of Jesus Christ.\
12:03\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
