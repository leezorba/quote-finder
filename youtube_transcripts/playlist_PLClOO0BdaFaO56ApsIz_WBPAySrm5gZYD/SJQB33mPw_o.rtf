My dear brethren, it is\
inspiring to look out\
0:05\
over this vast congregation\
of the Lord's battalion\
0:07\
of priesthood bearers.\
0:09\
What a mighty force\
for good you are!\
0:14\
We love you.\
0:16\
We pray for you.\
0:18\
And we are most\
grateful for you.\
0:23\
Recently I have found myself\
drawn to the Lord's instruction\
0:27\
given through the\
Prophet Joseph Smith:\
0:29\
"Say nothing but repentance\
unto this generation."\
0:36\
This declaration is often\
repeated throughout scripture.\
0:39\
It prompts an obvious question:\
"Does everyone need to repent?"\
0:46\
The answer is yes.\
0:51\
Too many people\
consider repentance\
0:54\
as punishment--something to\
be avoided except in the most\
1:00\
serious circumstances.\
1:03\
But this feeling\
of being penalized\
1:06\
is engendered by Satan.\
1:08\
He tries to block us from\
looking to Jesus Christ, who\
1:13\
stands with open arms,\
hoping and willing\
1:17\
to heal, forgive,\
cleanse, strengthen,\
1:23\
purify, and sanctify us.\
1:29\
The word for repentance\
in the Greek New Testament\
1:33\
is metanoeo.\
1:36\
The prefix meta- means "change."\
1:40\
The suffix -noeo is\
related to Greek words\
1:45\
that mean "mind," "knowledge,"\
"spirit," and "breath."\
1:53\
Thus, when Jesus asks\
you and me to "repent,"\
1:56\
He is inviting us to change\
our mind, our knowledge,\
2:03\
our spirit--even\
the way we breathe.\
2:08\
He is asking us to\
change the way we love,\
2:11\
think, serve, spend our\
time, treat our wives,\
2:16\
teach our children, and\
even care for our bodies.\
2:24\
Nothing is more\
liberating, more ennobling,\
2:28\
or more crucial to our\
individual progression\
2:31\
than is a regular, daily\
focus on repentance.\
2:38\
Repentance is not an\
event; it is a process.\
2:44\
It is the key to happiness\
and peace of mind.\
2:48\
When coupled with faith,\
repentance opens our access\
2:53\
to the power of the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
2:59\
Whether you are diligently\
moving along the covenant path,\
3:03\
have slipped or stepped\
from the covenant path,\
3:06\
or can't even see the path\
from where you are now,\
3:12\
I plead with you to repent.\
3:14\
Experience the strengthening\
power of daily repentance--of\
3:19\
doing and being a\
little better each day.\
3:27\
When we choose to repent,\
we choose to change!\
3:30\
We allow the Savior\
to transform us\
3:33\
into the best\
version of ourselves.\
3:39\
We choose to grow spiritually\
and receive joy--the joy\
3:43\
of redemption in Him.\
3:45\
When we choose to repent,\
we choose to become more\
3:49\
like Jesus Christ!\
3:53\
Brethren, we need to\
do better and be better\
3:57\
because we are in a battle.\
4:01\
The battle with sin is real.\
4:06\
The adversary is\
quadrupling his efforts\
4:10\
to disrupt testimonies and\
impede the work of the Lord.\
4:15\
He is arming his minions\
with potent weapons\
4:20\
to keep us from partaking of\
the joy and love of the Lord.\
4:26\
Repentance is the key to\
avoiding misery inflicted\
4:31\
by traps of the adversary.\
4:35\
The Lord does not expect\
perfection from us\
4:38\
at this point in our\
eternal progression.\
4:39\
But He does expect us to\
become increasingly pure.\
4:45\
Daily repentance is\
the pathway to purity,\
4:50\
and purity brings power.\
4:54\
Personal purity can\
make us powerful tools\
4:58\
in the hands of God.\
5:02\
Our repentance--our\
purity--will empower us to help\
5:08\
in the gathering of Israel.\
5:11\
The Lord taught the prophet\
Joseph Smith "that the rights\
5:15\
of the priesthood are\
inseparably connected with\
5:17\
the powers of heaven, and that\
the powers of heaven cannot be\
5:21\
controlled nor handled\
only upon the principles\
5:23\
of righteousness."\
5:27\
We know what will\
give us greater access\
5:30\
to the powers of heaven.\
5:32\
We also know what will hinder\
our progress--what we need\
5:38\
to stop doing to increase our\
access to the powers of heaven.\
5:44\
Brethren, prayerfully seek\
to understand what stands\
5:49\
in the way of your repentance.\
5:52\
Identify what stops\
you from repenting.\
5:56\
And then, change!\
5:59\
Repent!\
6:02\
All of us can do better and\
be better than ever before.\
6:10\
There are specific ways in\
which we can likely improve.\
6:14\
One is in the way\
we treat our bodies.\
6:18\
I stand in awe of the\
miracle of the human body.\
6:24\
It is a magnificent creation,\
essential to our gradual ascent\
6:31\
toward our ultimate\
divine potential.\
6:35\
We cannot progress without it.\
6:38\
In giving us the\
gift of a body, God\
6:42\
has allowed us to\
take a vital step\
6:45\
toward becoming more like Him.\
6:50\
Satan understands this.\
6:52\
He chafes at the fact that his\
premortal apostasy permanently\
6:58\
disqualifies him\
from this privilege,\
7:01\
leaving him in a constant state\
of jealousy and resentment.\
7:10\
Thus many, if not most, of the\
temptations he puts in our path\
7:15\
cause us to abuse our bodies\
or the bodies of others.\
7:23\
Because Satan is\
miserable without a body,\
7:27\
he wants us to be\
miserable because of ours.\
7:33\
Your body is your\
personal temple, created\
7:38\
to house your eternal spirit.\
7:40\
Your care of that\
temple is important.\
7:46\
Now, I ask you, brethren:\
Are you more interested\
7:50\
in dressing and grooming your\
body to appeal to the world\
7:54\
than you are to please God?\
7:57\
Your answer to this question\
sends a direct message to Him\
8:03\
about your feelings regarding\
His transcendent gift to you.\
8:10\
In this reverence for\
our bodies, brethren,\
8:12\
I think we can do\
better and be better.\
8:19\
Another way we can also\
do better and be better\
8:23\
is how we honor the\
women in our lives,\
8:27\
beginning with our\
wives and daughters,\
8:30\
our mothers and sisters.\
8:34\
Months ago, I received\
a heartbreaking letter\
8:38\
from a dear sister.\
8:40\
She wrote: "[My daughters and\
I] feel we are in [a] fierce\
8:47\
competition for our husbands'\
and sons' undivided attention,\
8:52\
with 24/7 sports updates, video\
games, stock market updates,\
9:02\
[and] endless analyzing and\
watching of games of every\
9:06\
[conceivable] sport.\
9:09\
It feels like we're\
losing our front-row seats\
9:13\
with our husbands\
and sons because\
9:16\
of their permanent front-row\
seats with [sports and games]."\
9:26\
Brethren, your first\
and foremost duty\
9:29\
as a bearer of the priesthood is\
to love and care for your wife.\
9:33\
Become one with her.\
9:36\
Be her partner.\
9:39\
Make it easy for her\
to want to be yours.\
9:43\
No other interest in\
life should take priority\
9:47\
over building an eternal\
relationship with her.\
9:50\
Nothing on TV, a mobile\
device, or a computer\
9:55\
is more important\
than her well-being.\
10:01\
Take an inventory of\
how you spend your time\
10:04\
and where you\
devote your energy.\
10:06\
That will tell you\
where your heart is.\
10:09\
Pray to have your heart\
attuned to your wife's heart.\
10:15\
Seek to bring her joy.\
10:18\
Seek her counsel and listen.\
10:23\
Her input will\
improve your output.\
10:26\
[LAUGHTER]\
10:34\
If you have need to\
repent because of the way\
10:36\
you have treated the women\
closest to you, begin now.\
10:40\
And remember that it\
is your responsibility\
10:44\
to help the women in your\
life receive the blessings\
10:49\
that derive from living\
the Lord's law of chastity.\
10:53\
Never be the reason that a woman\
is unable to receive her temple\
10:59\
blessings.\
11:02\
Brethren, we all need to repent.\
11:05\
We need to get up off the\
couch, put down the remote,\
11:09\
and wake up from our\
spiritual slumber.\
11:12\
It is time to put on\
the full armor of God\
11:16\
so we can engage in the most\
important work on earth.\
11:20\
It is time to "thrust\
in [our] sickles,\
11:23\
and reap with all [our]\
might, mind, and strength."\
11:27\
The forces of evil have\
never raged more forcefully\
11:31\
than they do today.\
11:33\
As servants of the Lord, we\
cannot be asleep while this\
11:38\
battle rages.\
11:40\
Your family needs your\
leadership and love.\
11:43\
Your quorum and those\
in your ward and branch\
11:47\
need your strength.\
11:48\
And all who meet\
you need to know\
11:51\
what a true disciple of the\
Lord looks like and acts like.\
11:57\
My dear brethren, you\
were chosen by our Father\
11:59\
to come to earth at this\
crucial time because\
12:03\
of your premortal\
spiritual valor.\
12:06\
You are among the finest,\
most valiant men who\
12:10\
have ever come to the earth.\
12:12\
Satan knows who you are and\
who you were premortally,\
12:19\
and he understands\
the work that must be\
12:21\
done before the Savior returns.\
12:24\
After millennia of\
practicing his cunning arts,\
12:29\
the adversary is experienced\
and incorrigible.\
12:35\
Gratefully, the\
priesthood we hold\
12:37\
is far stronger than are\
the wiles of the adversary.\
12:41\
I plead with you to be\
the men and young men\
12:44\
the Lord needs you to be.\
12:46\
Make your focus on\
daily repentance\
12:49\
so integral to\
your life that you\
12:52\
can exercise the priesthood with\
greater power than ever before.\
12:57\
This is the only way\
you will keep yourself\
13:00\
and your family spiritually safe\
in the challenging days ahead.\
13:07\
The Lord needs selfless men\
who put the welfare of others\
13:11\
ahead of their own.\
13:12\
He needs men who\
intentionally work\
13:15\
to hear the voice of\
the Spirit with clarity.\
13:18\
He needs men of the\
covenant who keep\
13:22\
their covenants with integrity.\
13:25\
He needs men who are determined\
to keep themselves sexually\
13:30\
pure--worthy men who\
can be called upon\
13:33\
at a moment's notice to give\
blessings with pure hearts,\
13:37\
clean minds, and willing hands.\
13:41\
The Lord needs men eager\
to repent--men with a zeal\
13:46\
to serve and be part of the\
Lord's battalion of worthy\
13:49\
priesthood bearers.\
13:54\
I bless you to become those men.\
13:57\
I bless you with the\
courage to repent daily\
14:01\
and learn how to exercise\
full priesthood power.\
14:05\
I bless you to communicate\
the love of the Savior\
14:09\
to your wife and children\
and to all who know you.\
14:14\
I bless you to do\
better and be better.\
14:20\
And I bless you that as\
you make these efforts,\
14:22\
you will experience\
miracles in your life.\
14:28\
We are engaged in the\
work of Almighty God.\
14:31\
Jesus is the Christ.\
14:34\
We are Their servants.\
14:36\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
