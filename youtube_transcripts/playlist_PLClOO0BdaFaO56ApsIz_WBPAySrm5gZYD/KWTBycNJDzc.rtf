My dear brothers\
and sisters, this\
0:04\
is a unique and pivotal\
time in history.\
0:07\
We are blessed to live\
in the last dispensation\
0:10\
before the Second\
Coming of the Savior.\
0:13\
Near the commencement of\
this dispensation in 1829,\
0:17\
the year before the Church\
was formally organized,\
0:20\
a beloved revelation\
was received\
0:23\
declaring that a\
"marvelous work" was\
0:26\
"about to come forth."\
0:27\
This revelation\
established that those\
0:30\
who desired to serve God\
qualify for such service\
0:34\
through "faith, hope,\
charity and love, with an eye\
0:39\
single to the glory of God."\
0:41\
Charity, which is "the\
pure love of Christ,"\
0:44\
includes God's eternal\
love for all His children.\
0:49\
My purpose this morning is to\
emphasize the essential role\
0:53\
of that kind of love in\
missionary work, temple\
0:57\
and family history work, and\
home-centered, Church-supported\
1:01\
family religious observance.\
1:04\
Love of the Savior and love\
of our fellow men and women\
1:07\
is the primary\
attribute and motive\
1:10\
for ministering and\
the spiritual purposes\
1:14\
we were charged to undertake by\
our beloved prophet, President\
1:19\
Russell M. Nelson, in the\
adjustments announced in 2018.\
1:24\
I was exposed to\
the relationship\
1:26\
between missionary work\
and love early in my life.\
1:29\
When I was 11 years old, I\
received a patriarchal blessing\
1:33\
from a patriarch who\
was also my grandfather.\
1:36\
That blessing said in part,\
"I bless you with great love\
1:41\
for your fellowmen, for thou\
shalt be called to carry\
1:45\
the gospel to the world ...\
to win souls unto Christ."\
1:50\
I understood even at that early\
age that sharing the gospel\
1:54\
was based on a great love\
for all our Heavenly Father's\
1:59\
children.\
2:01\
As General Authorities assigned\
to work on Preach My Gospel 15\
2:04\
years ago, we concluded\
that the attribute of love\
2:08\
was essential to\
missionary work in our day,\
2:11\
just as it has always been.\
2:14\
Chapter 6, on Christlike\
attributes, including charity\
2:18\
and love, has consistently\
been the most popular chapter\
2:23\
among missionaries.\
2:24\
As emissaries of the\
Savior, most missionaries\
2:30\
feel this kind of\
love, and when they do,\
2:34\
their efforts are blessed.\
2:36\
When members gain a vision\
of this kind of love, which\
2:39\
is essential in assisting\
the Lord in His purpose,\
2:43\
the Lord's work will\
be accomplished.\
2:47\
I was privileged to have a\
small role in a marvelous\
2:50\
example of this kind of love.\
2:52\
When I was serving as president\
of the Pacific Islands Area,\
2:56\
I received a call from\
President R. Wayne Shute.\
2:59\
As a young man, he served\
a mission in Samoa.\
3:03\
Later he returned to Samoa\
as a mission president.\
3:07\
When he telephoned me, he\
was the Apia Samoa Temple\
3:11\
president.\
3:12\
One of his young missionaries\
when he was mission president\
3:17\
was Elder O. Vincent\
Haleck, who is now the Area\
3:22\
President in the Pacific.\
3:24\
President Shute had\
great love and respect\
3:27\
for Vince and the\
entire Haleck family.\
3:31\
Most of the family were\
members of the Church,\
3:34\
but Vince's father, Otto\
Haleck, the patriarch\
3:38\
of the family (of German\
and Samoan descent),\
3:41\
was not a member.\
3:43\
President Shute knew I was\
attending a stake conference\
3:46\
and other meetings\
in American Samoa,\
3:49\
and he asked me if\
I would consider\
3:51\
staying in Otto\
Haleck's residence\
3:53\
with the view of sharing\
the gospel with him.\
3:57\
My wife, Mary, and I stayed\
with Otto and his wife,\
3:59\
Dorothy, in their\
beautiful home.\
4:01\
At breakfast I shared\
a gospel message\
4:04\
and invited Otto to meet\
with the missionaries.\
4:08\
He was kind but firm in\
refusing my invitation.\
4:12\
He said he was pleased that\
many members of his family\
4:15\
were Latter-day Saints,\
but he forcefully\
4:18\
indicated that some of his\
Samoan mother's ancestors\
4:23\
had been early Christian\
ministers in Samoa,\
4:26\
and he felt a great allegiance\
to their traditional Christian\
4:30\
faith.\
4:31\
Nevertheless, we\
left as good friends.\
4:36\
Later, when President\
Gordon B. Hinckley\
4:38\
was preparing to dedicate\
the Suva Fiji Temple,\
4:40\
he had his personal secretary,\
Brother Don H. Staheli,\
4:44\
call me in New Zealand\
to make arrangements.\
4:47\
President Hinckley wanted to\
fly from Fiji to American Samoa\
4:51\
to meet the Saints.\
4:52\
A certain hotel used in\
previous visits was suggested.\
4:57\
I asked if I could make\
different arrangements.\
5:00\
Brother Staheli said, "You\
are the Area President;\
5:02\
that would be fine."\
5:05\
I immediately called\
President Shute\
5:07\
and told him that perhaps\
we had a second chance\
5:11\
at spiritually blessing\
our friend Otto Haleck.\
5:15\
This time the missionary\
would be President Gordon B.\
5:18\
Hinckley.\
5:21\
I asked if he thought it would\
be appropriate for the Halecks\
5:24\
to host all of us in President\
Hinckley's travel group.\
5:27\
President and Sister\
Hinckley, their daughter Jane,\
5:30\
and Elder and Sister\
Jeffrey R. Holland\
5:32\
were also part of\
the travel group.\
5:35\
President Shute,\
working with the family,\
5:37\
made all the arrangements.\
5:40\
When we arrived from Fiji\
after the temple dedication,\
5:43\
we were warmly greeted.\
5:45\
We spoke that evening to\
thousands of Samoan members\
5:49\
and then proceeded to the\
Haleck family compound.\
5:52\
When we gathered for\
breakfast the next morning,\
5:55\
President Hinckley\
and Otto Haleck\
5:57\
had already become good friends.\
5:59\
It was interesting\
to me that they\
6:02\
were having much the\
same conversation\
6:04\
I had with Otto more\
than a year earlier.\
6:07\
When Otto expressed his\
admiration for our Church\
6:11\
but reaffirmed his commitment\
to his existing church,\
6:15\
President Hinckley put his\
hand on Otto's shoulder\
6:19\
and said, "Otto,\
that's not good enough;\
6:23\
you ought to be a\
member of the Church.\
6:25\
This is the Lord's Church."\
6:28\
You figuratively could see\
the resistive armor fall\
6:32\
away from Otto with\
an openness to what\
6:35\
President Hinckley said.\
6:37\
This was the beginning of\
additional missionary teaching\
6:40\
and a spiritual\
humility that allowed\
6:43\
Otto Haleck to be baptized and\
confirmed a little over a year\
6:47\
later.\
6:48\
One year after that,\
the Haleck family\
6:50\
was sealed as an eternal\
family in the temple.\
6:55\
What touched my heart throughout\
this incredible experience\
7:00\
was the overwhelming\
ministering love\
7:03\
exhibited by\
President Wayne Shute\
7:06\
for his former missionary\
Elder Vince Haleck\
7:09\
and his desire to see the\
entire Haleck family united\
7:14\
as an eternal family.\
7:16\
When it comes to\
gathering Israel,\
7:19\
we need to align our hearts\
with this kind of love\
7:23\
and move away from feelings of\
mere responsibility or guilt\
7:29\
to feelings of love\
and participation\
7:32\
in the divine partnership of\
sharing the Savior's message,\
7:36\
ministry, and mission\
with the world.\
7:40\
As members we can show\
our love for the Savior\
7:43\
and our brothers and\
sisters throughout the world\
7:45\
by making simple invitations.\
7:47\
The new Sunday meeting\
schedule represents\
7:50\
an exceptional\
opportunity for members\
7:54\
to successfully\
and lovingly invite\
7:56\
friends and associates to\
come and see and feel a Church\
8:02\
experience.\
8:03\
A spiritual sacrament\
meeting, hopefully\
8:06\
as sacred as Elder Holland\
described yesterday,\
8:10\
will be followed by a 50-minute\
meeting focused on the New\
8:13\
Testament and the Savior\
or relevant conference\
8:17\
addresses also focused on\
the Savior and His doctrine.\
8:22\
Some Relief Society\
sisters have wondered\
8:24\
why they have been given a\
"gathering" assignment along\
8:28\
with priesthood quorum members.\
8:29\
There are reasons for\
this, and President Nelson\
8:32\
set forth many of them in\
the last general conference.\
8:36\
He concluded, "We simply cannot\
gather Israel without you."\
8:41\
In our day we are blessed\
that approximately 30 percent\
8:44\
of our full-time\
missionaries are sisters.\
8:47\
This provides\
additional incentive\
8:49\
for Relief Society sisters\
to lovingly share the gospel.\
8:53\
What is needed is a\
loving, compassionate,\
8:57\
spiritual commitment by each\
of us--men, women, youth,\
9:01\
and children--to share the\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
9:05\
If we show love,\
kindness, and humility,\
9:08\
many will accept our invitation.\
9:12\
Those who choose not to\
accept our invitation\
9:15\
will still be our friends.\
9:17\
Love is also at the center of\
our temple and family history\
9:21\
effort to gather Israel on\
the other side of the veil.\
9:24\
When we learn of the trials and\
hardships our ancestors faced,\
9:29\
our love and appreciation\
for them is magnified.\
9:32\
Our temple and\
family history effort\
9:35\
has been strengthened\
to a significant degree\
9:38\
by the new adjustments in\
both the Sunday meeting\
9:40\
schedule and the\
youth advancement\
9:43\
in classes and quorums.\
9:45\
These changes provide for\
earlier and more powerful\
9:49\
attention to learning\
about our ancestors\
9:52\
and gathering Israel on\
the other side of the veil.\
9:55\
Both temple and family history\
work are greatly enhanced.\
9:59\
The internet is a\
powerful tool; the home\
10:02\
is now our primary\
family history center.\
10:05\
Our young members are\
exceptionally skilled in family\
10:09\
history research\
and are spiritually\
10:12\
motivated to perform baptisms\
for their ancestors, who\
10:16\
they have learned to\
love and appreciate.\
10:18\
Since the change allowing\
many 11-year-olds\
10:21\
to perform baptisms\
for the dead,\
10:24\
temple presidents\
across the world report\
10:27\
greatly increased attendance.\
10:30\
One temple president informs\
us that "there has been\
10:34\
a remarkable increase\
in baptismal patrons ...\
10:38\
and the addition of 11-year-olds\
brings more families...\
10:42\
.\
10:43\
Even at their [young]\
age, they appear\
10:45\
to sense reverence and\
purpose for the ordinance\
10:48\
they are performing.\
10:49\
It is beautiful to watch!"\
10:52\
I know our Primary\
and youth leaders\
10:54\
are and will continue to make\
family history and temple work\
10:58\
a major effort.\
10:59\
Relief Society sisters\
and priesthood brethren\
11:02\
can lovingly help fulfill\
their temple and family history\
11:06\
responsibility individually and\
also by assisting and inspiring\
11:11\
children and youth\
to gather Israel\
11:14\
on the other side of the veil.\
11:15\
This is particularly important\
in the home and on the Sabbath.\
11:20\
I promise that lovingly\
performing ordinances\
11:23\
for ancestors will\
strengthen and protect\
11:26\
our youth and families\
in a world that\
11:28\
is becoming increasingly evil.\
11:31\
I also personally testify that\
President Russell M. Nelson\
11:37\
has received profoundly\
important revelations relating\
11:42\
to temples and temple work.\
11:46\
The new emphasis on\
home-centered gospel study\
11:49\
and living and the resources\
that are provided by the Church\
11:52\
are a great opportunity\
for lovingly\
11:55\
preparing eternal families and\
individuals to meet and live\
11:59\
with God.\
12:00\
When a man and woman are\
sealed in the temple,\
12:02\
they enter the holy\
order of matrimony\
12:05\
in the new and\
everlasting covenant,\
12:07\
an order of the priesthood.\
12:09\
Together they obtain and receive\
priesthood blessings and power\
12:14\
to direct the affairs\
of their family.\
12:17\
Women and men have\
unique roles as\
12:19\
outlined in "The Family: A\
Proclamation to the World,"\
12:23\
but their stewardships are\
equal in value and importance.\
12:27\
They have equal power to receive\
revelation for their family.\
12:31\
When they work together\
in love and righteousness,\
12:35\
their decisions\
are heaven blessed.\
12:39\
Those who seek to know\
the will of the Lord\
12:41\
as individuals and\
for their families\
12:43\
must strive for righteousness,\
meekness, kindness, and love.\
12:48\
Humility and love\
are the hallmark\
12:52\
of those who seek the\
Lord's will, especially\
12:55\
for their families.\
12:57\
Perfecting ourselves,\
qualifying ourselves\
13:00\
for the blessings of covenants,\
and preparing to meet God\
13:04\
are individual responsibilities.\
13:06\
We need to be\
self-reliant and anxiously\
13:10\
engaged in making\
our homes a refuge\
13:14\
from the storms that surround\
us and a sanctuary of faith.\
13:19\
Parents have a responsibility to\
lovingly teach their children.\
13:23\
Homes filled with love\
are a joy, a delight,\
13:26\
and a literal heaven on earth.\
13:28\
My mother's favorite\
hymn was "Love at Home."\
13:30\
Whenever she heard\
the first phrase,\
13:32\
"There is beauty all around\
when there's love at home,"\
13:35\
she became visibly\
touched and teary.\
13:38\
As children we were aware that\
we lived in that kind of home;\
13:42\
it was one of her\
highest priorities.\
13:46\
In addition to a loving\
atmosphere in the home,\
13:48\
President Nelson has focused\
on limiting media use that\
13:52\
disrupts our primary purposes.\
13:55\
One adjustment that will\
benefit almost any family\
13:58\
is to make the internet, social\
media, and television a servant\
14:02\
instead of a distraction\
or, even worse, a master.\
14:06\
The war for the souls of all,\
but particularly children,\
14:10\
is often in the home.\
14:12\
As parents, we need to make\
sure that media content is\
14:15\
both wholesome, age appropriate,\
and consistent with the loving\
14:20\
atmosphere we are\
trying to create.\
14:23\
Teaching in our\
homes needs to be\
14:25\
clear and compelling but\
also spiritual, joyful,\
14:29\
and full of love.\
14:31\
I promise that as we focus\
on our love for the Savior\
14:35\
and His Atonement, make Him\
the centerpiece of our efforts\
14:39\
to gather Israel on both\
sides of the veil, minister\
14:42\
to others, and individually\
prepare to meet God,\
14:45\
the influence of the\
adversary will be diminished\
14:49\
and the joy, delight,\
and peace of the gospel\
14:52\
will magnify our homes\
with Christlike love.\
14:56\
I testify of these\
doctrinal promises and bear\
15:00\
witness of Jesus Christ\
and His atoning sacrifice\
15:04\
in our behalf.\
15:05\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
