As Jesus walked in a\
street near Capernaum\
0:05\
with a great crowd\
of people around Him,\
0:08\
a woman afflicted with a\
serious condition for 12 years\
0:12\
reached out and touched\
the hem of His garment.\
0:15\
Immediately she was healed.\
0:18\
The scriptures\
record that Jesus,\
0:20\
perceiving "that [power\
had] gone out of [Him],"\
0:23\
"turned him about in the\
press" and "looked ...\
0:26\
to see her that had\
done this thing."\
0:28\
"When the woman saw\
that she was not hid,"\
0:31\
she "fell down before him,\
and told him all the truth."\
0:36\
Jesus said unto her,\
"Daughter, be of good comfort:\
0:40\
thy faith hath made thee\
whole; go in peace."\
0:46\
Jesus Christ saved the woman.\
0:48\
She was healed physically, but\
when Jesus turned to see her,\
0:52\
she declared her faith in\
Him, and He healed her heart.\
0:57\
He spoke to her with love,\
assured her of His approval,\
1:01\
and blessed her with His peace.\
1:05\
Brethren, as bearers\
of the holy priesthood,\
1:08\
we are engaged in the\
work of salvation.\
1:11\
In the last year the Lord\
has placed the leadership\
1:14\
of this work squarely on\
the shoulders of the elders\
1:18\
in Israel.\
1:19\
We have an inspiring charge\
from the Lord--working with\
1:23\
our sisters, we are to\
minister in a holier way,\
1:27\
accelerate the gathering\
of Israel on both sides\
1:30\
of the veil, establish our\
homes as sanctuaries of faith\
1:34\
and gospel learning, and prepare\
the world for the Second Coming\
1:38\
of Jesus Christ.\
1:40\
As in all things, the\
Savior has shown us the way:\
1:44\
we need to look to and serve\
Jesus Christ as He looked to\
1:50\
and served His Father.\
1:52\
The Savior said it this\
way to the Prophet Joseph:\
1:56\
"Look unto me in every\
thought; doubt not, fear not.\
2:02\
"Behold the wounds which\
pierced my side, and also\
2:05\
the prints of the nails\
in my hands and feet;\
2:08\
be faithful, keep my\
commandments, and ye\
2:12\
shall inherit the\
kingdom of heaven."\
2:14\
In the premortal realm,\
Jesus promised His Father\
2:18\
that He would do\
His Father's will\
2:20\
and be our Savior and Redeemer.\
2:22\
When His Father asked,\
"Whom shall I send?"\
2:25\
Jesus answered,\
"Here am I, send me."\
2:29\
"Father, thy will be done, and\
the glory be thine forever."\
2:34\
All through His mortal life,\
Jesus lived that promise.\
2:38\
In humility, meekness, and love,\
He taught His Father's doctrine\
2:43\
and did His Father's work\
with the power and authority\
2:46\
His Father had given Him.\
2:48\
Jesus gave His\
heart to His Father.\
2:51\
He said:\
2:53\
"I love the Father."\
2:55\
"I do always those\
things that please him."\
2:58\
"I came ... not to\
do mine own will,\
3:00\
but the will of [the\
Father who] sent me."\
3:03\
In His agony in Gethsemane,\
He prayed, "Nevertheless\
3:07\
not my will, but\
thine, be done."\
3:10\
When the Lord calls\
the elders in Israel\
3:13\
to "look unto me\
in every thought"\
3:16\
and "behold the wounds"\
in His resurrected body,\
3:19\
it is a call to turn away\
from sin and the world\
3:23\
and to turn to Him\
and love and obey Him.\
3:26\
It is a call to\
teach His doctrine\
3:29\
and do His work in His way.\
3:32\
It is, therefore, a call to\
trust Him completely, surrender\
3:37\
our will and yield\
our hearts to Him,\
3:40\
and, through His redeeming\
power, become like Him.\
3:44\
Brethren, if we look\
unto Jesus Christ,\
3:48\
He will bless us to be His\
elders in Israel--humble, meek,\
3:56\
submissive, full of His love.\
3:59\
And we will bring\
the joy and blessings\
4:02\
of His gospel and His Church to\
our families and our brothers\
4:05\
and sisters on both\
sides of the veil.\
4:08\
President Russell\
M. Nelson has called\
4:09\
us to look unto Jesus\
Christ in just this way:\
4:13\
"There is nothing easy or\
automatic about becoming\
4:17\
such powerful disciples.\
4:18\
Our focus must be riveted on\
the Savior and His gospel.\
4:22\
It is mentally\
rigorous to strive\
4:25\
to look unto Him\
in every thought.\
4:27\
But when we do, our\
doubts and fears flee."\
4:32\
Rivet is a great word.\
4:35\
It means to fasten firmly, to\
attract and hold completely.\
4:41\
We rivet our focus on\
Jesus Christ and His gospel\
4:45\
by living our covenants.\
4:48\
When we live our\
covenants, they influence\
4:51\
everything we say and do.\
4:53\
We live a covenant life full of\
simple, everyday acts of faith\
4:59\
that focus us on\
Jesus Christ: prayer\
5:03\
from the heart in His\
name, feasting on His word,\
5:07\
turning to Him to repent of our\
sins, keeping His commandments,\
5:12\
partaking of the sacrament\
and keeping His Sabbath holy,\
5:16\
worshipping in His Holy\
temple as often as we can,\
5:20\
and exercising His\
holy priesthood\
5:23\
to serve God's children.\
5:25\
These acts of covenant devotion\
open our hearts and minds\
5:30\
to the redeeming\
power of the Savior\
5:33\
and the sanctifying\
influence of the Holy Ghost.\
5:36\
Line upon line, the Savior\
changes our very nature;\
5:41\
we become more deeply\
converted unto Him,\
5:44\
and our covenants come\
alive in our hearts.\
5:48\
The promises we make\
to our Heavenly Father\
5:51\
become rock-solid commitments,\
our deepest desires.\
5:56\
Heavenly Father's promises to us\
fill us with gratitude and joy.\
6:00\
Our covenants cease to be\
rules we follow and become\
6:06\
beloved principles that\
inspire and guide us\
6:10\
and rivet our focus\
on Jesus Christ.\
6:15\
These acts of devotion\
are available to all,\
6:17\
young and old.\
6:19\
You young men who hold the\
holy Aaronic Priesthood,\
6:22\
everything I have said\
tonight applies to you.\
6:24\
I thank God for you.\
6:27\
You make sacred\
ordinances and covenants\
6:31\
available to millions of\
Latter-day Saints every week.\
6:35\
When you prepare, bless, or\
pass the sacrament; minister;\
6:41\
baptize in the temple; invite\
a friend to an activity;\
6:45\
or rescue a member\
of your quorum,\
6:47\
you are doing the\
work of salvation.\
6:49\
You too can look\
unto Jesus Christ\
6:53\
and live your\
covenants every day.\
6:56\
I promise you that\
if you do, you\
6:59\
will be trusted\
servants of the Lord now\
7:02\
and, in a coming day,\
mighty elders in Israel.\
7:07\
Brethren, I know that all\
of this may sound daunting.\
7:11\
But please remember these\
words of the Savior:\
7:15\
"I am not alone, because\
the Father is with me."\
7:21\
So it is with us.\
7:23\
We are not alone.\
7:25\
The Lord Jesus Christ and\
our Heavenly Father love us,\
7:29\
and They are with us.\
7:31\
Because Jesus\
looked to His Father\
7:33\
and completed the great\
atoning sacrifice,\
7:36\
we can look to Jesus Christ with\
assurance that He will help us.\
7:42\
None of us are perfect.\
7:44\
Sometimes we get stuck.\
7:47\
We get distracted\
or discouraged.\
7:50\
We stumble.\
7:51\
But if we look to Jesus\
Christ with a repentant heart,\
7:57\
He will lift us up,\
cleanse us from sin,\
8:01\
forgive us, and heal our hearts.\
8:05\
He is patient and kind;\
His redeeming love never\
8:11\
ends and never fails.\
8:15\
He will help us\
live our covenants\
8:18\
and magnify our calling\
as elders in Israel.\
8:22\
And the Father will bless\
us with all things required\
8:27\
to accomplish His\
purposes: "things ...\
8:30\
both in heaven and on the\
earth, the life and the light,\
8:34\
the Spirit and the power, sent\
forth by the will of the Father\
8:39\
through Jesus Christ, his Son."\
8:42\
When divine light and\
power flow into our lives,\
8:46\
three miraculous things happen:\
8:49\
First, we can see!\
8:51\
Through revelation\
we begin to see\
8:53\
as Jesus saw the woman: beyond\
the surface into the heart.\
8:58\
As we see as Jesus\
sees, He blesses\
9:01\
us to love those we\
serve with His love.\
9:05\
With His help, those we\
serve will see the Savior\
9:08\
and feel His love.\
9:10\
Second, we have\
priesthood power!\
9:14\
We have the authority\
and the power\
9:16\
to act in the name\
of Jesus Christ\
9:18\
"to bless, guide, protect,\
strengthen, and heal\
9:23\
others" and bring\
miracles to those we love\
9:25\
and keep our marriages\
and families safe.\
9:28\
Third, Jesus Christ\
goes with us!\
9:33\
Where we go, He goes.\
9:36\
When we teach, He teaches.\
9:39\
When we comfort, He comforts.\
9:43\
When we bless, He blesses.\
9:47\
Brethren, have we\
not cause to rejoice?\
9:51\
We do!\
9:52\
We hold the holy\
priesthood of God.\
9:56\
As we look unto Jesus\
Christ, live our covenants,\
9:59\
and rivet our focus\
on Him, we will\
10:03\
join with our sisters and\
minister in a holier way,\
10:07\
gather scattered Israel\
on both sides of the veil,\
10:10\
strengthen and\
seal our families,\
10:13\
and prepare the world for the\
Second Coming of the Lord Jesus\
10:17\
Christ.\
10:17\
It will happen.\
10:20\
I so testify.\
10:22\
I close with this prayer\
from my heart that all of us,\
10:27\
every one, will look unto\
Jesus Christ in every thought.\
10:32\
Doubt not.\
10:33\
Fear not.\
10:36\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
