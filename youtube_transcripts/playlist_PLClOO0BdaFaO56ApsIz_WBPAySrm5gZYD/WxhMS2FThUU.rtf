Dear brothers and\
sisters, the Lord\
0:03\
has repeatedly told us to\
"seek learning, even by study\
0:07\
and also by faith."\
0:09\
We can receive light\
and understanding\
0:12\
not only through the logical\
reasoning of our minds,\
0:16\
but also through the\
guidance and inspiration\
0:19\
of the Holy Ghost.\
0:21\
This additional\
source of knowledge\
0:23\
has not always been\
part of my life.\
0:27\
My dear wife, Irene, and I\
joined the Church 31 years ago\
0:32\
when we were newly married.\
0:34\
We had both grown\
up in Colombia,\
0:37\
but a few months\
after our marriage,\
0:39\
my career took us\
to live in Germany.\
0:42\
We were very young and had\
great hopes and expectations;\
0:46\
it was an especially exciting\
and happy time for us.\
0:52\
While I was concentrated\
on my career,\
0:54\
Irene was feeling that we would\
receive some kind of message\
0:59\
from heaven, without\
knowing how or when.\
1:02\
So she started\
letting into our home\
1:06\
all kinds of door-to-door\
salespeople with encyclopedias,\
1:10\
vacuum cleaners, cookbooks,\
kitchen appliances, and so on,\
1:14\
always waiting for\
that unique message.\
1:19\
One evening she told me that\
two young men in dark suits\
1:23\
had knocked on our\
door and that she\
1:26\
had felt a very clear and\
distinct impression to let them\
1:29\
in.\
1:30\
They had said that they wanted\
to talk to her about God\
1:33\
but would come back again\
when I was also at home.\
1:37\
Could this be the\
expected message?\
1:42\
They began to visit us,\
and with their guidance,\
1:45\
we read in the\
scriptures and came\
1:47\
to understand the crucial\
importance of Jesus Christ\
1:50\
as our Savior and Redeemer.\
1:52\
We soon regretted\
that we had been\
1:56\
baptized as little\
babies, which had not\
1:58\
been a conscious covenant.\
2:00\
However, being baptized\
again would also\
2:04\
mean becoming members\
of this new Church,\
2:07\
so first we really needed to\
understand everything about it.\
2:13\
But how could we know if what\
the missionaries were telling\
2:16\
us about the Book of\
Mormon, about Joseph Smith,\
2:19\
and about the plan of salvation\
was actually all true?\
2:24\
Well, we had understood\
from the words of the Lord\
2:27\
that we could "know\
them by their fruits."\
2:30\
So, in a very\
systematic manner, we\
2:34\
started examining the Church\
by looking for those fruits\
2:38\
with the eyes of our\
very rational minds.\
2:41\
What did we see?\
2:43\
Well, we saw:\
2:45\
Friendly and happy people\
and wonderful families\
2:48\
who understood that we are\
meant to feel joy in this life\
2:52\
and not just\
suffering and misery.\
2:55\
A church that does not\
have a paid clergy but one\
2:59\
in which members themselves\
accept assignments\
3:02\
and responsibilities.\
3:04\
A church where Jesus\
Christ and families\
3:07\
are at the center of everything,\
where members fast once a month\
3:11\
and donate to help\
the poor and needy,\
3:14\
where healthy\
habits are promoted,\
3:16\
teaching us to abstain\
from harmful substances.\
3:20\
IN ADDITION: We liked the\
emphasis on personal growth,\
3:23\
on education, on hard\
work and self-reliance.\
3:28\
We learned about the remarkable\
humanitarian program.\
3:31\
And we were impressed by\
the general conferences,\
3:34\
with the wonderful music and\
profound spiritual principles\
3:38\
shared there.\
3:40\
Seeing all this, we could\
find no fault in the Church.\
3:43\
On the contrary, we liked\
everything we saw very much.\
3:47\
However, we still\
could not decide\
3:50\
to be baptized because we\
wanted to know everything\
3:53\
before doing so.\
3:55\
But even in our indecision,\
the Lord was patiently\
3:59\
preparing us, He was\
molding us, and He\
4:02\
was helping us to discover\
that we should learn\
4:05\
to discern the truth not only\
through our rational minds\
4:10\
but also through the very still\
and small voice of the Spirit,\
4:14\
which speaks especially\
to our hearts.\
4:18\
That voice and the resulting\
feeling came one evening after\
4:21\
10 months of\
learning the gospel,\
4:23\
when we read in Mosiah 18:\
"As ye are desirous to ...\
4:28\
bear one another's burdens, ...\
and comfort those that stand\
4:32\
in need of comfort, ... if this\
be the desire of your hearts,\
4:36\
what have you against\
being baptized in the name\
4:39\
of the Lord?"\
4:42\
That passage from\
the Book of Mormon\
4:43\
entered our hearts and\
souls, and we suddenly\
4:46\
felt and knew that\
there was really\
4:48\
no reason not to be baptized.\
4:51\
We realized that the desires\
mentioned in these verses\
4:54\
were also the\
wishes of our hearts\
4:57\
and that those things\
were what really mattered.\
5:01\
They were more important than\
understanding everything,\
5:04\
because we already knew enough.\
5:06\
We had always relied on the\
guiding hand of a loving\
5:09\
Heavenly Father and\
were confident that He\
5:12\
would continue to guide us.\
5:15\
So that same day, we set\
up a date for our baptism,\
5:18\
and soon we were\
baptized, finally!\
5:22\
What did we learn\
from that experience?\
5:25\
First, we learned\
that we can fully\
5:27\
trust in a loving Heavenly\
Father, who is constantly\
5:31\
trying to help us become the\
person He knows we can become.\
5:35\
We confirmed the profound truth\
of His words when He said:\
5:40\
"I will give unto the children\
of men line upon line,\
5:44\
precept upon precept, here\
a little and there a little;\
5:47\
and blessed are those who\
hearken unto my precepts, ...\
5:51\
for they shall learn wisdom; for\
unto him that receiveth I will\
5:56\
give more."\
5:58\
And second, we learned that in\
addition to our rational minds,\
6:02\
another dimension\
to gaining knowledge\
6:04\
can give us guidance\
and understanding.\
6:06\
It is the still and soft\
voice of His Holy Spirit\
6:10\
speaking to our hearts\
and also to our minds.\
6:14\
I like to compare this principle\
with our visual capacity.\
6:18\
Our Father in Heaven has\
given us not only one,\
6:23\
but two physical eyes.\
6:25\
We can see adequately\
with only one eye,\
6:28\
but the second eye provides\
us with another perspective.\
6:32\
When both perspectives are\
put together in our brains,\
6:35\
they produce a three-dimensional\
image of our surroundings.\
6:40\
Likewise, we have been given\
two sources of information\
6:43\
through our physical and\
spiritual capacities.\
6:46\
Our mind produces one perception\
through our physical senses\
6:50\
and through our reasoning.\
6:52\
But through the gift\
of the Holy Ghost,\
6:54\
the Father has also provided\
us with a second perspective,\
6:58\
which is really the most\
important and true one\
7:01\
because it comes\
directly from Him.\
7:03\
But since the whisperings of\
the Spirit are often so subtle,\
7:08\
many people are not\
consciously aware\
7:10\
of that additional source.\
7:13\
When these two perspectives\
are then combined in our souls,\
7:16\
one complete picture shows\
the reality of things\
7:20\
as they truly are.\
7:21\
In fact, through the additional\
perspective of the Holy Ghost,\
7:26\
certain "realities,"\
as pictured exclusively\
7:29\
through our mental\
understanding,\
7:31\
can be exposed as\
deceiving or plainly wrong.\
7:34\
Remember the words of Moroni:\
"By the power of the Holy Ghost\
7:39\
ye may know the\
truth of all things."\
7:43\
In my 31 years as a\
member of the Church,\
7:47\
I have experienced many\
times that if we rely only\
7:50\
on our rational mind\
and deny or neglect\
7:54\
the spiritual understanding\
we can receive\
7:56\
through the whisperings and\
impressions of the Holy Ghost,\
7:59\
it is as if we were going\
through life with only one eye.\
8:03\
But figuratively\
speaking, we have actually\
8:07\
been given two eyes.\
8:09\
Only the combination\
of both views\
8:12\
can give us the true and\
complete picture of all truths\
8:16\
and of everything we\
experience in our lives,\
8:19\
as well as of the whole\
and profound understanding\
8:22\
of our identity and purpose as\
children of a living Heavenly\
8:27\
Father.\
8:29\
I am reminded of what President\
Nelson taught us a year ago\
8:32\
when he said that\
"in coming days,\
8:36\
it will not be possible\
to survive spiritually\
8:39\
without the guiding,\
directing, comforting,\
8:41\
and constant influence\
of the Holy Ghost."\
8:46\
I have come to know with\
absolute certainty that:\
8:49\
We have a loving\
Father in Heaven,\
8:52\
and we all agreed to come\
to this earth as part\
8:55\
of a divine plan.\
8:57\
That Jesus is the\
Christ; He lives\
8:59\
and is my Savior and Redeemer.\
9:02\
I know that Joseph, a\
humble farm boy, was called\
9:06\
and became the\
mighty prophet who\
9:08\
initiated this, the dispensation\
of the fulness of times,\
9:12\
with all of its keys,\
power, and authority\
9:15\
of the holy priesthood.\
9:18\
I know that the Book of Mormon\
is a second witness of Jesus\
9:22\
Christ and that\
families are meant\
9:25\
to remain together forever.\
9:28\
And I know that our\
Lord, Jesus Christ,\
9:30\
leads this, His restored\
Church, through our living\
9:34\
prophet, President\
Russell M. Nelson, today.\
9:38\
These and many other\
precious truths\
9:40\
have become spiritual\
building blocks of what\
9:43\
God is helping me to become.\
9:45\
And I look forward to the many\
new teachings that He still\
9:49\
wants me--and you--to receive\
as we go through this wonderful\
9:54\
life and learn "even by\
study and also by faith."\
10:00\
I know these things to be true\
and testify of them in the name\
10:03\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
