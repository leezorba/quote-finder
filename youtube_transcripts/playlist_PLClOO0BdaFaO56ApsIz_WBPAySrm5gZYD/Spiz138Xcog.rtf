In two weeks we will\
celebrate Easter.\
0:04\
The Resurrection confirms\
the divinity of Jesus Christ\
0:08\
and the reality\
of God the Father.\
0:10\
Our thoughts turn to\
the Savior, and we\
0:13\
ponder "His matchless life\
and the infinite virtue\
0:17\
of His great atoning sacrifice."\
0:19\
I hope we also think about His\
pending return when "He will\
0:25\
rule as King of Kings and ...\
0:27\
Lord of Lords."\
0:29\
Some time ago in Buenos\
Aires, Argentina,\
0:32\
I participated in a\
conference with leaders\
0:35\
from a wide variety\
of religious faiths.\
0:39\
Their love for their\
fellowman was unmistakable.\
0:42\
They were intent on relieving\
suffering and helping\
0:46\
people rise above\
oppression and poverty.\
0:49\
I reflected on the numerous\
humanitarian undertakings\
0:53\
of this Church, including\
projects in collaboration\
0:57\
with a number of the\
faith groups represented\
1:00\
in the conference.\
1:01\
I felt deep gratitude\
for the generosity\
1:05\
of the members of The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
1:08\
Saints that makes such\
Christlike service possible.\
1:14\
In that moment, the Holy Spirit\
affirmed two things to me.\
1:18\
First, the work of\
ministering to temporal needs\
1:23\
is vital and must continue.\
1:26\
The second was unexpected,\
yet powerful and clear.\
1:29\
It was this: beyond\
selfless service,\
1:33\
it is supremely important\
to prepare the world\
1:37\
for the Second Coming of\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
1:42\
When He comes,\
oppression and injustice\
1:44\
will not only diminish;\
they will cease:\
1:48\
"The wolf also shall\
dwell with the lamb,\
1:50\
and the leopard shall\
lie down with the kid,\
1:53\
and the calf and the young lion\
and [the] fatling together;\
1:56\
and a little child\
shall lead them. ...\
2:00\
"They shall not hurt nor\
destroy in all my holy mountain,\
2:05\
for the earth shall be full\
of the knowledge of the Lord,\
2:07\
as the waters cover the sea."\
2:11\
Poverty and suffering will not\
only decline; they will vanish:\
2:17\
"They shall hunger no more,\
neither thirst any more;\
2:20\
neither shall the sun light\
on them, nor any heat.\
2:24\
"For the Lamb which is in\
the midst of the throne\
2:26\
shall feed them, and shall\
lead them unto living fountains\
2:30\
of waters; and God shall\
wipe away all tears\
2:34\
from their eyes."\
2:36\
Even the pain and sorrow\
of death will be done away:\
2:40\
"In that day an infant shall\
not die until he is old;\
2:44\
and his life shall be\
as the age of a tree;\
2:47\
"And when he dies\
he shall not sleep,\
2:49\
that is to say in\
the earth, but shall\
2:52\
be changed in the twinkling of\
an eye, and shall be caught up,\
2:56\
and his rest shall be glorious."\
2:59\
So yes, let us do all we can\
to relieve suffering and sorrow\
3:04\
now, and let us devote\
ourselves more diligently\
3:09\
to the preparations needed for\
the day when pain and evil are\
3:13\
ended altogether, when "Christ\
[shall] reign personally upon\
3:18\
the earth; and ... the earth\
[shall] be renewed and receive\
3:20\
its paradisiacal glory."\
3:22\
It will be a day of\
redemption and judgment.\
3:27\
The Anglican Bishop of\
Durham, Dr. N. T. Wright,\
3:31\
has aptly described\
the significance\
3:34\
of Christ's Atonement,\
Resurrection,\
3:37\
and Judgment in overcoming\
injustice and putting\
3:41\
all things right.\
3:42\
He said:\
3:45\
"God has fixed a day on which\
he will have the world judged\
3:49\
rightly by a man whom he has\
appointed--and of this he has\
3:55\
given assurance to all by\
raising this man from the dead.\
4:00\
The facts about\
Jesus of Nazareth,\
4:03\
and especially about his\
resurrection from the dead,\
4:06\
are the foundation of the\
assurance that the world is not\
4:10\
random.\
4:11\
It is not ultimately\
a chaos; that\
4:15\
when we do justice\
in the present\
4:18\
we are not whistling\
in the dark,\
4:20\
trying to shore up a building\
that will ultimately collapse,\
4:23\
or to fix a car\
which is actually\
4:26\
bound for the scrap-heap.\
4:28\
When God raised\
Jesus from the dead,\
4:31\
that was the microcosmic\
event in which the ultimate\
4:35\
macrocosmic act of judgment\
was contained in a nutshell,\
4:40\
[the] seed ... of\
the ultimate hope.\
4:43\
God declared, in the most\
powerful way imaginable,\
4:47\
that Jesus of Nazareth\
really was the Messiah. ...\
4:53\
In the greatest irony\
of history, [Jesus]\
4:56\
himself underwent cruel\
and unjust judgment,\
5:00\
coming to the place which\
symbolized and drew together\
5:04\
all the myriad cruelties\
and injustices of history,\
5:08\
to bear that chaos, that\
darkness, that cruelty,\
5:12\
that injustice, in himself,\
and to exhaust its power."\
5:20\
While at the\
conference in Buenos\
5:22\
Aires that I mentioned earlier,\
the Spirit made clear to me\
5:26\
that The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
5:29\
is uniquely empowered\
and commissioned\
5:31\
to accomplish the necessary\
preparations for the Lord's\
5:35\
Second Coming; indeed, it was\
restored for that purpose.\
5:40\
Can you find anywhere\
else a people\
5:42\
who embrace the present era as\
the prophesied "dispensation\
5:47\
of the fulness of\
times," in which God\
5:49\
has purposed to "gather together\
in one all things in Christ"?\
5:56\
If you don't find\
here a community\
6:00\
intent on accomplishing what\
needs to be accomplished\
6:04\
for both the living and the\
dead to prepare for that day,\
6:07\
if you don't find here an\
organization willing to commit\
6:11\
vast amounts of time and\
funds to the gathering\
6:14\
and preparation of\
a covenant people\
6:17\
ready to receive the Lord,\
you won't find it anywhere.\
6:22\
Speaking to the Church in\
1831, the Lord declared:\
6:27\
"The keys of the kingdom of\
God are committed unto man\
6:29\
on the earth, and from thence\
shall the gospel roll forth\
6:33\
unto the ends of the earth. ...\
6:35\
"Call upon the Lord, that\
his kingdom may go forth\
6:38\
upon the earth, that\
the inhabitants thereof\
6:40\
may receive it, and be\
prepared for the days to come,\
6:44\
in the which the Son\
of Man shall come down\
6:47\
in heaven, clothed in the\
brightness of his glory,\
6:50\
to meet the kingdom of God\
which is set up on the earth."\
6:56\
What can we do to\
prepare now for that day?\
6:59\
We can prepare\
ourselves as a people,\
7:02\
we can gather the\
Lord's covenant people,\
7:05\
and we can help redeem the\
promise of salvation "made\
7:08\
to the fathers," our ancestors.\
7:11\
All of this must occur in\
some substantial measure\
7:15\
before the Lord comes again.\
7:18\
First, and crucial\
for the Lord's return,\
7:20\
is the presence on the\
earth of a people prepared\
7:23\
to receive Him at His coming.\
7:25\
He has stated that those who\
remain upon the earth in that\
7:29\
day, "from the least\
[to] the greatest, ...\
7:32\
shall be filled with the\
knowledge of the Lord,\
7:34\
and shall see eye to eye, and\
shall lift up their voice,\
7:38\
and with the voice together\
sing this new song, saying:\
7:43\
The Lord hath brought\
again Zion. ...\
7:45\
The Lord hath gathered\
all things in one.\
7:48\
The Lord hath brought\
down Zion from above.\
7:51\
The Lord hath brought\
up Zion from beneath."\
7:56\
In ancient times, God took\
the righteous city of Zion\
7:59\
to Himself.\
8:00\
By contrast, in the\
last days a new Zion\
8:03\
will receive the\
Lord at His return.\
8:06\
Zion is the pure in heart,\
a people of one heart\
8:10\
and one mind, dwelling\
in righteousness\
8:13\
with no poor among them.\
8:15\
The Prophet Joseph\
Smith stated, "We\
8:18\
ought to have the building up\
of Zion as our greatest object."\
8:22\
We build up Zion in our homes,\
wards, branches, and stakes\
8:27\
through unity,\
godliness, and charity.\
8:32\
We must acknowledge that the\
building up of Zion occurs\
8:35\
in tumultuous times--"a day\
of wrath, a day of burning,\
8:39\
a day of desolation, of\
weeping, of mourning,\
8:42\
and of lamentation; and as a\
whirlwind it shall come upon\
8:46\
all the face of the\
earth, saith the Lord."\
8:48\
Thus, the gathering into\
stakes becomes "for a defense,\
8:52\
and for a refuge from\
the storm, and from wrath\
8:55\
when it shall be poured\
out without mixture\
8:57\
upon the whole earth."\
8:59\
Just as in former times,\
we "meet together oft,\
9:02\
to fast and to pray,\
and to speak one\
9:04\
with another concerning\
the welfare of [our] souls.\
9:07\
And ... to partake of\
the bread and [water],\
9:09\
in remembrance of\
the Lord Jesus."\
9:12\
As President Russell M. Nelson\
explained in general conference\
9:15\
last October, "The long-standing\
objective of the Church\
9:20\
is to assist all members\
to increase their faith\
9:23\
in our Lord Jesus Christ\
and in His Atonement,\
9:26\
to assist them in\
making and keeping\
9:28\
their covenants with God,\
and to strengthen and seal\
9:31\
their families."\
9:33\
Accordingly, he emphasizes\
the significance\
9:36\
of temple covenants,\
hallowing the Sabbath,\
9:39\
and a daily feasting upon\
the gospel, centered at home\
9:43\
and supported by an integrated\
study curriculum at church.\
9:48\
We want to know about the Lord,\
and we want to know the Lord.\
9:54\
An underlying effort\
in building Zion\
9:56\
is the gathering of the Lord's\
long-dispersed covenant people.\
9:59\
"We believe in the literal\
gathering of Israel\
10:02\
and in the restoration\
of the Ten Tribes."\
10:05\
All who will repent, believe\
on Christ, and be baptized\
10:09\
are His covenant people.\
10:11\
The Lord Himself prophesied\
that before His return,\
10:14\
the gospel would be preached in\
all the world "to recover [His]\
10:18\
people, which are of\
the house of Israel,"\
10:20\
"and then shall the end come."\
10:23\
Jeremiah's prophecy\
is being fulfilled:\
10:27\
"Therefore, behold,\
the days come, saith\
10:29\
the Lord, that [they]\
shall no more [say],\
10:32\
The Lord liveth, that brought\
up the children of Israel\
10:34\
out of the land of Egypt;\
10:36\
"But, The Lord liveth,\
that brought up\
10:38\
the children of Israel\
from the land of the north,\
10:40\
and from all the lands\
whither he had driven them:\
10:43\
and I will bring them\
again into their land\
10:46\
that I gave unto their fathers."\
10:49\
President Nelson has\
repeatedly emphasized\
10:51\
that the "gathering [of Israel]\
is the most important thing\
10:54\
taking place on earth today.\
10:56\
Nothing else compares\
in magnitude,\
10:59\
nothing else compares in\
importance, nothing else\
11:02\
compares in majesty.\
11:04\
And if you choose to, ...\
you can be a big part of it."\
11:07\
The Latter-day\
Saints have always\
11:09\
been a missionary people.\
11:11\
Hundreds of thousands have\
responded to mission calls\
11:14\
since the beginning of the\
Restoration; tens of thousands\
11:17\
currently serve.\
11:19\
And, as Elder Quentin L. Cook\
has just taught, all of us\
11:22\
can participate in\
simple and natural ways\
11:25\
in love, inviting others\
to join us at church,\
11:28\
visit in our homes,\
become part of our circle.\
11:32\
Publication of\
the Book of Mormon\
11:34\
was the signal that the\
gathering had begun.\
11:37\
The Book of Mormon\
itself is the instrument\
11:40\
of gathering and conversion.\
11:43\
Also vital to the preparation\
for the Second Coming\
11:46\
is the great redemptive effort\
on behalf of our ancestors.\
11:50\
The Lord promised to send Elijah\
the prophet before the Second\
11:53\
Coming, "the great and\
dreadful day of the Lord,"\
11:56\
to "reveal ... the Priesthood"\
and "plant in the hearts\
11:59\
of the children the promises\
made to the fathers."\
12:02\
Elijah did come as promised.\
12:04\
The date was April\
3, 1836; the place\
12:08\
was the Kirtland Ohio Temple.\
12:10\
In that place and\
in that moment,\
12:13\
he did indeed confer\
the promised priesthood,\
12:15\
the keys for the\
redemption of the dead\
12:18\
and the union of husbands,\
wives, and families\
12:21\
across all generations of time\
and throughout all eternity.\
12:25\
Without this, the purpose of\
creation would be frustrated,\
12:33\
and in that sense,\
the earth would be\
12:35\
"cursed" or "utterly wasted."\
12:38\
At the youth devotional\
preceding the dedication\
12:40\
of the Rome Italy\
Temple, the hundreds\
12:43\
of young men and\
women in attendance\
12:45\
displayed to President\
Nelson the cards\
12:47\
they had prepared with\
names of their ancestors.\
12:50\
They were ready to\
enter the temple\
12:52\
to perform vicarious\
baptisms for those ancestors\
12:55\
as soon as it opened.\
12:57\
It was a supremely gratifying\
moment, yet but one example\
13:02\
of the accelerating\
effort to establish\
13:04\
Zion for the generations\
that have gone before.\
13:09\
While we strive to be diligent\
in building up Zion, including\
13:13\
our part in the gathering\
of the Lord's elect\
13:16\
and the redemption\
of the dead, we\
13:18\
should pause to remember\
that it is the Lord's work\
13:21\
and He is doing it.\
13:23\
He is the Lord of the vineyard,\
and we are His servants.\
13:29\
He bids us labor in the\
vineyard with our might\
13:32\
this "last time," and\
He labors with us.\
13:35\
It would probably be more\
accurate to say He permits us\
13:39\
to labor with Him.\
13:41\
As Paul said, "I have\
planted, Apollos watered;\
13:46\
but God gave the increase."\
13:48\
It is He who is hastening\
His work in its time.\
13:52\
Employing our admittedly\
imperfect efforts,\
13:57\
our "small means," the Lord\
brings about great things.\
14:03\
This great and last dispensation\
is building steadily to its\
14:07\
climax--Zion on earth being\
joined with Zion from above\
14:12\
at the Savior's glorious return.\
14:15\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
is commissioned to prepare\
14:19\
and is preparing the\
world for that day.\
14:23\
And so this Easter,\
let us truly celebrate\
14:26\
the Resurrection of Jesus\
Christ and all that it portends:\
14:31\
His return to reign for a\
thousand years of peace,\
14:35\
a righteous judgment\
and perfect justice\
14:38\
for all, the immortality of all\
who ever lived upon this earth,\
14:44\
and the promise of eternal life.\
14:47\
Christ's Resurrection is\
the ultimate assurance\
14:50\
that all will be put right.\
14:53\
Let us be about building\
up Zion to hasten that day.\
14:57\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
