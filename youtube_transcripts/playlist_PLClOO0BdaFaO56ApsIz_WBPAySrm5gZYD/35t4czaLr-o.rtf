My beloved brothers\
and sisters, as we\
0:04\
come to the end of this\
historic conference,\
0:07\
we thank the Lord for His\
inspiration and protection.\
0:11\
The messages have\
instructed and edified us.\
0:16\
Topics were not assigned\
to the speakers.\
0:19\
They each prayed for\
personal revelation\
0:22\
in preparing their messages.\
0:24\
To me, it is remarkable\
how these themes seem\
0:28\
to fit so well with each other.\
0:31\
As you study them,\
seek to learn what\
0:34\
the Lord is trying to teach\
you through His servants.\
0:39\
The music has been glorious.\
0:41\
We are deeply grateful\
to the many musicians who\
0:44\
have blended their talents to\
bring the Spirit of the Lord\
0:47\
into each session.\
0:49\
And He has blessed the\
prayers and the congregations\
0:53\
in every session.\
0:55\
Truly, conference has again been\
a spiritual feast for us all.\
1:02\
We hope and pray that each\
member's home will become\
1:05\
a true sanctuary of faith,\
where the Spirit of the Lord\
1:09\
may dwell.\
1:11\
Despite contention\
all around us,\
1:15\
one's home can become\
a heavenly place\
1:19\
where study, prayer, and\
faith can be merged with love.\
1:26\
We can truly become\
disciples of the Lord,\
1:29\
standing up and speaking\
up for Him wherever we are.\
1:35\
God's objective should\
be our objective.\
1:39\
He wants His children to choose\
to return to Him, prepared,\
1:44\
qualified, endowed,\
sealed, and faithful\
1:49\
to covenants made\
in holy temples.\
1:54\
We now have 162\
dedicated temples.\
1:59\
The earliest ones\
stand as monuments\
2:04\
to the faith and vision\
of our beloved pioneers.\
2:08\
Each temple constructed\
by them resulted\
2:13\
from their great personal\
sacrifice and effort.\
2:18\
Each one stands as\
a stunning jewel\
2:21\
in the crown of\
pioneer achievement.\
2:26\
Ours is a sacred responsibility\
to care for them.\
2:31\
Therefore, these pioneer\
temples will soon\
2:37\
undergo a period of renewal\
and refreshing and, for some,\
2:42\
a major restoration.\
2:45\
Efforts will be made to\
preserve the unique historicity\
2:49\
of each temple wherever\
possible, preserving\
2:52\
the inspiring beauty and unique\
craftsmanship of generations\
2:57\
long since passed.\
3:00\
Details for the St.\
George Utah Temple\
3:03\
have already been released.\
3:05\
Plans for the renovation of\
the Salt Lake Temple, Temple\
3:10\
Square, and the adjoining plaza\
near the Church Office Building\
3:14\
will be announced on\
Friday, April 19, 2019.\
3:18\
The Manti and Logan\
Temples will also\
3:25\
be renovated in coming years.\
3:27\
When those plans are prepared,\
they too will be announced.\
3:33\
This work will require\
that each temple\
3:35\
be closed for a period of time.\
3:38\
Church members may\
continue to enjoy\
3:41\
temple worship and service\
in other temples nearby.\
3:46\
When each project is\
completed, each historic temple\
3:51\
will be rededicated.\
3:56\
Brothers and sisters,\
we regard a temple\
4:00\
as the most sacred\
structure in the Church.\
4:04\
As we announce plans to\
construct a new temple,\
4:09\
it becomes part of\
our sacred history.\
4:14\
Now please listen\
carefully and reverently.\
4:20\
If I announce a temple in a\
place that is special to you,\
4:25\
may I suggest that you\
simply bow your head\
4:28\
with a silent prayer of\
gratitude in your heart.\
4:32\
We do not want any\
verbal outburst\
4:35\
to detract from the sacred\
nature of this conference\
4:38\
and the Lord's holy temples.\
4:42\
Today we are pleased\
to announce plans\
4:44\
to construct more temples\
to be built in the following\
4:47\
locations:\
4:50\
Pago Pago, American Samoa;\
Okinawa City, Okinawa;\
4:56\
Neiafu, Tonga; Tooele Valley,\
Utah; Moses Lake, Washington;\
5:05\
San Pedro Sula, Honduras;\
Antofagasta, Chile;\
5:11\
and Budapest, Hungary.\
5:17\
Thank you, my dear\
brothers and sisters.\
5:21\
As we speak of our\
temples old and new,\
5:23\
may each of us\
signify by our actions\
5:26\
that we are true disciples\
of the Lord Jesus Christ.\
5:30\
May we renovate our lives\
through our faith and trust\
5:34\
in Him.\
5:35\
May we access the\
power of His Atonement\
5:38\
by our repentance every day.\
5:41\
And may we dedicate and\
rededicate our lives to serving\
5:45\
God and His children--on\
both sides of the veil.\
5:51\
I leave my love and\
blessing with you,\
5:54\
assuring you that\
revelation continues\
5:57\
in this the Lord's Church.\
6:00\
It will continue until\
"the purposes of God\
6:04\
shall be accomplished,\
and the Great Jehovah\
6:07\
shall say the work is done."\
6:11\
I so bless you and bear my\
testimony that God lives!\
6:14\
Jesus is the Christ!\
6:16\
This is His Church.\
6:18\
We are His people.\
6:20\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
