at this season of the year we\
particularly rejoice and reflect upon\
0:04\
the Savior's atonement it is indeed the\
most supernal\
0:07\
mind-expanding passionate doctrine this\
world or universe has ever known it is\
0:12\
what gives hope and purpose to our lives\
then what then is the atonement of Jesus\
0:18\
Christ in one sense it is a series of\
divine events that commenced in the\
0:23\
Garden of Gethsemane continued on the\
cross and culminated with the Savior's\
0:27\
resurrection from the tomb it was\
motivated by an incomprehensible love\
0:32\
for each of us it required a being who\
was sinless who had infinite power over\
0:38\
the elements even death who possessed a\
boundless capacity to suffer the\
0:43\
consequences of all our sins and\
ailments and who in fact descended\
0:48\
beneath it all this was the mission of\
Jesus Christ\
0:51\
this was his atonement what then is its\
purpose\
0:56\
it was to make it possible for us to\
return to God's presence become more\
1:02\
like him and have a fullness of joy this\
was done by overcoming four obstacles\
1:08\
first physical death second spiritual\
death caused by Adam and by our sins\
1:15\
third our afflictions and infirmities\
and fourth our weaknesses and\
1:20\
imperfections but how can the Savior\
accomplish this without violating the\
1:26\
laws of justice suppose for a moment a\
man contemplating an exhilarating free\
1:32\
fall makes a rash decision and\
spontaneously jumps from a small plane\
1:37\
after doing so he quickly realizes the\
foolishness of his actions he wants to\
1:44\
land safely but there is an obstacle the\
law of gravity he moves his arms with\
1:50\
astounding speed hoping to fly but to no\
avail\
1:54\
he positions his body to glide or float\
so to slow the descent but the law of\
2:00\
gravity is unrelenting and unmerciful he\
tries to reason with this basic law of\
2:06\
nature it was a mistake I will never do\
it again\
2:10\
but his pleas fall on deaf ears the law\
of gravity knows no compassion it makes\
2:16\
no exceptions\
fortuitously though the man suddenly\
2:20\
feels something on his back his friend\
in the plane sensing the moment of\
2:26\
foolishness had placed a parachute there\
just before the jump he finds the\
2:31\
ripcord and pulls it relieved he floats\
safely to the ground we might ask was\
2:38\
the law of gravity violated or did that\
parachute work within that law to\
2:43\
provide a safe landing when we sin we\
are like the foolish man who jumped from\
2:48\
the plane no matter what we do on our\
own\
2:51\
only a crash landing awaits us we are\
subject to the law of justice which like\
2:57\
the law of gravity is exacting and\
unforgiving we can be saved only because\
3:02\
the Savior through his atonement\
mercifully provides us with a spiritual\
3:07\
parachute of sorts if we have faith in\
Jesus Christ and repent meaning we do\
3:12\
our part and pull the ripcord then the\
protective powers of the Saviour are\
3:17\
unleashed on our behalf and we can land\
spiritually unharmed this is only\
3:24\
possible however because the Savior\
overcame the four obstacles that can\
3:29\
prevent our spiritual progress first\
death he overcame death through his\
3:35\
glorious resurrection the Apostle Paul\
taught as in Adam all die even so in\
3:40\
Christ shall all be made alive second\
sin the Savior overcame sin and guilt\
3:47\
for all those who repent so deep an\
expansive hisses cleansing power that\
3:53\
Isaiah promised up promised though your\
sins be as scarlet they shall be as\
3:57\
white as snow on occasion I have met\
with good Saints who have trouble\
4:02\
forgiving themselves who have innocently\
but incorrectly placed limits on the\
4:07\
Savior's redemptive powers unwittingly\
they have converted an infinite\
4:12\
atonement to a finite one that somehow\
falls short of their particular sin or\
4:17\
weakness but it is an infinite atonement\
because it encompasses and circumscribes\
4:23\
every sin and weakness as well as every\
abuse or pain caused by others\
4:28\
Truman Madson made this comforting\
observation if there are some of you\
4:33\
have been tricked into the conviction\
that you have gone too far\
4:36\
the you have had the poison of sin which\
makes it impossible ever again to be\
4:40\
what you could have been then hear me I\
bear testimony that you cannot sink\
4:45\
farther than the sweeping the light and\
sweeping intelligence of Jesus Christ\
4:50\
can reach I bear testimony that as long\
as there is one spark of the will to\
4:55\
repent and reach he is there he did not\
just descend to your condition he\
5:00\
descended below it that he might be in\
all and through all things the light of\
5:05\
truth and quote one reason is so\
essential to understand the Savior's\
5:10\
atonement and it's infinite implications\
is that with increased understanding\
5:15\
comes an increased desire to forgive\
ourselves and others even though we may\
5:22\
believe in Christ cleansing powers the\
question often arises how do I know if\
5:27\
I've been forgiven of my sins if we feel\
the spirit then that is our witness that\
5:32\
we have been forgiven or that the\
cleansing process is taking place press\
5:38\
in here newbie Irene taught if you have\
felt the influence of the Holy Ghost you\
5:44\
may take it as evidence that the\
atonement is working in your life some\
5:49\
of us but if I have been forgiven why do\
I still feel guilt perhaps in God's and\
5:55\
mercy the memory of that guilt is a\
warning a spiritual stop sign of sorts\
6:00\
that at least for time cries out when\
additional temptations confront us don't\
6:06\
go down that road you know the pain it\
can bring in this sense it serves as a\
6:12\
protection not a punishment is it\
possible then to remember our sins and\
6:18\
still be free of guilt Alma remembered\
his sins even years after he repented\
6:23\
but when he cried into Jesus for mercy\
he said I could remember my pains no\
6:28\
more yay\
I was Herald up by the memory of my sins\
6:32\
no\
how could he remember his sins but have\
6:37\
no pain or guilt because when we repent\
we are born of God we become as the\
6:43\
scriptures say new creatures in Christ\
with perfect honesty we can now say I am\
6:49\
NOT the man or woman who committed those\
past sins I am a new and transformed\
6:55\
being third afflictions and infirmities\
Alma prophesied that Christ shall go\
7:01\
forth suffering pains and afflictions\
and temptations of every kind why that\
7:06\
his bowels may be filled with mercy that\
he may know according to the flesh how\
7:10\
to succor his people according to their\
infirmities\
7:13\
how does he accomplish this sometimes he\
removes the affliction sometimes he\
7:20\
strengthens us to endure and sometimes\
he gives us an eternal perspective to\
7:24\
better understand their temporary nature\
after Joseph Smith had languished in\
7:29\
Liberty jail for about two months he\
finally cried out o God where art thou\
7:34\
instead of providing instant relief God\
responded my son peace be unto thy soul\
7:40\
that adversity and thine afflictions\
shall be but a small moment and then if\
7:45\
thou endure it well God shall exalt thee\
on high Joseph now understood that this\
7:51\
bitter experience was but a dot on the\
eternal spectrum with this enhanced\
7:57\
vision he wrote the Saints from that\
same prison cell dearly beloved brethren\
8:02\
let us cheerfully do all things that lie\
in our power and then may we stand still\
8:07\
with the utmost assurance to see the\
salvation of God because of the Savior's\
8:13\
atonement we can have an eternal\
perspective that gives meaning to our\
8:17\
trials and hope for a relief and forth\
weaknesses and imperfections because of\
8:23\
his atonement the Savior has enabling\
power sometimes referred to as grace\
8:28\
that can help us overcome our weaknesses\
and imperfections and thus assist us in\
8:33\
our pursuit to become more like him\
Moroni so taught yeh come into Christ\
8:39\
and be perfected in him that by His\
grace he may be perfect in Christ\
8:45\
there seems at least two channels or\
means of availing ourselves of those\
8:49\
enabling powers that can refine even\
perfect us first the saving ordinances\
8:56\
the Scriptures tell us in the ordinances\
thereof the power of godliness is\
9:02\
manifest sometimes when we think of\
ordinances as a checklist necessary for\
9:08\
exaltation but in truth each unleashes a\
godly power that helps us become more\
9:13\
like Christ for example when we are\
baptized and receive the gift of the\
9:18\
Holy Ghost we are made clean thus\
becoming more holy like God in addition\
9:24\
through the Holy Ghost our minds may be\
enlightened in our hearts often so we\
9:28\
can think and feel more like him and\
when we are sealed as spouses we inherit\
9:33\
the rights of Thrones kingdoms\
principalities and powers if you get as\
9:37\
gifts from God a second channel for\
these enabling powers is the gifts of\
9:42\
the Spirit because of Christ's atonement\
we are eligible to receive the gift of\
9:48\
the Holy Ghost and its accompanying\
spiritual gifts these gifts are\
9:52\
attributes of godliness therefore every\
time we acquire a gift to the spirit we\
9:58\
become more like God no doubt that is\
why the Scriptures in join us on\
10:03\
multiple occasions to seek these gifts\
President George Q cannon taught no man\
10:08\
ought to say oh I cannot help this it is\
my nature he is not justified in it for\
10:15\
the reason that God has promised to give\
gifts that will eradicate our weaknesses\
10:19\
if any of us are imperfect it is our\
duty to pray for the gift that will make\
10:25\
us perfect in summary the Savior's\
atonement gives us life for death beauty\
10:31\
for Ashes healing for hurt and\
perfection for weakness it is heaven's\
10:37\
antidote to the obstacles and struggles\
of this world in the Savior's final week\
10:42\
of mortality he said in the world ye\
shall have tribulation but be of good\
10:45\
cheer I have overcome the world because\
the Savior performed his atonement there\
10:51\
is no external force or event or person\
no sin or death or divorce that can\
10:57\
prevent\
from achieving exaltation provided we\
11:01\
keep God's commandments without\
knowledge we can press forward with good\
11:05\
sheer and absolute assurance that God is\
with us in this heavenly quest I bear my\
11:11\
witness that the Seavers atonement is\
not only infinite in scope but\
11:15\
individual and reach that it cannot only\
return us to God's presence but enable\
11:20\
us to become like him the crowning goal\
of Christ's atonement of that I bear my\
11:26\
grateful and certain witness in the name\
of Jesus Christ amen\
11:40\
you\
