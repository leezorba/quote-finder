Many times I have heard\
priesthood leaders give\
0:14\
thanks for the sustaining\
faith of those they serve.\
0:19\
From the emotion\
in their voices,\
0:22\
you know their gratitude\
is deep and real.\
0:25\
My purpose today is to convey\
the Lord's appreciation\
0:32\
for your sustaining His\
servants in His Church.\
0:37\
And it is also to encourage\
you to exercise and grow\
0:42\
in that power to sustain\
others with your faith.\
0:47\
Before you were born, you\
demonstrated such power.\
0:52\
Think back to what we\
know of the spirit world\
0:56\
before we were born.\
0:58\
Our Heavenly Father presented\
a plan for His children.\
1:03\
We were there.\
1:05\
You and I, all of us.\
1:08\
Lucifer, our spirit\
brother, opposed\
1:12\
that plan that would allow\
us freedom to choose.\
1:16\
Jehovah, the Beloved\
Son of Heavenly Father,\
1:20\
sustained the plan.\
1:23\
Lucifer led a rebellion.\
1:26\
Jehovah's sustaining\
voice prevailed,\
1:30\
and He volunteered\
to be our Savior.\
1:35\
The fact that you\
are in mortality\
1:37\
now assures us\
that you sustained\
1:42\
the Father and the Savior.\
1:44\
It took faith in Jesus Christ\
to sustain the plan of happiness\
1:50\
and Jesus Christ's\
place in it when\
1:53\
you knew so little\
of the challenges\
1:55\
that you would\
face in mortality.\
1:59\
Your faith to sustain\
servants of God\
2:02\
has been at the heart of your\
happiness in this life as well.\
2:07\
For example, when you accepted\
a missionary's challenge\
2:12\
to pray to know that the Book\
of Mormon was the word of God,\
2:17\
you had the faith to sustain\
a servant of the Lord.\
2:22\
When you accepted the\
invitation to be baptized,\
2:26\
you sustained a\
humble servant of God.\
2:31\
When you let someone place\
hands on your head and say,\
2:34\
"Receive the Holy\
Ghost," you sustained him\
2:38\
as a holder of the\
Melchizedek Priesthood.\
2:42\
Since that day, you have,\
by serving faithfully,\
2:47\
sustained each person who\
has conferred the priesthood\
2:51\
upon you and each\
who has ordained you\
2:54\
to an office in that priesthood.\
2:57\
Early in your\
priesthood experience,\
2:59\
each sustaining\
was a simple event\
3:03\
of trusting a servant of God.\
3:06\
Now many of you have moved up\
to a place where to sustain\
3:13\
requires more.\
3:16\
You choose whether to sustain\
all whom the Lord calls--in\
3:20\
whatever the Lord\
has called them.\
3:23\
That choice happens in\
conferences all over the world.\
3:28\
It has happened in this one.\
3:31\
In such meetings, names of men\
and women--servants of God--are\
3:36\
read, and you are invited to\
raise your hand to sustain.\
3:41\
You can withhold\
your sustaining vote,\
3:45\
or you can pledge\
your sustaining faith.\
3:48\
By raising your hand to\
sustain, you make a promise.\
3:53\
You make a promise with God,\
whose servants these are,\
3:58\
that you will sustain them.\
4:02\
Now, these are imperfect\
human beings, as are you.\
4:07\
Keeping your promises\
will take unshakable faith\
4:11\
that the Lord called them.\
4:14\
Keeping those promises will\
also bring eternal happiness.\
4:19\
Not keeping them will bring\
sorrow to you and to those you\
4:24\
love--and even losses beyond\
your power to imagine.\
4:31\
You may have been\
asked, or you will\
4:33\
be, whether you sustain your\
bishop, stake president,\
4:37\
the General Authorities, and the\
General Officers of the Church.\
4:42\
It may happen as you are\
asked to sustain officers\
4:45\
and leaders in a conference.\
4:47\
Sometimes it will be in\
an interview with a bishop\
4:51\
or stake president.\
4:54\
My counsel to you is you ask\
those questions of yourself\
4:59\
beforehand, with careful\
and prayerful thought.\
5:04\
As you do, you might look back\
on your recent thoughts, words,\
5:10\
and deeds.\
5:12\
Try to remember and\
frame the answers\
5:15\
you will give when the\
Lord interviews you,\
5:18\
knowing that He someday will.\
5:21\
You could prepare\
by asking yourself\
5:24\
questions like the following:\
5:26\
1.\
5:29\
Have I thought or spoken of\
human weaknesses in the people\
5:35\
I have pledged to sustain?\
5:38\
2.\
5:39\
Have I looked for evidence\
that the Lord is leading them?\
5:42\
3.\
5:46\
Have I conscientiously\
and loyally\
5:48\
followed their leadership?\
5:52\
4.\
5:53\
Have I spoken about\
the evidence I can see\
5:56\
that they are God's servants?\
6:00\
5.\
6:00\
Do I pray for them regularly by\
name and with feelings of love?\
6:09\
Those questions\
will, for most of us,\
6:11\
lead to some uneasiness\
and a need to repent.\
6:16\
We are commanded by God not\
to judge others unrighteously,\
6:20\
but in practice we find\
that hard to avoid.\
6:24\
Almost everything we do\
in working with people\
6:27\
leads us to evaluate them.\
6:30\
And in almost every\
aspect of our lives,\
6:33\
we compare ourselves\
with others.\
6:36\
We may do so for many reasons,\
some of them reasonable,\
6:41\
but it often leads\
us to be critical.\
6:46\
President George Q. Cannon gave\
a warning that I pass on to you\
6:52\
as my own.\
6:54\
I believe he spoke the truth:\
"God has chosen His servants.\
7:02\
He claims it as His\
prerogative to condemn them\
7:06\
if they need condemnation.\
7:09\
He has not given it\
to us individually\
7:13\
to censure and condemn them.\
7:16\
No man, however strong\
he may be in the faith,\
7:21\
however high in\
the Priesthood, can\
7:25\
speak evil of the\
Lord's anointed\
7:28\
and find fault with\
God's authority on earth\
7:32\
without incurring\
His displeasure.\
7:36\
The Holy Spirit will withdraw\
himself from such a man,\
7:41\
and he will go into darkness.\
7:44\
This being the case, do you\
not see how important it\
7:49\
is that we should be careful?"\
7:53\
Now, my observation\
is that the members\
7:55\
of the Church\
across the world are\
7:57\
generally loyal to\
each other and to those\
8:00\
who preside over them.\
8:02\
There are, however, improvements\
we could and must make.\
8:07\
We could rise higher in our\
power to sustain each other.\
8:12\
It will take faith and effort.\
8:15\
Here are four\
suggestions I make for us\
8:18\
to act on at this conference.\
8:22\
1.\
8:23\
We could identify specific\
actions the speakers recommend\
8:28\
and start today\
to carry them out.\
8:31\
As we do, our power to\
sustain them will increase.\
8:38\
2.\
8:39\
We could pray for them as they\
speak that the Holy Ghost will\
8:43\
carry their words into the\
hearts of specific people\
8:47\
we love.\
8:48\
When we learn later that\
our prayer was answered,\
8:52\
our power to sustain those\
leaders will increase.\
8:55\
3.\
8:56\
We could pray that\
specific speakers\
9:00\
will be blessed and magnified\
as they give their messages.\
9:05\
When we see that\
they were magnified,\
9:08\
we will grow in our\
faith to sustain them,\
9:12\
and it will endure.\
9:14\
4.\
9:15\
We could listen for\
messages from the speakers\
9:19\
that come as an answer to our\
personal prayers for help.\
9:24\
When the answers come, and\
I promise you they will,\
9:30\
we will grow in our\
faith to sustain\
9:33\
all the Lord's servants.\
9:36\
In addition to improving\
in sustaining those\
9:39\
who serve in the\
Church, we will learn\
9:42\
that there is another\
setting in which we\
9:44\
can increase in such power.\
9:47\
There it can bring even\
greater blessings to us.\
9:51\
It is in the home and family.\
9:55\
I speak to the younger\
priesthood holder\
9:58\
who lives in a home\
with his father.\
10:01\
Let me tell you from\
my own experience what\
10:05\
it means for a father to\
feel your sustaining faith.\
10:09\
He may look confident to you.\
10:12\
But he faces more\
challenges than you know.\
10:16\
At times he can't see the\
way through the problems\
10:19\
before him.\
10:22\
Your admiration for\
him will help him some.\
10:25\
Your love for him\
will help even more.\
10:28\
But the thing that\
will help the most\
10:30\
is sincere words like these:\
"Dad, I've prayed for you,\
10:36\
and I have felt that the\
Lord is going to help you.\
10:39\
Everything will work out.\
10:41\
I know it will."\
10:44\
Words such as those also have\
power in the other direction,\
10:48\
father to son.\
10:50\
When a son has made a\
serious mistake, perhaps\
10:55\
in a spiritual matter, he\
may feel that he has failed.\
10:58\
As his father, in\
that moment, you\
11:02\
may be surprised, after you\
pray to know what to do,\
11:06\
when the Holy Ghost puts these\
words into your mouth: "Son,\
11:13\
I'm with you all the way.\
11:16\
The Lord loves you.\
11:18\
With His help, you\
can make it back.\
11:21\
I know that you can\
and that you will.\
11:24\
I love you."\
11:27\
In the priesthood quorum\
and in the family,\
11:30\
increased faith to\
sustain each other\
11:34\
is the way we build the Zion\
the Lord wants us to create.\
11:39\
With His help, we\
can and we will.\
11:42\
It will take learning to love\
the Lord with all our heart,\
11:46\
might, mind, and strength\
and to love each other as we\
11:50\
love ourselves.\
11:53\
As we grow in that pure love\
of Christ, our hearts soften.\
11:57\
That love will humble us\
and lead us to repent.\
12:02\
Our confidence in the Lord\
and each other will grow.\
12:06\
And then we will move\
toward becoming one,\
12:09\
as the Lord promises we can.\
12:13\
I testify that Heavenly\
Father knows and loves you.\
12:18\
Jesus is the living Christ.\
12:21\
This is His Church.\
12:23\
We hold His priesthood.\
12:27\
He will honor our\
efforts to grow\
12:30\
in our power to exercise it\
and to sustain each other.\
12:35\
I so witness in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
