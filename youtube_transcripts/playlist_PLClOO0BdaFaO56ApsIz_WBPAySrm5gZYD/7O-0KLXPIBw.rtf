My dear brothers\
and sisters, I am\
0:05\
grateful to have\
been invited to speak\
0:09\
to you in this\
189th Annual General\
0:14\
Conference of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
0:19\
Saints.\
0:22\
On this date in\
1830, Joseph Smith\
0:28\
organized the Church under\
the direction of the Lord.\
0:35\
It was done in\
the Whitmer family\
0:37\
home in Fayette, New York.\
0:42\
There were six members and\
about 50 other interested people\
0:46\
there that day.\
0:50\
Although I don't know what\
the Prophet Joseph said\
0:55\
or how he looked when he stood\
before that little group,\
1:02\
but I know what those people\
with faith in Jesus Christ\
1:05\
felt. They felt the Holy\
Ghost, and they felt\
1:11\
that they were in a holy place.\
1:15\
They surely felt that\
they were united as one.\
1:21\
That miraculous\
feeling in a home\
1:24\
is what we all\
want in our homes.\
1:30\
It is a feeling that\
comes from being,\
1:32\
as Paul described,\
"spiritually minded."\
1:38\
My purpose today\
is to teach what\
1:42\
I know of how we can qualify\
for that feeling more often\
1:47\
and invite it to last\
longer in our families.\
1:55\
As you know from experience,\
that is not easy to do.\
1:59\
Contention, pride, and sin\
have to be kept at bay.\
2:05\
The pure love of Christ\
must come into the hearts\
2:09\
of those in our family.\
2:13\
Adam and Eve, Lehi and\
Sariah, and other parents\
2:17\
we know from scripture found\
that to be a hard challenge.\
2:22\
Yet there are encouraging\
examples of sustained felicity\
2:28\
in families and\
homes to reassure us.\
2:33\
And those examples let\
us see the way it can\
2:39\
happen for us and our families.\
2:43\
You remember the\
account from 4 Nephi:\
2:47\
"And it came to pass that there\
was no contention in the land,\
2:53\
because of the love\
of God which did dwell\
2:58\
in the hearts of the people.\
3:01\
"And there were no envyings,\
nor strifes, nor tumults,\
3:06\
nor whoredoms, nor lyings,\
nor murders, nor any manner\
3:11\
of lasciviousness; and\
surely there could not\
3:16\
be a happier people\
among all the people\
3:21\
who had been created\
by the hand of God.\
3:26\
"There were no\
robbers, nor murderers,\
3:28\
neither were there Lamanites,\
nor any manner of -ites;\
3:31\
but they were in one, the\
children of Christ, and heirs\
3:37\
to the kingdom of God.\
3:39\
"And how blessed were they!\
3:42\
For the Lord did bless\
them in all their doings;\
3:44\
yea, even they were\
blessed and prospered\
3:47\
until an hundred and ten\
years had passed away;\
3:51\
and the first generation\
from Christ had passed away,\
3:55\
and there was no contention\
in all the land."\
4:02\
As you know, that happy\
time did not endure forever.\
4:07\
The account in 4 Nephi\
describes the eventual symptoms\
4:15\
of spiritual decline among\
a group of good people.\
4:19\
It is a pattern that has\
appeared over the ages\
4:23\
to entire peoples, in\
congregations, and, most sadly,\
4:29\
in families.\
4:30\
By studying that\
pattern, we can see\
4:34\
how we might protect and even\
increase the feelings of love\
4:39\
in our family.\
4:43\
Here is the pattern\
of decline that\
4:47\
appeared after 200 years of\
living in the perfect peace\
4:52\
the gospel brings:\
4:57\
Pride crept in.\
5:00\
The people stopped sharing\
what they had with each other.\
5:05\
They began to see\
themselves in classes\
5:08\
above or below each other.\
5:12\
They began to diminish in\
their faith in Jesus Christ.\
5:18\
They began to hate.\
5:20\
They began to commit\
all kinds of sin.\
5:25\
Now, wise parents\
will be alert enough\
5:27\
to notice those symptoms when\
they appear among their family\
5:34\
members.\
5:35\
They will, of\
course, be concerned.\
5:38\
But they will know that\
the underlying cause\
5:43\
is the influence of Satan\
trying to lead good people down\
5:47\
a path to sin and thus\
to lose the influence\
5:52\
of the Holy Ghost.\
5:53\
So the wise parent will\
see that opportunity\
5:58\
lies in leading each\
child, and themselves,\
6:02\
to accept more fully the Lord's\
invitation to come unto Him.\
6:10\
You could have limited success\
by calling a child to repent,\
6:13\
for instance, of pride.\
6:15\
You might try\
persuading children\
6:18\
to share what they\
have more graciously.\
6:21\
You could ask them\
to stop feeling\
6:23\
they are better than\
someone else in the family.\
6:26\
But then you come to\
the symptom described\
6:29\
as "they began to diminish in\
their faith in Jesus Christ."\
6:36\
There is the key to leading\
your family to rise to that\
6:42\
spiritual place you want for\
them--and for you to be there\
6:47\
with them.\
6:48\
As you help them grow in\
faith that Jesus Christ is\
6:53\
their loving Redeemer, they\
will feel a desire to repent.\
6:58\
As they do, humility will\
begin to replace pride.\
7:04\
As they begin to feel what\
the Lord has given them,\
7:08\
they will want to share more\
graciously and generously.\
7:13\
Rivalry for prominence or\
recognition will diminish.\
7:19\
Hate will be driven out by love.\
7:22\
And finally, like it did\
for the people converted\
7:26\
by King Benjamin,\
the desire to do good\
7:30\
will fortify them against\
temptation to sin.\
7:34\
King Benjamin's people\
testified that they had no more\
7:38\
disposition to do evil.\
7:41\
So building faith\
in Jesus Christ\
7:46\
is the beginning of reversing\
any spiritual decline\
7:51\
in your family and in your home.\
7:53\
That faith is more likely\
to bring repentance\
7:57\
than your preaching against each\
symptom of spiritual decline.\
8:02\
You will best lead by example.\
8:04\
Family members and\
others must see\
8:07\
you growing in your own faith in\
Jesus Christ and in His gospel.\
8:13\
You have recently been\
provided great help.\
8:17\
Parents in the Church\
have been blessed\
8:20\
with an inspired curriculum\
for families and individuals.\
8:25\
As you use it, you\
will build your faith\
8:28\
and the faith of your children\
in the Lord Jesus Christ.\
8:34\
Your faith in the\
Savior has grown\
8:36\
as you followed President\
Russell M. Nelson's suggestion\
8:40\
to reread the Book of Mormon.\
8:42\
You marked passages and words\
that referred to the Savior.\
8:47\
Your faith in Jesus Christ grew.\
8:51\
But like a new plant,\
such faith in Jesus Christ\
8:56\
will wither unless you\
find continued resolve\
9:00\
to ponder and pray\
to increase it.\
9:06\
Your example of growing\
in faith may not\
9:08\
be followed by all members\
of your family now.\
9:12\
But take heart from the\
experience of Alma the Younger.\
9:17\
In his painful need for\
repentance and forgiveness,\
9:22\
he remembered his father's\
faith in Jesus Christ.\
9:26\
Your children may remember\
your faith in the Savior\
9:30\
at a moment when they\
desperately need repentance.\
9:36\
Alma said of such a moment:\
9:39\
"And it came to pass\
that as I was thus racked\
9:44\
with torment, while\
I was harrowed up\
9:47\
by the memory of my\
many sins, behold,\
9:50\
I remembered also to have\
heard my father prophesy\
9:54\
unto the people concerning\
the coming of one Jesus\
9:58\
Christ, a Son of God, to atone\
for the sins of the world.\
10:05\
"Now, as my mind caught\
hold upon this thought,\
10:08\
I cried within my heart:\
O Jesus, thou Son of God,\
10:13\
have mercy on me, who am\
in the gall of bitterness,\
10:16\
and am encircled about by the\
everlasting chains of death.\
10:21\
"And now, behold,\
when I thought this,\
10:24\
I could remember\
my pains no more;\
10:27\
yea, I was harrowed up by the\
memory of my sins no more."\
10:34\
In addition to your example\
of growing in faith,\
10:37\
your praying as a family\
can play a crucial part\
10:41\
in making home a sacred place.\
10:45\
One person is usually chosen as\
voice to pray for the family.\
10:51\
When the prayer is clearly to\
God in behalf of the people\
10:56\
kneeling and listening,\
faith grows in all of them.\
11:01\
They can feel expressions\
of love for Heavenly Father\
11:04\
and for the Savior.\
11:06\
And when the person\
who prays mentions\
11:10\
those who are kneeling in\
that circle who are in need,\
11:14\
all can feel love for them and\
for each member of the family.\
11:20\
Even when family members\
are not living in the home,\
11:23\
prayer can build bonds of love.\
11:27\
Prayer in the family can\
reach across the world.\
11:31\
More than once I have learned\
that a family member far away\
11:37\
was praying at the same moment\
for the same thing as I was.\
11:42\
For me, the old saying\
"The family that prays\
11:45\
together stays together" could\
be expanded to "The family\
11:50\
that prays together is together,\
even when they are far apart."\
11:55\
Because none of us is perfect\
and feelings are easily hurt,\
12:00\
families can become\
sacred sanctuaries\
12:04\
only as we repent\
early and sincerely.\
12:09\
Parents can set an example.\
12:12\
Harsh words or unkind\
thoughts can be repented\
12:15\
of quickly and sincerely.\
12:18\
A simple "I am sorry" can\
heal wounds and invite\
12:23\
both forgiveness and love.\
12:27\
The Prophet Joseph\
Smith was a model for us\
12:31\
as he dealt with vicious\
attacks with traitors and even\
12:35\
with disagreements\
in his family.\
12:38\
He forgave quickly\
even though he\
12:41\
knew the attacker\
might attack again.\
12:44\
He asked for forgiveness,\
and he gave it freely.\
12:49\
The sons of Mosiah\
were determined\
12:52\
to offer the gospel to everyone.\
12:55\
This desire came from\
their personal experience\
12:58\
with repentance.\
12:59\
They could not bear the\
thought of any person suffering\
13:03\
the effects of sin as they had.\
13:05\
So they faced years of\
rejection, hardship, and danger\
13:11\
to offer the gospel of Jesus\
Christ to their enemies.\
13:16\
In the process, they\
found joy in the many\
13:19\
who repented and experienced\
the joy of forgiveness\
13:23\
through the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ.\
13:26\
Our family members will\
grow in their desire\
13:30\
to share the gospel as they\
feel the joy of forgiveness.\
13:35\
That can come even as\
they renew covenants when\
13:38\
they partake of the sacrament.\
13:40\
The missionary spirit\
will grow in our homes\
13:45\
as children and parents\
feel the joy of forgiveness\
13:51\
in the sacrament service.\
13:53\
By their example of reverence,\
both parents and children\
13:57\
can help each other\
feel that joy.\
14:01\
That joy can go far\
in turning our homes\
14:07\
into missionary\
training centers.\
14:10\
All might not serve missions,\
but all will feel the desire\
14:14\
to share the gospel\
which has brought them\
14:18\
to feel forgiveness and peace.\
14:21\
And whether currently\
serving full time or not,\
14:24\
all can feel joy in offering\
the gospel to others.\
14:30\
Both for parents and\
children, the temple\
14:33\
is the best opportunity\
to gain a feeling for\
14:37\
and a love of heavenly places.\
14:40\
That is especially true\
when the children are young.\
14:43\
Children are born with\
the Light of Christ.\
14:46\
Even a baby can feel\
that a temple is sacred.\
14:50\
Because parents love\
their little children,\
14:53\
the temple represents\
for them the\
14:55\
hope that they can\
have their children\
14:57\
to love in their\
eternal family forever.\
15:02\
Some of you have photographs\
of temples in your homes.\
15:05\
As temples are being\
added across the earth,\
15:08\
it is possible for many\
parents to visit temple grounds\
15:12\
with their families.\
15:14\
A few may even be able to\
attend open houses when temples\
15:18\
are built. Parents\
can ask children\
15:22\
how they felt to be\
near or in a temple.\
15:26\
Every parent can bear\
testimony of what a temple has\
15:30\
meant to him or her.\
15:32\
President Ezra Taft\
Benson, who loved temples,\
15:35\
spoke often of watching\
his mother carefully\
15:39\
press her temple clothing.\
15:41\
He spoke of his memory as\
a boy watching his family\
15:44\
as they left his home\
to attend the temple.\
15:49\
When he was the\
President of the Church,\
15:51\
he attended the temple\
the same day each week.\
15:54\
He always did the temple\
work for an ancestor.\
15:58\
It came largely from the\
example of his parents.\
16:04\
You will find some of your\
greatest joys in your efforts\
16:07\
to make your home a place of\
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ\
16:12\
and a place that is permeated\
with love--the pure love\
16:17\
of Christ.\
16:18\
The Restoration of the gospel\
started with a humble question\
16:22\
pondered in a\
humble home, and it\
16:25\
can continue in\
each of our homes\
16:27\
as we continue to\
establish and practice\
16:31\
gospel principles there.\
16:33\
This has been my hope\
and my deepest desire\
16:37\
since I was a little boy.\
16:40\
You have all had\
glimpses of such homes.\
16:44\
Many of you have, with the\
Lord's help, created them.\
16:48\
Some have tried with full\
heart for that blessing,\
16:51\
yet it has not been granted.\
16:54\
My promise to you\
is one that a member\
16:57\
of the Quorum of the Twelve\
Apostles once made to me.\
17:01\
I had said to him that\
because of choices some\
17:04\
in our extended\
family had made, I\
17:07\
doubted that we could be\
together in the world to come.\
17:10\
He said, as well\
as I can remember,\
17:14\
"You are worrying about\
the wrong problem.\
17:18\
You just live worthy of\
the celestial kingdom,\
17:22\
and the family arrangements will\
be more wonderful than anything\
17:26\
you can imagine."\
17:29\
I believe that he would extend\
that happy hope to any of us\
17:33\
in mortality who have done all\
we can to qualify ourselves\
17:38\
and our family members\
for eternal life.\
17:41\
I know that Heavenly Father's\
plan is a plan of happiness.\
17:47\
I testify that His plan makes\
it possible for each of us who\
17:53\
has done the best we can to\
be sealed in a family forever.\
17:59\
I know that the priesthood\
keys restored to Joseph Smith\
18:03\
were passed on in\
an unbroken line\
18:07\
to President Russell\
Marion Nelson.\
18:10\
Those keys make possible the\
sealing of families today.\
18:15\
I know that Heavenly Father\
loves us, His spirit children,\
18:20\
with a perfect love.\
18:22\
I know that because of the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ,\
18:26\
we can repent, be\
cleansed, and become\
18:30\
worthy to live in\
loving families forever\
18:35\
with our Heavenly Father and\
with His Beloved Son, Jesus\
18:39\
Christ.\
18:40\
I so testify this is true in\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
