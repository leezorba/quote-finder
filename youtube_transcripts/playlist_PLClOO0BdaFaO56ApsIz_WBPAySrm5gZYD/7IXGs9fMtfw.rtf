My office in the\
Relief Society Building\
0:03\
has a perfect view of\
the Salt Lake temple.\
0:05\
And every night, as regular as\
clockwork, the outdoor temple\
0:08\
lights turn on at dusk.\
0:10\
The temple is the\
steady, reassuring beacon\
0:13\
outside my window.\
0:15\
But one night this past\
February, my office\
0:17\
remained exceptionally\
dim as the sun went down.\
0:20\
As I looked out the window,\
the temple was dark.\
0:24\
The lights hadn't turned on,\
and suddenly I felt very somber\
0:28\
because I couldn't\
see the temple\
0:30\
spires that I had glimpsed\
every single evening for years.\
0:34\
Seeing darkness where I expected\
to see light reminded me that\
0:38\
one of the fundamental needs\
we have in order to grow is\
0:41\
to stay connected to the\
source of light--Jesus Christ.\
0:45\
He is the source of our\
power, the Light and the Life\
0:49\
of the World.\
0:50\
Without a strong\
connection to Him,\
0:52\
we begin to spiritually die.\
0:54\
Knowing that, Satan tries to\
exploit the worldly pressures\
0:59\
that we all face.\
1:00\
He works to dim our light,\
short-circuit the connection,\
1:04\
cut off the power\
supply--leaving us alone\
1:07\
in the dark.\
1:08\
These pressures are common\
conditions in mortality,\
1:11\
but Satan works very hard\
to isolate us and tell us\
1:15\
we are the only ones\
experiencing them.\
1:19\
Some of us are\
paralyzed with grief.\
1:22\
When tragedies\
overtake us, when life\
1:26\
hurts so much that\
we can't breathe,\
1:28\
when we've taken a beating like\
the man on the road to Jericho\
1:32\
and been left for dead,\
Jesus comes along.\
1:36\
He pours oil into our wounds,\
he lifts us tenderly up,\
1:40\
he takes us to an inn,\
and he looks after us.\
1:42\
To those of us in grief,\
He says, "I will ...\
1:46\
ease the burdens which are\
put upon your shoulders,\
1:48\
that even you cannot feel\
them upon your backs, ...\
1:51\
that ye may know of a\
surety that I, the Lord God,\
1:54\
do visit my people in\
their afflictions."\
1:57\
Christ heals wounds.\
2:01\
Some of us are just so tired.\
2:03\
Elder Holland said: "It is not\
intended that we run faster\
2:07\
than we have strength. ...\
2:08\
But [in spite of]\
that, I know ...\
2:11\
many of you run [very,] very\
fast and that [the] energy\
2:14\
and emotional supply sometimes\
registers close to empty."\
2:18\
When expectations\
overwhelm us, we\
2:21\
can step back and ask Heavenly\
Father what to let go of.\
2:25\
Part of our life experience\
is knowing what not to do.\
2:28\
But even so, sometimes\
life can be exhausting.\
2:32\
Jesus assures us, "Come unto\
me, all ye that labour and are\
2:37\
heavy laden, and I\
will give you rest."\
2:41\
Christ is willing to\
join with us in the yoke\
2:43\
and pull in order to\
lighten our burdens.\
2:46\
Christ is rest.\
2:50\
Some of us feel we don't\
fit the traditional mold.\
2:53\
For various reasons, we don't\
feel accepted or acceptable.\
2:57\
The New Testament\
shows the great efforts\
2:59\
that Jesus went to reach\
out to all kinds of people:\
3:02\
lepers, tax collectors,\
children, Galileans, harlots,\
3:08\
women, Pharisees, sinners,\
Samaritans, widows,\
3:12\
Roman soldiers, adulterers,\
the ritually unclean.\
3:16\
In almost every\
story He is reaching\
3:19\
to someone who wasn't\
traditionally accepted\
3:21\
in society.\
3:23\
Luke 19 tells the story\
of the chief tax collector\
3:26\
in Jericho named Zacchaeus.\
3:28\
He climbed a tree in order\
to see Jesus walk by.\
3:31\
Zacchaeus was employed\
by the Roman government\
3:34\
and viewed as\
corrupt and a sinner.\
3:37\
But Jesus saw him up in\
the tree and called to him,\
3:40\
saying, "Zacchaeus, make haste,\
and come down; for to day\
3:44\
I must abide at thy house."\
3:47\
And when Jesus saw the\
goodness of Zacchaeus's heart\
3:50\
and the things that\
he did for others,\
3:52\
He accepted his\
offering, saying,\
3:55\
"This day is salvation\
come to this house, [for]\
3:59\
he also is a son of Abraham."\
4:02\
Christ tenderly\
told the Nephites,\
4:04\
"I have commanded that none\
of you should go away."\
4:07\
Peter had that powerful\
epiphany in Acts 10\
4:10\
where he declared,\
"God hath shewed me\
4:12\
that I should not call any\
[person] common or unclean."\
4:16\
It is an unwavering requirement\
of Christian disciples\
4:20\
and Latter-day Saints to show\
true love to one another.\
4:23\
Jesus extends the same\
kind of invitation\
4:26\
to us that He did to Zacchaeus:\
"Behold, I stand at the door,\
4:30\
and knock: if [you] hear my\
voice, and open the door,\
4:34\
I will come in to [you],\
and will sup with [you],\
4:38\
and [you] with me."\
4:39\
Christ sees us in our tree.\
4:44\
Some of us are splintering\
with questions.\
4:47\
Not many years ago,\
I was weighed down\
4:49\
and irritated with questions\
that I could not find answers\
4:53\
to.\
4:53\
Early one Saturday morning\
I had a little dream.\
4:57\
In the dream I\
could see a gazebo,\
5:00\
and I understood that I\
should go stand in it.\
5:03\
It had five arches\
encircling it,\
5:05\
but the windows were\
made out of stone.\
5:08\
I complained in the dream,\
not wanting to go inside\
5:11\
because it was claustrophobic.\
5:13\
But the thought came into my\
mind that the Brother of Jared\
5:17\
had patiently melted\
stones into clear glass.\
5:20\
Glass is a stone that has\
undergone a state change.\
5:24\
When the Lord touched the\
brother of Jared's stones,\
5:27\
they glowed with\
light, and suddenly I\
5:31\
was filled with a desire\
to be in that gazebo more\
5:34\
than any other place.\
5:36\
It was the very place--the only\
place--for me to truly "see."\
5:41\
The questions that were\
bothering me didn't go away,\
5:44\
but more brightly in my mind was\
the question after I woke up:\
5:48\
"How are you going to\
increase your faith,\
5:51\
like the brother of Jared,\
so that your stones can\
5:54\
be turned into light?"\
5:57\
Our mortal brains are made to\
seek understanding and meaning\
6:00\
in tidy bundles.\
6:02\
I don't know all the reasons\
why the veil over mortality\
6:06\
is so thick.\
6:07\
This is not the stage in\
our eternal development\
6:10\
where we have all the answers.\
6:11\
But it is the stage where\
we develop our assurance\
6:15\
(or sometimes our hope) in the\
evidence of things not seen.\
6:19\
Assurance comes in ways that\
aren't always easy to analyze,\
6:23\
but there is light\
in our darkness.\
6:26\
Jesus said, "I am the\
light, and the life,\
6:30\
and the truth of the world."\
6:33\
For those seeking truth,\
it may seem at first\
6:36\
to be the foolish claustrophobia\
of windows made out of stone.\
6:40\
But with patience and\
faithful questions,\
6:43\
Jesus can transform our windows\
of stone to glass and light.\
6:48\
Christ is light to see.\
6:52\
Some of us feel we can\
never be good enough.\
6:55\
The scarlet dye of\
the Old Testament\
6:58\
was not only colorful,\
but it was colorfast,\
7:02\
meaning that its vivid\
color stuck to the wool\
7:05\
and would not fade no matter\
how many times it was washed.\
7:08\
Satan wields that\
reasoning like a club:\
7:12\
white wool stained scarlet can\
never go back to being white.\
7:17\
But Jesus Christ\
declares, "My ways [are]\
7:20\
higher than your ways," and\
the miracle of His grace\
7:24\
is that when we\
repent of our sins,\
7:26\
His scarlet blood\
returns us to purity.\
7:30\
It isn't logical, but\
it is nevertheless true.\
7:34\
"Though your sins be as\
scarlet, they shall be ...\
7:37\
white as snow; though\
they be red like crimson,\
7:40\
they shall be as wool."\
7:42\
The Lord says\
emphatically: he or she\
7:45\
"who has repented of [sin],\
the same is forgiven,\
7:49\
and I, the Lord,\
remember them no more."\
7:52\
In essence: Come, let\
us reason together.\
7:56\
You made mistakes,\
and all come short.\
7:59\
Come unto me and repent.\
8:01\
I will remember the sin no more.\
8:04\
You can be whole again.\
8:06\
I have a work for you to do.\
8:08\
Christ is wool made white.\
8:13\
But what are the\
practical steps?\
8:15\
What is the key to reconnecting\
to the power of Jesus Christ\
8:18\
when we are flickering?\
8:20\
President Nelson\
said it very simply:\
8:23\
"The key is to make and\
keep sacred covenants.\
8:26\
...\
8:26\
It is not a complicated way."\
8:28\
Make Christ the\
center of your life.\
8:32\
If you feel that the beacon of\
your testimony is sputtering\
8:36\
and darkness is closing\
in, take courage.\
8:40\
Keep your promises to God.\
8:42\
Ask your questions.\
8:44\
Patiently melt stone to glass.\
8:46\
Turn to Jesus Christ,\
who loves you still.\
8:50\
Jesus said, "I am the light\
[that] shineth in darkness,\
8:54\
and the darkness\
comprehendeth it not."\
8:57\
That means no matter\
how hard it tries,\
9:00\
the darkness cannot\
put out that light.\
9:03\
Ever.\
9:04\
You can trust that His\
light will be there for you.\
9:09\
We, or people we love,\
may temporarily go dark.\
9:12\
In the case of the\
Salt Lake Temple,\
9:14\
the facility manager,\
Brother Val White,\
9:16\
got a call almost immediately.\
9:18\
People had noticed.\
9:20\
What was wrong with\
the temple lights?\
9:22\
First, the staff went in person\
to every electrical panel\
9:25\
in the temple, and they manually\
turned the lights back on.\
9:29\
Then they replaced the batteries\
in the automatic power supply\
9:32\
and tested them to find\
out what had failed.\
9:36\
It's hard to get the\
lights back on by yourself.\
9:38\
We need friends.\
9:40\
We need each other.\
9:41\
Just like the temple\
facility staff,\
9:43\
we can help each other\
by showing up in person,\
9:46\
recharging our\
spiritual batteries,\
9:48\
repairing what went wrong.\
9:50\
Like Temple Square\
at Christmastime,\
9:52\
we may only be one\
light bulb on a tree.\
9:55\
But we still shine\
our small light,\
9:58\
and all together we\
attract millions of people\
10:01\
to the house of the Lord.\
10:02\
Best of all, as President\
Nelson has encouraged,\
10:05\
we can bring the Savior's\
light to ourselves\
10:08\
and to people that\
are important to us\
10:10\
by the simple act of\
keeping our covenants.\
10:13\
In a variety of ways, the\
Lord rewards that faithful act\
10:16\
with power and with joy.\
10:20\
I testify you are beloved.\
10:23\
The Lord knows how\
hard you are trying.\
10:26\
You are making progress.\
10:28\
Keep going.\
10:30\
He sees all your\
hidden sacrifices\
10:32\
and counts them to your good\
and the good of those you love.\
10:36\
Your work is not in vain.\
10:38\
You are not alone.\
10:40\
His very name, Emmanuel,\
means "God with us."\
10:45\
He is surely with you.\
10:48\
Take a few more steps\
on the covenant path,\
10:50\
even if it's too\
dark to see very far.\
10:52\
The lights will come back on.\
10:54\
I testify of the truth\
in Jesus's words,\
10:57\
and they are filled with\
light: "Draw near unto\
11:00\
me and I will draw\
near unto you; seek me\
11:04\
diligently and ye\
shall find me; ask,\
11:07\
and ye shall receive; knock, and\
it shall be opened unto you."\
11:11\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
