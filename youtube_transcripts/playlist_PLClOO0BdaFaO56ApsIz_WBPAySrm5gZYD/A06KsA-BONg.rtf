The programs and\
activities of The Church\
0:03\
of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints\
0:05\
are becoming ever\
more home centered\
0:08\
and Church supported,\
as evidenced\
0:10\
by the series of\
adjustments announced\
0:13\
in recent general conferences.\
0:15\
President Russell M. Nelson\
has counseled all of us:\
0:20\
"There is much more to come. ...\
0:22\
Eat your vitamin pills.\
0:25\
Get your rest.\
0:26\
It's going to be exciting."\
0:31\
I pray for and invite the\
help of the Holy Ghost\
0:34\
as we consider together\
several basic implications\
0:39\
of these ongoing adjustments\
in the Lord's restored Church.\
0:45\
Elder Craig C. Christensen\
and I were companions recently\
0:48\
in a priesthood\
leadership conference,\
0:50\
and he used two simple\
questions to emphasize\
0:54\
the principle of becoming home\
centered and Church supported.\
0:59\
He suggested that instead\
of returning to our homes\
1:03\
after Church meetings on Sunday\
and asking, "What did you\
1:07\
learn about the Savior and\
His gospel at church today?"\
1:11\
we should ask in\
our Church meetings,\
1:14\
"What did you learn about the\
Savior and His gospel this week\
1:18\
in your home?"\
1:20\
Proper Sabbath-day observance,\
the new curriculum,\
1:24\
and the adjusted\
meeting schedule\
1:26\
all help us to learn the\
gospel both in our homes\
1:31\
and at church.\
1:34\
Each member of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
1:37\
Saints has an individual\
responsibility\
1:41\
to learn and live\
the Lord's teachings\
1:44\
and to receive by\
proper authority\
1:46\
the ordinances of\
salvation and exaltation.\
1:50\
We should not expect the\
Church as an organization\
1:54\
to teach or tell\
us everything we\
1:57\
need to know and do to\
become devoted disciples\
2:01\
and endure valiantly to the end.\
2:04\
Rather, our personal\
responsibility\
2:08\
is to learn what\
we should learn,\
2:11\
to live as we know\
we should live,\
2:14\
and to become who the\
Master would have us become.\
2:18\
And our homes are the ultimate\
setting for learning, living,\
2:24\
and becoming.\
2:27\
As a child, Joseph Smith\
learned of God from his family.\
2:30\
His efforts to discover\
God's will for him\
2:33\
caused Joseph to\
search for the truth\
2:36\
among many different\
Christian denominations,\
2:39\
ponder diligently\
the scriptures,\
2:42\
and pray sincerely to God.\
2:45\
As young Joseph returned to\
his home from the Sacred Grove\
2:49\
immediately after the appearance\
of the Father and the Son,\
2:52\
he spoke first with his mother.\
2:55\
As he "leaned up to\
the fireplace, [his]\
2:58\
mother inquired\
what the matter was.\
3:00\
[Joseph] replied, 'Never mind,\
all is well--I am well enough\
3:06\
off.'\
3:06\
[He] then said to [his]\
mother, 'I have learned\
3:11\
for myself.'" Joseph's\
experience provides a powerful\
3:17\
pattern of learning that\
each of us should emulate.\
3:21\
We too need to\
learn for ourselves.\
3:27\
The overarching purpose\
of Heavenly Father's plan\
3:30\
is for His children to\
become more like Him.\
3:33\
Accordingly, He provides us\
with essential opportunities\
3:37\
to grow and progress.\
3:39\
Our commitment to live and\
learn according to truth\
3:44\
is increasingly important in\
a world that is "in commotion"\
3:48\
and is ever more\
confused and wicked.\
3:51\
We cannot expect simply\
to attend Church meetings\
3:57\
and participate in programs\
and thereby receive all\
4:01\
of the spiritual edification and\
protection that will enable us\
4:05\
"to withstand in the evil day."\
4:09\
"Parents have a sacred\
duty to rear their children\
4:12\
in love and righteousness."\
4:14\
Inspired leaders,\
teachers, and activities\
4:17\
help individual and family\
efforts to grow spiritually.\
4:21\
And though we all need\
help pressing forward\
4:24\
on the covenant path, the\
ultimate responsibility\
4:28\
for developing spiritual\
strength and stamina\
4:31\
rests upon each one of us.\
4:36\
Recall how Nephi, son\
of the prophet Lehi,\
4:39\
desired to see, hear,\
and know for himself\
4:45\
by the power of the\
Holy Ghost the things\
4:47\
his father had learned in the\
vision of the tree of life.\
4:50\
Nephi clearly needed and\
was blessed in his youth\
4:55\
by the example and teachings\
of his "goodly parents."\
4:59\
Yet just like Joseph\
Smith, he yearned\
5:03\
to learn and know for himself.\
5:08\
If all you or I know\
about Jesus Christ\
5:11\
and His restored gospel is what\
other people teach or tell us,\
5:17\
then the foundation\
of our testimony\
5:20\
of Him and His glorious\
latter-day work\
5:24\
is built upon sand.\
5:26\
We cannot rely exclusively\
upon or borrow gospel light\
5:31\
and knowledge from other\
people--even those whom we love\
5:35\
and trust.\
5:38\
Significantly, the\
Prophet Joseph Smith\
5:40\
taught that each\
Latter-day Saint needs\
5:44\
to understand for\
himself or herself\
5:47\
"the designs and purposes of God\
in our coming into the world."\
5:54\
"Could we read\
and comprehend all\
5:58\
that has been written\
from the days of Adam,\
6:01\
on the relation of man to God\
and angels in a future state,\
6:06\
we should know very\
little about it.\
6:10\
Reading the experiences of\
others, or the revelation given\
6:15\
to them, can never give\
us a comprehensive view\
6:19\
of our condition and\
true relation to God.\
6:23\
Knowledge of these\
things can only\
6:27\
be obtained by experience\
through the ordinances of God\
6:32\
set forth for that purpose."\
6:37\
Enabling the accomplishment of\
this grand spiritual objective\
6:41\
for individuals and families is\
one of the fundamental reasons\
6:46\
the programs and\
activities of The Church\
6:49\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints are becoming more home\
6:53\
centered and Church supported\
in this specific season\
6:58\
of the dispensation of\
the fulness of times.\
7:04\
Let me summarize a few basic\
implications of gospel learning\
7:08\
becoming increasingly home\
centered and Church supported.\
7:14\
The ultimate missionary\
training center is in our homes;\
7:18\
secondary missionary\
training centers\
7:21\
are located in Provo,\
Manila, Mexico City,\
7:25\
and in other locations.\
7:27\
Our most instructive\
Sunday School classes\
7:31\
should be our individual\
and family study\
7:34\
in our places of residence;\
helpful but secondary Sunday\
7:38\
School classes are held\
in our meetinghouses.\
7:43\
Family history centers\
now are in our homes.\
7:47\
Supplemental support for our\
family history research work\
7:50\
also is available in\
our meetinghouses.\
7:55\
Vital temple preparation\
classes occur in our homes;\
8:00\
important but secondary temple\
preparation classes also\
8:05\
may be conducted periodically\
in our meetinghouses.\
8:10\
Making our homes\
sanctuaries wherein\
8:14\
we can "stand in holy places" is\
essential in these latter days.\
8:19\
And as important as\
home-centered and\
8:23\
Church-supported learning is\
for our spiritual strength\
8:26\
and protection today, it will be\
even more vital in the future.\
8:33\
Please consider\
how the principle\
8:35\
of "home centered\
and Church supported"\
8:38\
applies to our individual\
preparation and worthiness\
8:42\
to receive sacred\
ordinances and covenants\
8:45\
in the house of the Lord.\
8:49\
Indeed, temple preparation is\
most effective in our homes.\
8:53\
But many Church members\
are unsure about what they\
8:58\
appropriately can and cannot say\
regarding the temple experience\
9:03\
outside of the temple.\
9:06\
President Ezra Taft\
Benson described\
9:08\
why this uncertainty exists.\
9:13\
"The temple is a sacred\
place, and the ordinances\
9:16\
in the temple are of\
a sacred character.\
9:19\
Because of its sacredness\
we are sometimes\
9:22\
reluctant to say\
anything about the temple\
9:25\
to our children\
and grandchildren.\
9:28\
"As a consequence, many do\
not develop a real desire\
9:32\
to go to the temple,\
or when they go there,\
9:35\
they do so without\
much background\
9:36\
to prepare them\
for the obligations\
9:39\
and covenants they enter into."\
9:42\
President Benson continues: "I\
believe a proper understanding\
9:48\
or background will immeasurably\
help prepare our youth\
9:52\
for the temple ...\
9:53\
[and] will foster\
within them a desire\
9:56\
to seek their priesthood\
blessings just\
9:59\
as Abraham sought his."\
10:04\
Two basic guidelines\
can help us achieve\
10:08\
the proper understanding\
emphasized by President Benson.\
10:13\
Guideline #1.\
10:15\
Because we love\
the Lord, we always\
10:19\
should speak about His\
holy house with reverence.\
10:24\
We should not\
disclose or describe\
10:28\
the special symbols associated\
with the covenants we receive\
10:32\
in sacred temple ceremonies.\
10:35\
Neither should we discuss\
the holy information\
10:38\
that we specifically promise\
in the temple not to reveal.\
10:45\
Guideline #2.\
10:46\
The temple is the\
house of the Lord.\
10:51\
Everything in the temple points\
us to our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
10:56\
We may discuss the basic\
purposes for and the doctrine\
11:03\
of and principles associated\
with temple ordinances\
11:07\
and covenants.\
11:09\
President Howard W.\
Hunter counseled:\
11:12\
"Let us share with our\
children the spiritual feelings\
11:16\
we have in the temple.\
11:17\
And let us teach them more\
earnestly and more comfortably\
11:22\
the things we can appropriately\
say about the purposes\
11:26\
of the house of the Lord."\
11:28\
Now, brothers and sisters,\
across the generations\
11:33\
from the Prophet Joseph Smith\
to President Russell M. Nelson,\
11:37\
the doctrinal purposes of\
temple ordinances and covenants\
11:42\
have been taught extensively\
by Church leaders.\
11:46\
A rich reservoir of resources\
exists in print, audio, video,\
11:53\
and other formats to\
help us learn about\
11:56\
initiatory ordinances,\
endowments, marriages,\
12:01\
and other sealing ordinances.\
12:04\
Information also is available\
about following the Savior\
12:08\
by receiving and\
honoring covenants\
12:11\
to keep the law of obedience,\
the law of sacrifice,\
12:15\
the law of the gospel,\
the law of chastity,\
12:18\
and the law of consecration.\
12:21\
All Church members\
should become familiar\
12:23\
with the excellent\
materials available\
12:26\
at\
temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\
12:33\
President Russell M. Nelson\
emphasized the vital balance\
12:36\
between the sacred nature\
of temple ceremonies\
12:40\
and the valuable information\
about temples published\
12:44\
by the Church that is\
accurate, appropriate,\
12:47\
and available publicly.\
12:49\
He explained: "I\
recommend that members ...\
12:53\
read the entries in the Bible\
Dictionary that are related\
12:57\
to the temple, such as 'Anoint,'\
'Covenant,' 'Sacrifices,' and\
13:03\
'Temple.'\
13:04\
One may also wish to read Exodus\
chapters 26-29 and Leviticus\
13:10\
chapter 8.\
13:11\
The Old Testament, as well as\
the books of Moses and Abraham\
13:16\
in the Pearl of Great\
Price, underscores\
13:19\
the antiquity of temple\
work and the enduring nature\
13:23\
of its ordinances."\
13:28\
So imagine that\
your son or daughter\
13:29\
asks, "Someone at school told\
me that strange clothing is\
13:34\
worn in the temple.\
13:35\
Is that right?"\
13:37\
A short video is available on\
temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\
13:44\
entitled "Sacred\
Temple Clothing."\
13:47\
This excellent resource\
explains how from ancient times\
13:52\
men and women have embraced\
sacred music, different forms\
13:56\
of prayer, symbolic\
religious clothing, gestures,\
14:01\
and rituals to express their\
innermost feelings of devotion\
14:05\
to God.\
14:06\
Thus, the Church supports\
home-centered preparation\
14:11\
for the glorious\
blessings of the temple\
14:14\
through basic instruction\
and remarkable resources\
14:18\
such as this video.\
14:20\
Much useful information is\
available for all of us.\
14:28\
As we strive to walk in the\
meekness of the Lord's Spirit,\
14:31\
we will be blessed to understand\
and achieve in our homes\
14:36\
the necessary balance\
between what is\
14:39\
and what is not appropriate\
to discuss about sacred temple\
14:42\
ordinances and covenants.\
14:47\
I suspect that some of\
you may be wondering\
14:49\
if your gospel learning actually\
can become home centered\
14:54\
and Church supported.\
14:56\
Perhaps you are the only member\
of the Church in your home,\
15:00\
or have an unsupportive\
spouse, or are a single parent,\
15:05\
or live alone as a single or\
divorced Latter-day Saint,\
15:09\
and you may have\
questions about how\
15:11\
these principles apply to you.\
15:13\
You may be a husband and a\
wife looking at each other\
15:17\
and questioning,\
"Can we do this?"\
15:21\
Yes, you can do this!\
15:24\
I promise that\
enabling blessings\
15:27\
will flow into and be\
evident in your lives.\
15:32\
Doors will open.\
15:35\
The light will shine.\
15:38\
Your capacity will be\
increased to persevere\
15:41\
diligently and patiently.\
15:46\
I joyfully witness that\
compensating blessings\
15:48\
will come as we\
strive to fulfill\
15:51\
our individual responsibility\
to learn and love the restored\
15:56\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
15:59\
We truly can "be prepared to\
obtain every needful thing."\
16:05\
I so promise and testify\
in the sacred name\
16:09\
of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
