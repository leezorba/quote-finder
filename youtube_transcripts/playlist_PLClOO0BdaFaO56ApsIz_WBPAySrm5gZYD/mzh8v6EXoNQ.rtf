My dear brothers and\
sisters, our Heavenly Father\
0:05\
and Jesus Christ desire\
to bless each of us.\
0:09\
The question of how to access\
and obtain those blessings\
0:13\
has been the subject\
of theological debate\
0:16\
and discussion for centuries.\
0:18\
Some contend that blessings\
are completely earned;\
0:23\
we receive them only\
through our works.\
0:26\
Others argue that God has\
already chosen who He will\
0:30\
bless and how--and that\
these determinations are\
0:34\
unchangeable.\
0:35\
Both positions are\
fundamentally flawed.\
0:39\
Blessings from\
heaven are neither\
0:42\
earned by frenetically\
accruing "good deed coupons,"\
0:45\
nor by helplessly waiting to see\
if we win the blessing lottery.\
0:51\
No, the truth is much more\
nuanced but more appropriate\
0:56\
for the relationship between a\
loving Heavenly Father and His\
0:59\
potential heirs--us.\
1:03\
Restored truth reveals that\
blessings are never earned,\
1:07\
but faith-inspired\
actions on our part,\
1:10\
both initial and\
ongoing, are essential.\
1:15\
As we consider how we\
receive blessings from God,\
1:19\
let us liken heavenly blessings\
to a massive pile of wood.\
1:24\
Imagine at the center a\
small mound of kindling,\
1:27\
topped by a layer of wood chips.\
1:30\
Sticks come next, then small\
logs, and finally huge logs.\
1:36\
This woodpile contains an\
enormous amount of fuel,\
1:40\
capable of producing\
light and heat for days.\
1:44\
Envision next to the woodpile\
a single match, the kind\
1:50\
with a phosphorus tip.\
1:52\
For the energy in the\
woodpile to be released,\
1:55\
the match needs to be\
struck and the kindling lit.\
1:59\
The kindling will quickly\
catch fire and cause the larger\
2:03\
pieces of wood to burn.\
2:06\
Once this combustion\
reaction starts,\
2:09\
it continues until\
all the wood is burned\
2:12\
or the fire is\
deprived of oxygen.\
2:16\
Striking the match and\
lighting the kindling\
2:19\
are small actions that\
enable the potential energy\
2:23\
of the wood to be released.\
2:25\
Until the match\
is struck, nothing\
2:28\
happens, regardless of\
the size of the wood pile.\
2:31\
If the match is struck but\
not applied to the kindling,\
2:35\
the amount of light and\
heat released from the match\
2:38\
alone is minuscule and the\
combustion energy in the wood\
2:42\
remains unreleased.\
2:44\
If oxygen is not\
supplied at any point,\
2:48\
the combustion reaction stops.\
2:52\
In a similar way, most blessings\
that God desires to give us\
2:57\
require action on our\
part--action based on our faith\
3:01\
in Jesus Christ.\
3:03\
Faith in the Savior is\
a principle of action\
3:07\
and of power.\
3:08\
First we act in faith; then\
the power comes--according\
3:14\
to God's will and timing.\
3:16\
The sequence is crucial.\
3:19\
The required action,\
though, is always tiny\
3:23\
when compared to the blessings\
we ultimately receive.\
3:28\
Consider what happened when\
fiery, flying serpents came\
3:32\
among the ancient Israelites on\
their way to the promised land.\
3:36\
The bite of the poisonous\
serpent was fatal.\
3:40\
But a bitten individual\
could be healed\
3:43\
by looking at a brass\
serpent fashioned by Moses\
3:47\
and placed on a pole.\
3:49\
How much energy does it\
take to look at something?\
3:53\
All who looked accessed\
the powers of heaven\
3:56\
and were healed.\
3:57\
Other Israelites who\
were bitten failed\
4:01\
to look at the brazen\
serpent and died.\
4:04\
Perhaps they lacked\
the faith to look.\
4:08\
Perhaps they did not believe\
that such a simple action could\
4:12\
trigger the promised healing.\
4:14\
Or perhaps they willfully\
hardened their hearts\
4:18\
and rejected the counsel\
of God's prophet.\
4:23\
The principle of activating\
blessings that flow from God\
4:26\
is eternal.\
4:27\
Like those ancient\
Israelites, we too\
4:31\
must act on our faith in\
Jesus Christ to be blessed.\
4:35\
God has revealed\
that "there is a law,\
4:39\
irrevocably decreed in heaven\
before the foundations of this\
4:43\
world, upon which all blessings\
are predicated--and when we\
4:47\
obtain any blessing from God,\
it is by obedience to that law\
4:52\
upon which it is predicated."\
4:55\
That being said, you do not\
earn a blessing--that notion is\
5:00\
false--but you do have\
to qualify for it.\
5:04\
Our salvation comes only\
through the merits and grace\
5:08\
of Jesus Christ.\
5:09\
The immensity of His\
atoning sacrifice\
5:13\
means that the\
woodpile is infinite;\
5:16\
our puny actions approach\
zero in comparison.\
5:21\
But they are not zero, and\
they are not insignificant;\
5:25\
in the dark, a match that is\
lit can be seen for miles.\
5:31\
In fact, it can\
be seen in heaven,\
5:34\
because small acts\
of faith are required\
5:37\
to ignite God's promises.\
5:41\
To receive a desired\
blessing from God,\
5:43\
act with faith, striking\
the metaphorical match\
5:47\
on which the heavenly\
blessing is contingent.\
5:50\
For example, one of\
the objects of prayer\
5:53\
is to secure blessings that\
God is willing to grant\
5:57\
but that are made\
conditional on our asking.\
6:00\
Alma cried out for mercy,\
and his pains resolved;\
6:06\
he was no longer harrowed up\
by the memory of his sins.\
6:10\
His joy overwhelmed his\
pain--all because he cried out\
6:16\
with faith in Jesus Christ.\
6:18\
The activation\
energy needed for us\
6:21\
is to have enough faith\
in Christ to sincerely ask\
6:26\
God in prayer and accept His\
will and timing for the answer.\
6:32\
Often the activation\
energy needed\
6:34\
for blessings requires more\
than just looking or asking;\
6:39\
ongoing, repeated, faith-filled\
actions are required.\
6:44\
In the middle of\
the 19th century,\
6:47\
Brigham Young directed a\
group of Latter-day Saints\
6:50\
to explore and settle Arizona,\
an arid region in North\
6:54\
America.\
6:56\
After reaching Arizona,\
the group ran out of water\
7:00\
and feared they would perish.\
7:02\
They pled with God for help.\
7:04\
Soon rain and snow\
fell, allowing\
7:08\
them to fill their\
barrels with water\
7:10\
and provide for their livestock.\
7:12\
Grateful and refreshed,\
they returned\
7:15\
to Salt Lake City rejoicing\
in the goodness of God.\
7:19\
Upon their return, they reported\
the details of their expedition\
7:24\
to Brigham Young and\
pronounced their conclusion\
7:27\
that Arizona was uninhabitable.\
7:32\
After listening to the\
report, Brigham Young\
7:35\
asked a man in the room what\
he thought about the expedition\
7:38\
and the miracle.\
7:40\
That man, Daniel W.\
Jones, tersely replied,\
7:45\
"I would have filled up,\
went on, and prayed again."\
7:50\
Brother Brigham put his\
hand on Brother Jones\
7:54\
and said, "This is the\
man that shall take charge\
7:58\
of the next trip to Arizona."\
8:01\
We can all recall times when\
we have pushed on and prayed\
8:05\
again--and blessings resulted.\
8:08\
The experiences of\
Michael and Marian Holmes\
8:12\
illustrate these principles.\
8:14\
Michael and I served\
together as Area Seventies.\
8:18\
I was always thrilled\
whenever he was called on\
8:22\
to pray in our meetings because\
his deep spirituality was\
8:27\
readily apparent; he knew\
how to speak with God.\
8:31\
I loved to hear him pray.\
8:35\
Early in their marriage,\
though, Michael and Marian\
8:38\
were not praying or\
attending church.\
8:41\
They were busy with\
three little children\
8:43\
and a successful\
construction company.\
8:46\
Michael did not feel that\
he was a religious man.\
8:50\
One evening their bishop\
came to their home\
8:53\
and encouraged them\
to begin praying.\
8:57\
After the bishop left,\
Michael and Marian\
8:59\
decided that they\
would try to pray.\
9:02\
Before going to bed, they\
knelt at their bedside,\
9:06\
and, uncomfortably,\
Michael began.\
9:09\
After a few awkward\
words of prayer,\
9:12\
Michael abruptly stopped,\
saying, "Marian, I\
9:16\
can't do this."\
9:18\
As he stood and\
began walking away,\
9:20\
Marian grabbed him by the hand,\
dragged him back to his knees,\
9:25\
and said, "Mike,\
you can do this.\
9:28\
Try again!"\
9:29\
With this encouragement,\
Michael finished a short prayer.\
9:35\
The Holmeses began\
to pray regularly.\
9:37\
They accepted a neighbor's\
invitation to attend church.\
9:41\
As they walked into the chapel\
and heard the opening hymn,\
9:46\
the Spirit whispered to\
them, "This is true."\
9:50\
Later, unseen and unasked,\
Michael hauled some\
9:55\
trash from the meetinghouse.\
9:57\
As he did, he felt a distinct\
impression: "This is My house."\
10:05\
Michael and Marian accepted\
Church callings and served\
10:08\
in their ward and stake.\
10:10\
They were sealed to each\
other and their 3 children.\
10:13\
More children followed,\
bringing the total to 12.\
10:18\
The Holmes served as mission\
president and companion--twice.\
10:25\
The first clunky prayer was a\
small but faith-filled action\
10:30\
that triggered the\
blessings of heaven.\
10:33\
The Holmeses fed\
the flames of faith\
10:36\
by attending church and serving.\
10:39\
Their dedicated\
discipleship over the years\
10:42\
has led to a raging inferno\
that inspires to this day.\
10:50\
A fire, however, must receive\
a constant supply of oxygen\
10:54\
for the wood to ultimately\
release its full potential.\
10:58\
As demonstrated by Michael and\
Marian Holmes, faith in Christ\
11:03\
requires ongoing action\
for the blaze to continue.\
11:07\
Small actions fuel our ability\
to walk along the covenant path\
11:13\
and lead to the greatest\
blessings God can offer.\
11:17\
But oxygen flows only\
if we figuratively\
11:21\
keep moving our feet.\
11:23\
Sometimes we need to\
make a bow and arrow\
11:27\
before revelation\
comes as to where\
11:29\
we should search for food.\
11:31\
Sometimes we need to make\
tools before revelations\
11:37\
come as to how to build a ship.\
11:39\
Sometimes, at the direction\
of the Lord's prophet,\
11:44\
we need to bake a small\
cake from the little oil\
11:48\
and flour we have to receive\
an unfailing cruse of oil\
11:52\
and barrel of flour.\
11:54\
And sometimes we need to "be\
still and know that [God is]\
12:00\
God" and trust in His timing.\
12:04\
When you receive any\
blessing from God,\
12:07\
you can conclude that\
you have complied\
12:11\
with an eternal law governing\
reception of that blessing.\
12:15\
But remember that the\
"irrevocably decreed" law\
12:18\
is time-insensitive,\
meaning blessings\
12:22\
come on God's timetable.\
12:24\
Even ancient prophets, in\
search of their heavenly home,\
12:29\
"died in faith, not having\
received the promises,\
12:33\
but having seen them afar\
off ... were persuaded ...\
12:36\
and embraced them."\
12:38\
If a desired blessing from God\
has not been received--yet--you\
12:43\
do not need to go crazy,\
wondering what more you need\
12:48\
to do.\
12:49\
Instead, heed Joseph Smith's\
counsel to "cheerfully do all\
12:53\
things that lie in [your]\
power; and then ... stand still,\
12:57\
with the utmost assurance, to\
see the ... arm [of God] ...\
13:01\
revealed."\
13:03\
Some blessings are\
reserved for later, even\
13:07\
for the most valiant\
of God's children.\
13:11\
Six months ago, a home-centered,\
Church-supported plan\
13:15\
to learn doctrine, strengthen\
faith, and fortify individuals\
13:19\
and families was introduced.\
13:21\
President Russell\
M. Nelson promised\
13:23\
that the changes can help us\
survive spiritually, increase\
13:28\
our gospel joy, and deepen\
our conversion to Heavenly\
13:32\
Father and Jesus Christ.\
13:34\
But it is up to us to\
claim these blessings.\
13:38\
We are each responsible\
to open and study Come,\
13:42\
Follow Me--For\
Individuals and Families,\
13:44\
along with the scriptures and\
other Come, Follow Me material.\
13:48\
We need to discuss them\
with our family and friends\
13:51\
and organize our Sabbath day\
to light a metaphorical fire.\
13:56\
Or we can leave the resources\
sitting in a pile in our homes\
14:01\
with the potential\
energy trapped inside.\
14:06\
I invite you to\
faithfully activate\
14:10\
heavenly power to receive\
specific blessings from God.\
14:14\
Exercise the faith to strike\
the match and light the fire.\
14:20\
Supply the needed oxygen while\
you patiently wait on the Lord.\
14:25\
With these invitations, I\
pray that the Holy Ghost\
14:29\
will guide and direct\
you so that you,\
14:32\
like the faithful person\
described in Proverbs,\
14:36\
will "abound with blessings."\
14:38\
I testify that your Heavenly\
Father and His Beloved\
14:42\
Son, Jesus Christ, live, are\
concerned with your welfare,\
14:47\
and delight to bless you, in\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
