An important and\
comforting doctrine\
0:04\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ\
is that our Heavenly Father has\
0:07\
perfect love for His children.\
0:09\
Because of that perfect\
love, He blesses\
0:12\
us not only according to our\
desires and needs but also\
0:15\
according to His\
infinite wisdom.\
0:17\
As simply stated by\
the prophet Nephi,\
0:20\
"I know that [God]\
loveth his children."\
0:24\
One aspect of that perfect\
love is our Heavenly Father's\
0:27\
involvement in the\
details of our lives,\
0:29\
even when we may not be\
aware of it or understand it.\
0:33\
We seek the Father's\
divine guidance\
0:35\
and help through\
heartfelt, earnest prayer.\
0:38\
When we honor our\
covenants and strive\
0:41\
to be more like\
our Savior, we are\
0:43\
entitled to a constant\
stream of divine guidance\
0:46\
through the influence and\
inspiration of the Holy Ghost.\
0:51\
THE SCRIPTURES TEACH US:\
"For your Father knoweth\
0:53\
what things ye have need\
of, before ye ask him,"\
0:56\
and He "knoweth\
all things, for all\
0:59\
things are present\
before [His] eyes."\
1:03\
The prophet Mormon is\
an example of this.\
1:05\
He did not live to see\
the results of his work.\
1:08\
Yet he understood that\
the Lord was carefully\
1:10\
leading him along.\
1:11\
When he felt inspired to include\
the small plates of Nephi\
1:15\
with his record,\
Mormon wrote: "And I\
1:18\
do this for a wise purpose;\
for thus it whispereth me,\
1:21\
according to the workings\
of the Spirit of the Lord\
1:23\
which is in me.\
1:24\
And now, I do not\
know all things;\
1:27\
but the Lord knoweth all\
things which are to come;\
1:30\
wherefore, he worketh in me\
to do according to his will."\
1:34\
Although Mormon did not\
know of the future loss\
1:38\
of the 116 manuscript\
pages, the Lord\
1:40\
did and prepared a way to\
overcome that obstacle long\
1:44\
before it occurred.\
1:46\
The Father is aware of\
us, knows our needs,\
1:48\
and will help us perfectly.\
1:50\
Sometimes that help is\
given in the very moment\
1:53\
or at least soon after\
we ask for divine help.\
1:56\
Sometimes our most worthy\
and earnest desires\
1:59\
are not answered\
in the way we hope,\
2:01\
but we find that God has\
greater blessings in store.\
2:05\
And sometimes our\
righteous desires\
2:07\
are not granted in this life.\
2:09\
I will illustrate through\
three different accounts\
2:12\
the ways our Father\
in Heaven may answer\
2:14\
our earnest petitions to Him.\
2:17\
Our youngest son was called\
to serve as a missionary\
2:19\
in the France Paris Mission.\
2:21\
In preparation to\
serve, we went with him\
2:24\
to purchase the usual\
shirts, suits, ties, socks,\
2:27\
and an overcoat.\
2:29\
Unfortunately, the\
overcoat he wanted\
2:31\
was not immediately in\
stock in the size he needed.\
2:34\
However, the store\
clerk indicated\
2:36\
that the coat would become\
available in a few weeks\
2:39\
and would be delivered to\
the missionary training\
2:41\
center in Provo prior to our\
son's departure for France.\
2:45\
We paid for the coat and\
thought nothing more of it.\
2:49\
Our son entered the missionary\
training center in June,\
2:51\
and the overcoat was delivered\
just days before his scheduled\
2:54\
departure in August.\
2:56\
He did not try on the\
coat but hurriedly\
2:58\
packed it in his luggage with\
his other clothing and items.\
3:03\
As winter approached in Paris,\
where our son was serving,\
3:06\
he wrote to us that he had\
pulled out the overcoat,\
3:08\
tried it on, but found\
that it was far too small.\
3:11\
We therefore had to deposit\
extra funds in his bank account\
3:14\
so that he could buy another\
coat in Paris, which he did.\
3:18\
With some irritation,\
I wrote to him\
3:20\
and told him to give the\
first coat away inasmuch\
3:23\
as he couldn't use it.\
3:25\
We later received\
this email from him:\
3:33\
"It is very, very cold here. ...\
3:36\
The wind seems to\
go right through us,\
3:38\
although my new coat is\
great and quite heavy.\
3:40\
...\
3:41\
I gave my old one to [another\
missionary in our apartment]\
3:43\
who said that he had\
been praying for a way\
3:46\
to get a better coat.\
3:47\
He is a convert of several years\
and he has only his mom ...\
3:52\
and the missionary who baptized\
him who are supporting him\
3:55\
on his mission and so the coat\
was an answer to a prayer,\
3:59\
so I felt very\
happy about that."\
4:02\
Heavenly Father knew\
that this missionary who\
4:04\
was serving in France some\
6,200 miles away from home\
4:07\
would urgently\
need a new overcoat\
4:09\
for a cold winter in Paris but\
that this missionary would not\
4:12\
have the means to buy one.\
4:14\
Heavenly Father also\
knew that our son\
4:16\
would receive from the\
clothing store in Provo, Utah,\
4:19\
an overcoat that would\
be far too small.\
4:22\
He knew that these\
two missionaries would\
4:23\
be serving together in Paris\
and that the coat would\
4:25\
be an answer to the humble and\
earnest prayer of a missionary\
4:29\
who had an immediate need.\
4:33\
THE SAVIOR TAUGHT: "Are not two\
sparrows sold for a farthing?\
4:36\
and one of them shall\
not fall on the ground\
4:38\
without your Father.\
4:39\
"But the very hairs of\
your head are all numbered.\
4:42\
"Fear ye not therefore,\
ye are of more value\
4:45\
than many sparrows."\
4:48\
In other situations, when\
our worthy desires are not\
4:50\
granted in the way\
we had hoped, it\
4:52\
may actually be for\
our ultimate benefit.\
4:55\
For example, Joseph\
was the son of Jacob,\
4:58\
and he was envied and hated\
by his brothers to the point\
5:01\
that they plotted\
Joseph's murder.\
5:03\
Instead, they sold him\
as a slave into Egypt.\
5:06\
If ever a person might have\
felt that his prayers were not\
5:09\
answered in the\
way he had hoped,\
5:11\
it could have been Joseph.\
5:12\
In reality, his\
apparent misfortune\
5:15\
resulted in great\
blessings to him\
5:16\
and saved his family\
from starvation.\
5:19\
Later, after having become\
a trusted leader in Egypt,\
5:22\
with great faith and wisdom,\
he said to his brothers:\
5:25\
"Now therefore be not grieved,\
nor angry with yourselves,\
5:28\
that ye sold me hither:\
for God did send me\
5:31\
before you to preserve life.\
5:33\
"For these two years hath\
the famine been in the land:\
5:36\
and yet there are five\
years, in the which\
5:38\
there shall neither\
be earing nor harvest.\
5:41\
"And God sent me\
before you to preserve\
5:43\
you a posterity in the\
earth, and to save your lives\
5:46\
by a great deliverance.\
5:47\
"So now it was not you that\
sent me hither, but God."\
5:52\
While in college,\
our oldest son was\
5:53\
hired into a very\
desirable part-time student\
5:55\
job that had the\
potential to lead\
5:57\
to a wonderful, permanent\
job after graduating.\
6:00\
He worked hard at this\
student job for four years,\
6:03\
became highly qualified, and was\
well respected by his coworkers\
6:06\
and supervisors.\
6:07\
At the end of his\
senior year, almost as\
6:09\
if orchestrated by heaven\
(at least to our son's\
6:12\
way of thinking), the\
permanent position did open up,\
6:15\
and he was the\
leading candidate,\
6:16\
with every indication and\
expectation that, indeed, he\
6:20\
would get the job.\
6:21\
Well, he was not hired.\
6:23\
None of us could understand it.\
6:25\
He had prepared well,\
interviewed well,\
6:27\
was the most\
qualified candidate,\
6:28\
and had prayed with great\
hope and expectation!\
6:31\
He was devastated and crushed,\
and the entire episode\
6:35\
left all of us\
scratching our heads.\
6:37\
Why had God abandoned him\
in his righteous desire?\
6:41\
It wasn't until several\
years later that the answer\
6:43\
became very clear.\
6:44\
Had he received the dream\
job after graduation,\
6:47\
he would have missed a critical\
life-changing opportunity\
6:50\
that has now proved to be\
for his eternal benefit\
6:53\
and blessing.\
6:54\
God knew the end from the\
beginning (as He always does),\
6:58\
and in this case, the answer\
to many righteous prayers\
7:01\
was no, in favor of a\
far superior outcome.\
7:06\
And sometimes the\
answer to prayer\
7:08\
that we so righteously,\
desperately, and earnestly seek\
7:11\
is not given in this life.\
7:15\
Sister Patricia Parkinson was\
born with normal eyesight,\
7:18\
but at age 7 she\
began to go blind.\
7:21\
At age 9, Pat began attending\
the Utah Schools for the Deaf\
7:25\
and Blind in Ogden, Utah,\
some 90 miles from her home,\
7:28\
necessitating her boarding at\
the school--which included all\
7:33\
of the homesickness that a\
9-year-old could possibly\
7:35\
experience.\
7:37\
By age 11 she had completely\
lost her eyesight.\
7:40\
Pat returned home\
permanently at age 15\
7:42\
to attend her local high school.\
7:45\
She went on to\
college and graduated\
7:47\
with an undergraduate degree\
in communication disorders\
7:50\
and psychology, and\
after a heroic struggle\
7:53\
against doubting university\
admissions officials,\
7:56\
she entered graduate school\
and completed a master's degree\
7:59\
in speech-language pathology.\
8:01\
Pat now works with 53\
elementary school students\
8:05\
and supervises four\
speech-language technicians\
8:07\
in her school district.\
8:09\
She owns her own home\
and her own automobile,\
8:12\
which friends and\
family members drive\
8:13\
when Pat needs transportation.\
8:17\
At age 10, Pat was\
scheduled to have\
8:19\
yet another medical\
procedure to address\
8:21\
her diminishing eyesight.\
8:23\
Her parents had always\
told her exactly what\
8:25\
was going to happen in\
terms of her medical care,\
8:28\
but for some reason\
they did not tell her\
8:30\
about this particular procedure.\
8:32\
When her parents did tell\
her that the procedure had\
8:35\
been scheduled, Pat, in\
the words of her mother,\
8:37\
"was a mess."\
8:39\
Pat ran to the other\
room but came back later\
8:42\
and said to her parents\
with some indignation:\
8:45\
"Let me tell you what.\
8:47\
I know it, God knows it, and\
you might as well know it too.\
8:55\
I am going to be blind\
the rest of my life!"\
9:03\
Several years ago, Pat\
traveled to California\
9:05\
to visit family members\
who were living there.\
9:08\
While outside with her\
three-year-old nephew,\
9:10\
he said to her, "Aunt\
Pat, why don't you\
9:11\
just ask Heavenly Father\
to give you new eyes?\
9:14\
Because if you ask\
Heavenly Father,\
9:16\
He will give you\
whatever you want.\
9:18\
You just have to ask Him."\
9:21\
Pat said she was taken\
aback by the question\
9:22\
but responded, "Well,\
sometimes Heavenly Father\
9:25\
doesn't work like that.\
9:26\
Sometimes He needs you\
to learn something,\
9:28\
and so He doesn't give\
you everything you want.\
9:31\
Sometimes you have to wait.\
9:33\
Heavenly Father and the Savior\
know best what is good for us\
9:37\
and what we need.\
9:38\
So They aren't\
going to grant you\
9:40\
everything you want in\
the moment you want it."\
9:45\
I've known Pat for many\
years and recently told her\
9:47\
that I admired the fact that she\
is always positive and happy.\
9:50\
She responded,\
"Well, you have not\
9:52\
been at home with me, have you?\
9:55\
I have my moments.\
9:56\
I've had rather severe\
bouts of depression,\
9:58\
and I've cried a lot.\
9:59\
However," she added, "From the\
time I started losing my sight,\
10:03\
it was strange, but I knew that\
Heavenly Father and the Savior\
10:06\
were with my family and me.\
10:08\
We handled it the best way\
we could, and in my opinion,\
10:11\
we handled it the right way.\
10:12\
I have ended up being a\
successful enough person,\
10:15\
and generally I have\
been a happy person.\
10:17\
I remember His hand\
being in everything.\
10:20\
To those who ask me if I am\
angry because I am blind,\
10:23\
I respond, 'Who would\
I be angry with?\
10:26\
Heavenly Father is in this\
with me; I am not alone.\
10:29\
He is with me all the time.'"\
10:32\
In this case, Pat's\
desire to regain her sight\
10:35\
will not be granted\
in this life.\
10:37\
But her motto, learned\
from her father,\
10:39\
is "This too shall pass."\
10:44\
President Henry B. Eyring\
stated, "The Father\
10:46\
is at this moment aware\
of you, your feelings,\
10:49\
and the spiritual and temporal\
needs of everyone around you."\
10:53\
This great and\
comforting truth can\
10:55\
be found in the three\
experiences I have recounted.\
10:59\
Brothers and sisters,\
sometimes our prayers\
11:01\
are answered quickly with\
the outcome we hope for.\
11:04\
Sometimes our prayers\
are not answered\
11:06\
in the way we hope\
for, yet with time we\
11:09\
learn that God had greater\
blessings prepared for us\
11:12\
than we initially anticipated.\
11:14\
And sometimes our\
righteous petitions to God\
11:17\
will not be granted\
in this life.\
11:19\
As Elder Neal A. Maxwell\
said, "Faith also includes\
11:23\
trust in God's timing."\
11:26\
We have the assurance\
that in His own way\
11:28\
and in His own time,\
Heavenly Father\
11:30\
will bless us and resolve all\
of our concerns, injustices,\
11:34\
and disappointments.\
11:35\
To again quote King Benjamin:\
11:38\
"And moreover, I would desire\
that ye should consider\
11:41\
on the blessed and happy\
state of those that\
11:43\
keep the commandments of God.\
11:46\
For behold, they are blessed\
in all things, both temporal\
11:49\
and spiritual; and if they\
hold out faithful to the end\
11:53\
they are received into\
heaven, that thereby they\
11:56\
may dwell with God in a state\
of never-ending happiness.\
11:59\
O remember, remember that\
these things are true;\
12:02\
for the Lord God\
hath spoken it."\
12:04\
I know that God\
hears our prayers.\
12:07\
I know that as an\
all-knowing, loving Father,\
12:10\
He answers our\
prayers perfectly,\
12:13\
according to His\
infinite wisdom,\
12:15\
and in ways that will be to our\
ultimate benefit and blessing.\
12:19\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
