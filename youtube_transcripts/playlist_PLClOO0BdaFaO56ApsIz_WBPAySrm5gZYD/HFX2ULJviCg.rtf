My beloved brothers and\
sisters, my wife Wendy and I\
0:05\
rejoice in being with you\
on this Sabbath morning.\
0:10\
Much has happened since our\
last general conference.\
0:14\
New temples have been\
dedicated in Concepcion, Chile;\
0:18\
Barranquilla, Colombia;\
and Rome, Italy.\
0:23\
We experienced a rich\
outpouring of the Spirit\
0:27\
at these sacred events.\
0:30\
I congratulate the\
many women (and men)\
0:34\
who have recently read\
the Book of Mormon\
0:37\
and discovered joy\
and hidden treasures.\
0:41\
I am inspired by reports\
about miracles received.\
0:48\
I marvel at 11-year-old young\
men who, now as deacons,\
0:53\
worthily pass the\
sacrament each Sunday.\
0:56\
They go to the temple along with\
our 11-year-old young women,\
1:00\
who are now eagerly learning\
and serving as Beehives.\
1:05\
Both young men and young women\
are preaching gospel truths\
1:09\
with clarity and conviction.\
1:12\
I rejoice with\
children and youth\
1:14\
who are helping to teach\
the gospel in their homes\
1:17\
as they work with\
their parents to follow\
1:20\
the home-centered,\
Church-supported curriculum.\
1:24\
We received this photo\
of four-year-old Blake,\
1:29\
who early on a Saturday\
morning grabbed a Church book\
1:32\
and exclaimed, "I need\
to feed my spirit!"\
1:42\
Blake, we are thrilled\
with you and others\
1:44\
who are choosing to feed\
their spirits by feasting\
1:47\
on the truths of the restored\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
1:51\
And we delight in knowing\
that many are receiving\
1:54\
the power of God in their\
lives as they worship\
1:56\
and serve in the temple.\
2:02\
As many of you know, our family\
experienced a tender separation\
2:10\
three months ago when\
our daughter Wendy\
2:14\
departed from this mortal life.\
2:18\
In the final days of\
her battle with cancer,\
2:21\
I was blessed with\
the opportunity\
2:24\
to have a farewell\
daddy-daughter conversation.\
2:30\
I held her hands and told\
her how much I loved her\
2:35\
and how grateful I\
was to be her father.\
2:41\
I said: "You married\
in the temple\
2:44\
and faithfully honored\
your covenants.\
2:47\
You and your husband welcomed\
seven children into your home\
2:52\
and raised them to\
be devout disciples\
2:55\
of Jesus Christ,\
valiant Church members,\
2:58\
and contributing citizens.\
3:00\
And they have chosen spouses\
of that same caliber.\
3:06\
Your daddy is very,\
very proud of you.\
3:12\
You have brought me much joy!"\
3:17\
She quietly responded,\
"Thank you, Daddy."\
3:27\
It was a tender,\
tearful moment for us.\
3:31\
During her 67 years, we worked\
together, sang together,\
3:35\
and often skied together.\
3:37\
But that evening,\
we talked of things\
3:41\
that matter most, such\
as covenants, ordinances,\
3:47\
obedience, faith,\
family, fidelity,\
3:53\
love, and eternal life.\
3:59\
We miss our daughter greatly.\
4:01\
However, because of the\
restored gospel of Jesus Christ,\
4:05\
we do not worry about her.\
4:08\
As we continue to honor\
our covenants with God,\
4:11\
we live in anticipation of\
our being with her again.\
4:17\
Meanwhile, we're\
serving the Lord here,\
4:21\
and she is serving Him\
there--in paradise.\
4:27\
Actually, my wife and I\
visited Paradise earlier this\
4:34\
year--Paradise,\
California, that is.\
4:41\
As it happened,\
our scheduled visit\
4:43\
there came less than 40\
hours after our daughter\
4:47\
departed from this world.\
4:49\
We, along with Elder Kevin W.\
Pearson and his wife, June,\
4:54\
were bolstered by the Saints\
of the Chico California Stake.\
5:00\
We learned of their great\
faith, their ministering,\
5:04\
and the miracles\
that occurred even\
5:06\
amidst their devastating losses\
from the most destructive\
5:11\
wildfire in the\
history of California.\
5:18\
While there, we spoke at length\
with a young police officer,\
5:22\
John, who was one of many\
brave first responders.\
5:29\
He recalled the thick darkness\
that descended upon Paradise\
5:33\
on November 8, 2018, as\
flames and embers raced\
5:39\
through the town, devouring\
property and possessions\
5:43\
like a scourge and\
leaving nothing\
5:47\
but piles of ash and\
stark brick chimneys.\
5:53\
For 15 hours, John drove through\
an impenetrable darkness that\
5:59\
was streaked with javelins of\
threatening embers as he helped\
6:05\
person after person,\
family after family,\
6:08\
escape to safety--all at\
the peril of his own life.\
6:14\
Yet during that\
strenuous ordeal,\
6:17\
what terrified John most was his\
all-consuming question: "Where\
6:22\
is my family?"\
6:26\
After many long, terrifying\
hours of anguish,\
6:30\
he finally learned of\
their safe evacuation.\
6:36\
The account of John's\
concern for his family\
6:39\
has prompted me to speak\
today with those of you who\
6:41\
may ask when approaching\
the end of your mortal life,\
6:47\
"Where is my family?"\
6:51\
In that coming day when you will\
complete your mortal probation\
6:54\
and enter the spirit world, you\
will be brought face-to-face\
6:59\
with that heart-wrenching\
question: "Where is my family?"\
7:07\
Jesus Christ teaches the way\
back to our eternal home.\
7:12\
He understands our\
Heavenly Father's plan\
7:15\
of eternal progression\
better than any of us.\
7:17\
After all, He is the\
keystone of it all.\
7:20\
He is our Redeemer, our\
Healer, and our Savior.\
7:29\
Ever since Adam and\
Eve were expelled\
7:31\
from the Garden of\
Eden, Jesus the Christ\
7:33\
has offered His\
mighty arm to help\
7:36\
all who choose to follow Him.\
7:40\
Repeatedly, scriptures\
record that despite all kinds\
7:45\
of sins from all\
kinds of people,\
7:48\
His arms are outstretched still.\
7:53\
The spirit in each\
of us naturally\
7:55\
yearns for family\
love to last forever.\
7:59\
Love songs perpetuate\
a false hope\
8:03\
that love is all you need if\
you want to be together forever.\
8:07\
And some erroneously believe\
that the Resurrection\
8:11\
of Jesus Christ\
provides a promise\
8:14\
that all people will be with\
their loved ones after death.\
8:20\
In truth, the Savior Himself\
has made it abundantly clear\
8:24\
that while His Resurrection\
assures that every person who\
8:27\
ever lived will indeed be\
resurrected and live forever,\
8:31\
much more is required if we\
want to have the high privilege\
8:35\
of exaltation.\
8:37\
Salvation is an\
individual matter,\
8:41\
but exaltation is\
a family matter.\
8:48\
Listen to these words spoken\
by the Lord Jesus Christ to His\
8:51\
prophet: "All covenants,\
contracts, bonds, obligations,\
9:00\
oaths, vows, performances,\
connections, associations,\
9:04\
or expectations, that\
are not made and entered\
9:09\
into and sealed by the\
Holy Spirit of promise ...\
9:12\
are of no efficacy, virtue,\
or force in and after\
9:18\
the resurrection from the dead;\
for all contracts that are not\
9:23\
made unto this end have\
an end when men are dead."\
9:32\
So, what is required for a\
family to be exalted forever?\
9:37\
We qualify for that privilege\
by making covenants with God,\
9:43\
keeping those covenants, and\
receiving essential ordinances.\
9:50\
This has been true since\
the beginning of time.\
9:54\
Adam and Eve, Noah and his\
wife, Abraham and Sarah, Lehi\
10:02\
and Sariah, and all\
other devoted disciples\
10:06\
of Jesus Christ\
since the world was\
10:08\
created have made the\
same covenants with God.\
10:15\
They have received\
the same ordinances\
10:17\
that we as members of the\
Lord's restored Church today\
10:20\
have made, those\
covenants that we receive\
10:24\
at baptism and in the temple.\
10:27\
The Savior invites all to follow\
Him into the waters of baptism\
10:33\
and, in time, to make\
additional covenants with God\
10:36\
in the temple and\
receive and be faithful\
10:40\
to those further\
essential ordinances.\
10:43\
All these are\
required if we want\
10:46\
to be exalted with our\
families and with God forever.\
10:53\
The anguish of my heart is\
that many people whom I love,\
10:58\
admire, and respect\
decline His invitation.\
11:04\
They ignore the pleadings of\
Jesus Christ when He beckons,\
11:09\
"Come, follow me."\
11:13\
I understand why God weeps.\
11:16\
I also weep for such\
friends and relatives.\
11:21\
They are wonderful men and\
women, devoted to their family\
11:25\
and civic responsibilities.\
11:27\
They give generously of their\
time, energy, and resources.\
11:32\
And the world is better\
for their efforts.\
11:35\
But they have chosen not\
to make covenants with God.\
11:43\
They have not received\
the ordinances that\
11:45\
will exalt them\
with their families\
11:48\
and bind them together forever.\
11:51\
How I wish I could\
visit with them\
11:54\
and invite them to\
seriously consider\
11:56\
the enabling laws of the Lord.\
11:59\
I've wondered what\
I could possibly\
12:01\
say so that they would feel\
how much the Savior loves them\
12:05\
and know how much I love\
them and come to recognize\
12:10\
how covenant-keeping\
women and men can\
12:13\
receive a "fulness of joy."\
12:17\
They need to understand that\
while there is a place for them\
12:21\
hereafter--with wonderful men\
and women who also chose not\
12:27\
to make covenants with God--that\
is not the place where families\
12:32\
will be reunited and be\
given the privilege to live\
12:34\
and progress forever.\
12:36\
That is not the kingdom\
where they will experience\
12:39\
the fulness of joy--of\
never-ending progression\
12:43\
and happiness.\
12:45\
Those consummate\
blessings can come only\
12:49\
by living in an exalted\
celestial realm with God,\
12:53\
our Eternal Father;\
His Son, Jesus Christ;\
12:56\
and our wonderful, worthy,\
and qualified family members.\
13:04\
I feel to say to my\
reticent friends:\
13:08\
"In this life, you\
have never settled\
13:09\
for second best in anything.\
13:12\
Yet, you resist fully\
embracing the restored\
13:16\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
13:18\
You are choosing to\
settle for second best.\
13:24\
"The Savior said, 'In my\
Father's house are many\
13:28\
mansions.'\
13:31\
However, as you choose not\
to make covenants with God,\
13:35\
you are settling for a most\
meager roof over your head\
13:40\
throughout all eternity."\
13:45\
I would further entreat my\
reticent friends by saying:\
13:50\
"Pour out your heart to God.\
13:52\
Ask Him if these\
things are true.\
13:55\
Make time to study His words.\
13:58\
Really study!\
14:00\
If you truly love your family\
and if you desire to be exalted\
14:04\
with them throughout eternity,\
pay the price now--through\
14:08\
serious study and fervent\
prayer--to know these eternal\
14:13\
truths and then\
to abide by them.\
14:20\
"If you are not sure you even\
believe in God, start there.\
14:24\
Understand that in the absence\
of experiences with God,\
14:28\
one can doubt the\
existence of God.\
14:31\
So put yourself in a position\
to begin having experiences\
14:36\
with Him.\
14:37\
Humble yourself.\
14:39\
Pray to have eyes to see\
God's hand in your life\
14:43\
and in the world around you.\
14:45\
Ask Him to tell you if He is\
really there--if He knows you.\
14:52\
Ask Him how He feels about you.\
14:54\
And then listen."\
14:59\
One such dear friend of mine had\
limited experiences with God.\
15:03\
But he longed to be\
with his departed wife,\
15:07\
so he asked me to help him.\
15:10\
I encouraged him to meet\
with our missionaries\
15:14\
in order to understand\
the doctrine of Christ\
15:16\
and learn of gospel covenants,\
ordinances, and blessings.\
15:22\
That he did.\
15:23\
But he felt the\
course they advised\
15:26\
would require him to make\
too many changes in his life.\
15:30\
He said, "Those\
commandments and covenants\
15:33\
are just too difficult for me.\
15:36\
Also, I can't\
possibly pay tithing,\
15:39\
and I don't have time\
to serve in the Church."\
15:44\
Then he asked me, "Once I die,\
please do the necessary temple\
15:51\
work for my wife and me so\
that we can be together again."\
16:01\
Thankfully, I am not\
this man's judge,\
16:06\
but I do question the efficacy\
of proxy temple work for a man\
16:10\
who had the opportunity to be\
baptized in this life--to be\
16:14\
ordained to the priesthood and\
receive temple blessings while\
16:17\
here in mortality--but who\
made the conscious decision\
16:21\
to reject that course.\
16:26\
My dear brothers and\
sisters, Jesus Christ\
16:30\
invites us to take the covenant\
path back home to our Heavenly\
16:35\
Parents and be\
with those we love.\
16:39\
He invites us to\
"come, follow me."\
16:47\
Now, as President\
of His Church, I\
16:50\
plead with you who have\
distanced yourselves\
16:53\
from the Church and with\
you who have not yet\
16:58\
really sought to know that\
the Savior's Church has\
17:01\
been restored.\
17:02\
Do the spiritual work to\
find out for yourselves,\
17:07\
and please do it now.\
17:10\
Time is running out.\
17:14\
I testify that God lives!\
17:17\
Jesus is the Christ.\
17:19\
His Church and the\
fulness of His gospel\
17:21\
have been restored to bless\
our lives with joy here\
17:27\
and hereafter.\
17:29\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
