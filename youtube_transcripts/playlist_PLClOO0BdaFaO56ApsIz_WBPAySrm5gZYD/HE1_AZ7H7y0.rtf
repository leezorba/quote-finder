the Council on the Disposition\

0:17\
of the First Presidency, the\
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,\

Church Auditing, which consists\
of credentialed professionals\
0:36\
and is independent of all\
other Church departments,\
0:39\
has responsibility\
to perform audits\
0:42\
for the purpose of providing\
reasonable assurance regarding\
0:45\
contributions received,\
expenditures made,\
0:49\
and safeguarding\
of Church assets.\
0:52\
Based upon audits\
performed, Church Auditing\
0:55\
is of the opinion that\
in all material respects,\
0:58\
contributions received,\
expenditures made,\
1:01\
and assets of the\
Church for the year 2018\
1:04\
have been recorded\
and administered\
1:07\
in accordance with approved\
Church budgets, policies,\
1:11\
and accounting practices.\
1:13\
The Church follows\
the practices taught\
1:15\
to its members of\
living within a budget,\
1:18\
avoiding debt, and saving\
against a time of need.\
1:22\
Respectfully submitted,\
Church Auditing Department.\

Kevin R. Jergensen,\
