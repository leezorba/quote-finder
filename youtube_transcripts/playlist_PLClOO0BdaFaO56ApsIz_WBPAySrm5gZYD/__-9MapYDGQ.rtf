My dear brothers and\
sisters, as this conference\
0:05\
comes to a close, I give\
thanks to our Father\
0:08\
in Heaven for the counsel,\
truths, and revelation\
0:12\
shared at this pulpit\
during the past two days.\
0:16\
We have been taught\
by servants of God\
0:18\
called to speak His holy words.\
0:21\
The Lord has reminded us\
in latter-day revelation,\
0:25\
"Whether by mine own voice or\
... the voice of my servants,\
0:29\
it is the same."\
0:32\
Looking over this vast\
congregation of Saints\
0:35\
and picturing members\
watching general conference\
0:38\
all over the world, I\
think of the gathering\
0:41\
in the Book of Mormon\
when Jesus Christ\
0:44\
appeared to the Nephites\
following His Crucifixion.\
0:48\
He taught them the\
gospel, and then He\
0:50\
encouraged, "Go ye\
unto your homes,\
0:54\
and ponder upon the\
things which I have said,\
0:58\
and ask of the Father, in my\
name, that ye may understand."\
1:04\
"Go ye unto your\
homes, and ponder"\
1:07\
is the next step\
in taking to heart\
1:11\
the words of prophets\
and Church leaders\
1:13\
spoken in this sacred setting.\
1:16\
Christ-centered homes are\
fortresses for the kingdom\
1:20\
of God on earth in a\
day when, as prophesied,\
1:25\
the devil "rage[s] in the\
hearts of the children of men,\
1:29\
and stir[s] them up to anger\
against that which is good."\
1:35\
People have built fortresses\
throughout history\
1:38\
to keep the enemy outside.\
1:41\
Often those fortresses\
included a guard tower where\
1:45\
watchmen--like prophets--warned\
of menacing forces and coming\
1:51\
attacks.\
1:53\
In early Utah pioneer times,\
my great-grandfather Thomas\
1:59\
Rasband and his family were\
some of the first settlers\
2:03\
to enter the Heber Valley\
in the beautiful Wasatch\
2:07\
mountains of Utah.\
2:09\
In 1859, Thomas helped\
construct the Heber fort\
2:14\
built for their protection.\
2:17\
It was a simple structure\
of cottonwood logs,\
2:20\
positioned one\
next to the other,\
2:23\
forming the perimeter\
of the fort.\
2:26\
Log cabins were built\
inside the fortress\
2:29\
using that common wall.\
2:32\
The structure provided\
both security and safety\
2:36\
for those pioneer\
families as they put down\
2:39\
roots and worshipped the Lord.\
2:43\
So it is with us.\
2:45\
Our homes are fortresses\
against the evils of the world.\
2:50\
In our homes we come\
unto Christ by learning\
2:53\
to follow His commandments,\
by studying the scriptures\
2:57\
and praying together, and\
by helping one another stay\
3:01\
on the covenant path.\
3:04\
The new emphasis on\
personal and family study\
3:07\
in the home through\
the curriculum Come,\
3:10\
Follow Me is designed\
"to deepen our conversion\
3:14\
and help us become more\
like Jesus Christ."\
3:18\
In so doing we will become what\
Paul called "new creature[s]"\
3:24\
with our hearts and\
souls in tune with God.\
3:28\
We need that strength\
to face and deflect\
3:33\
the assaults of the adversary.\
3:36\
As we live with devotion born\
of faith in Jesus Christ,\
3:41\
we will feel the peaceful\
presence of the Holy Ghost, who\
3:45\
guides us to truth,\
inspires us to live worthy\
3:49\
of the Lord's blessings,\
and bears witness\
3:52\
that God lives and loves us.\
3:55\
All this within the\
fortress of our own homes.\
4:00\
But remember, our\
homes are only as\
4:03\
powerful as the spiritual\
strength of each one of us\
4:08\
within the walls.\
4:11\
Dear President Russell M. Nelson\
has taught, "In coming days,\
4:16\
it will not be possible\
to survive spiritually\
4:20\
without the guiding,\
directing, comforting,\
4:23\
and constant influence\
of the Holy Ghost."\
4:28\
As the Lord's living\
prophet, seer, and revelator\
4:32\
in this day, the watchman on\
the tower of our fortress,\
4:37\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints,\
4:40\
he sees the advances\
of the enemy.\
4:47\
Brothers and sisters,\
we are at war with Satan\
4:50\
for the souls of men.\
4:52\
The battle lines were drawn\
in our pre-earth life.\
4:56\
Satan and a third of our\
Father in Heaven's children\
5:00\
turned away from His\
promises of exaltation.\
5:04\
Since that time, the\
adversary's minions\
5:07\
have been fighting the faithful\
who choose the Father's plan.\
5:13\
Satan knows his\
days are numbered,\
5:15\
and that time is\
growing shorter.\
5:18\
As crafty and cunning as\
he is, he will not win.\
5:24\
However, his battle for each\
one of our souls rages on.\
5:32\
For our protection, we\
must build a fortress\
5:35\
of spirituality and\
protection for our very souls,\
5:40\
a fortress that will not be\
penetrated by the evil one.\
5:46\
Satan is a subtle snake,\
sneaking into our minds\
5:50\
and hearts when we have\
let our guard down, faced\
5:54\
a disappointment, or lost hope.\
5:57\
He entices us with\
flattery, a promise of ease,\
6:02\
comfort, or a temporary\
high when we are low.\
6:07\
He justifies pride, unkindness,\
dishonesty, discontent,\
6:13\
and immorality, and in time\
we can be "past feeling."\
6:19\
The Spirit can leave us.\
6:22\
"And thus the devil\
cheateth their souls,\
6:25\
and leadeth them away\
carefully down to hell."\
6:32\
In contrast, we often feel\
the Spirit so powerfully\
6:36\
as we sing praises to God\
with words like these:\
6:41\
"A mighty fortress is our God,\
6:44\
A tower of strength\
ne'er failing.\
6:47\
A helper mighty is our God,\
6:50\
O'er ills of life prevailing."\
6:54\
When we build a fortress\
of spiritual strength,\
6:57\
we can shun the advances\
of the adversary,\
7:01\
turn our backs on him, and\
feel the peace of the Spirit.\
7:05\
We can follow the\
example of our Lord\
7:08\
and Savior, who, when tempted\
in the wilderness, said,\
7:12\
"Get thee behind me, Satan."\
7:15\
We each have to learn by\
the experiences of life\
7:20\
how to do that.\
7:22\
Such righteous purpose is well\
described in the Book of Mormon\
7:26\
when Captain Moroni prepared\
the Nephites to face attacks\
7:31\
from a deceitful, bloodthirsty,\
power-hungry Amalickiah.\
7:36\
Moroni constructed fortresses\
to protect the Nephites,\
7:42\
"that they might live\
unto the Lord their God,\
7:45\
and that they\
might maintain that\
7:47\
which was called\
by their enemies\
7:50\
the cause of Christians."\
7:53\
Moroni was "firm in\
the faith of Christ,"\
7:56\
and the people were faithful "in\
keeping the commandments of God\
8:00\
... and resisting iniquity."\
8:04\
When the Lamanites\
came to battle,\
8:06\
they were astonished by\
the Nephites' preparation,\
8:09\
and they were defeated.\
8:13\
The Nephites thanked "the\
Lord their God, because\
8:18\
of his matchless power\
in delivering them\
8:21\
from the hands of\
their enemies."\
8:24\
They had built fortresses for\
protection on the outside,\
8:29\
and they had built faith\
in the Lord Jesus Christ\
8:33\
on the inside--deep\
in their souls.\
8:39\
What are some ways we\
can fortify ourselves\
8:42\
in troubled times, that\
we may be "instruments\
8:46\
in the hands of God to bring\
about this great work"?\
8:50\
Let's look to the scriptures.\
8:53\
We are obedient.\
8:54\
The Lord commanded Father\
Lehi to send his sons\
8:58\
back to Jerusalem to\
"seek the records,\
9:01\
and bring them down hither\
into the wilderness."\
9:05\
Lehi didn't question; he\
didn't wonder why or how.\
9:10\
Nor did Nephi, who\
responded, "I will go and do\
9:15\
the things which the\
Lord hath commanded."\
9:18\
Do we act with the willing\
obedience of Nephi?\
9:23\
Or are we more inclined\
to question God's commands\
9:27\
as did Nephi's brothers,\
whose lack of faith\
9:31\
eventually turned them\
away from the Lord?\
9:34\
Obedience, exercised\
with "holiness of heart,"\
9:38\
is what the Lord asks of us.\
9:44\
We trust the Lord, who said to\
Joshua as he prepared to lead\
9:48\
the Israelites into the promised\
land, "Be strong and of ...\
9:52\
good courage; be not afraid,\
neither be thou dismayed:\
9:57\
for the Lord thy God is with\
thee whithersoever thou goest."\
10:02\
Joshua trusted those words\
and counseled the people,\
10:07\
"Sanctify yourselves:\
for to morrow\
10:10\
the Lord will do\
wonders among you."\
10:14\
The Lord parted the\
waters of the Jordan,\
10:17\
and the Israelites' 40 years\
of wandering in the wilderness\
10:21\
ended.\
10:23\
We stand for the truth,\
as did the prophet Abinadi\
10:27\
in the Book of Mormon.\
10:28\
Arrested, brought before King\
Noah and his wicked priests,\
10:33\
Abinadi taught the Ten\
Commandments and preached\
10:37\
powerfully that Christ would\
"come down among the children\
10:41\
of men, and ...\
redeem his people."\
10:45\
He then, with faith\
deep within him,\
10:49\
proclaimed, "O God,\
receive my soul,"\
10:53\
and Abinadi "suffered\
death by fire."\
10:58\
We make and renew our covenants\
by partaking of the sacrament\
11:02\
and by worshipping\
in the temple.\
11:04\
The sacrament is the centerpiece\
of our Sunday worship, where\
11:09\
we are receiving the promise\
to "always have his Spirit\
11:12\
to be with [us]."\
11:14\
With that sacred\
ordinance we commit\
11:16\
to take upon us the name of\
Jesus Christ, to follow Him,\
11:21\
and to shoulder our\
responsibilities\
11:24\
in this divine work as He did.\
11:27\
In the temple, we can "lay\
aside the things of this world"\
11:32\
and feel the Lord's presence\
and His transcendent peace.\
11:36\
We can focus on our ancestors,\
our families, and eternal life\
11:41\
in the presence of the Father.\
11:43\
No wonder President Nelson\
stated recently in Rome,\
11:48\
"The good that will\
emanate from this temple\
11:52\
is incalculably great."\
11:57\
We should have integrity\
in all that we do.\
12:00\
We should develop\
discernment and discipline\
12:03\
so that we do not have to\
continually determine what\
12:07\
is right and what is wrong.\
12:09\
We should take to\
heart the caution\
12:11\
of Peter, the early Church\
Apostle, who cautioned,\
12:16\
"Be sober, be vigilant; because\
your adversary the devil,\
12:22\
as a roaring lion,\
walketh about,\
12:26\
seeking whom he may devour."\
12:31\
As we diligently strengthen\
our fortifications,\
12:34\
we become like Jesus Christ,\
as His true disciples,\
12:39\
with our very souls\
in His protection.\
12:45\
Your testimony of Jesus Christ\
is your personal fortress,\
12:49\
the security for your soul.\
12:52\
When my grandfather\
and his fellow pioneers\
12:55\
built the Heber fort, they\
put up one log at a time\
13:00\
until the fort was\
"fitly framed together"\
13:03\
and they were protected.\
13:07\
So it is with testimony.\
13:09\
One by one we gain a\
witness from the Holy Spirit\
13:13\
as He speaks to our own\
spirit, teaching "truth\
13:17\
in the inward parts."\
13:19\
When we live the gospel\
of Jesus Christ, when\
13:23\
we draw upon the\
Savior's Atonement\
13:25\
and press forward\
with faith, not fear,\
13:29\
we are fortified against\
the wiles of the adversary.\
13:33\
Our testimonies connect\
us to the heavens,\
13:36\
and we are blessed with\
"the truth of all things."\
13:41\
And like a fortress,\
we are safely\
13:44\
encircled in the arms\
of the Savior's love.\
13:52\
The prophet Ether taught,\
"Wherefore, whoso believeth\
13:57\
in God might with surety\
hope for a better world, yea,\
14:02\
even a place at the\
right hand of God,\
14:05\
which hope cometh of\
faith, maketh an anchor\
14:09\
to the souls of men, which would\
make them sure and steadfast,\
14:14\
always abounding in good works,\
being led to glorify God."\
14:22\
My dear brothers and\
sisters, I leave you\
14:25\
with my blessing to go forth\
with confidence in the Lord\
14:30\
and in His gospel.\
14:32\
Put your arms around\
those who stumble,\
14:35\
and with the strength of\
the Spirit within you,\
14:38\
lead them lovingly\
back to the fortress\
14:42\
of spirituality and protection.\
14:45\
Seek "to be like Jesus"\
in all that you do;\
14:48\
shun evil and temptations;\
repent, as we were admonished\
14:54\
yesterday by our dear\
prophet; be honest in heart;\
14:58\
be upright and pure; show\
compassion and charity;\
15:03\
and love the Lord your\
God with the devotion\
15:08\
of a true disciple.\
15:11\
Our testimonies of the gospel\
of Jesus Christ, our homes,\
15:16\
our families, and our membership\
in The Church of Jesus\
15:20\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
will be our personal fortress\
15:25\
of protection, surrounding\
us and shielding us\
15:30\
from the power of the evil one.\
15:33\
Of this I bear my solemn\
witness in the name\
15:37\
of our Lord and Savior,\
even Jesus Christ, amen.\
