A powerful king desired for his son to\
rule over one of his kingdoms.\
0:07\
The prince had to learn and grow in\
wisdom to sit on the throne.\
0:12\
One day the king met with the prince and\
shared his plan.\
0:17\
They agreed the prince will go to a\
different town and gain experiences.\
0:22\
He would face challenges as well as\
enjoy many good things there.\
0:28\
The king then sent him to the town where\
the prince was expected to prove\
0:33\
his faithfulness to the king and\
demonstrate that he was fit to\
0:38\
receive the privileges and\
responsibilities the King had in\
0:42\
store for him.\
0:45\
The prince was given liberty to choose\
to receive these privileges\
0:50\
and responsibilities or not, depending\
on his desires and his faithfulness.\
0:57\
I am sure you want to know what happened\
to the prince.\
1:01\
Did he return to inherit the kingdom?\
1:05\
Dear brothers and sisters, each of us is\
a prince and princess.\
1:11\
We have been sent to mortality by a\
loving Heavenly Father to enjoy\
1:15\
the blessing of a body that would become\
immortal through the Atonement\
1:20\
and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.\
1:23\
We are expected to prepare to return to\
God's presence by proving that we will\
1:28\
do all things whatsoever the Lord, our\
God, shall command us.\
1:35\
To help us, the Savior came to redeem us\
and show the path to return to God.\
1:42\
God's children are invited to come to\
the Savior and be perfected in Him.\
1:49\
In the scriptures, we find the\
invitation for us to come to\
1:53\
the Lord, repeated over 90 times, and\
more than half of these are\
2:00\
personal invitations from the Lord\
Himself.\
2:05\
Accepting the Savior's invitation means\
partaking of His ordinances\
2:10\
and keeping our covenants with Him.\
2:13\
Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and\
the life and invites us all\
2:19\
to come unto Him and partake of His\
goodness.\
2:23\
And he denieth none that come unto Him.\
2:28\
Gospel learning and teaching deepen our\
conversion to Heavenly Father\
2:34\
and Jesus Christ and help us become more\
like Them.\
2:38\
Even though not all things have been\
revealed concerning the precise time\
2:43\
and manner in which the blessings of\
exaltation will be bestowed, we are\
2:48\
nonetheless assured of them.\
2:52\
Alma, the high priest teaching in the\
land of Zarahemla, recounted\
2:57\
a profound invitation by Jesus Christ\
that "behold, he sendeth an invitation\
3:04\
unto all men, for the hands of mercy are\
extend towards them.\
3:09\
And he saith, Repent, and I will receive\
you here.\
3:13\
He saith, Come unto me and you shall\
partake of the fruit of the tree of\
3:18\
life." The Savior himself invites us to\
come unto Him and take His yoke upon us\
3:26\
that we may have rest in this tumultuous\
world.\
3:32\
We've come unto Christ by exercising\
faith in him, repenting daily, making\
3:39\
covenants with God as we receive the\
ordinances of salvation\
3:43\
and exaltation, and enduring to the end\
by keeping those covenants.\
3:52\
The path to perfection is the covenant\
path, and Jesus Christ is the center of\
3:58\
all ordinances and covenants.\
4:02\
King Benjamin thought that because of\
the covenant we make, we become sons\
4:07\
and daughters of Christ who has\
spiritually begotten us, and under His\
4:11\
head are we made free, for "there is no\
other name given whereby salvation\
4:18\
cometh." We are saved as we endure to\
the end by following the example of\
4:24\
the Son of the living God.\
4:26\
Nephi counseled that all is not done by\
merely getting into the "strait\
4:32\
and narrow path." We "must press forward\
with the steadfastness in\
4:38\
Christ, having a perfect brightness of\
hope, and a love of God and of all\
4:44\
men." The doctrine of Christ helps us\
find and stay on the covenant\
4:49\
path, and the gospel is so arranged that\
the Lord's promised blessings are\
4:54\
received through sacred ordinances and\
covenants.\
4:58\
God's prophet, President Russell M.\
5:01\
Nelson admonished us in his January 16,\
2018, telecast to, quote, "Keep\
5:09\
on the covenant path.\
5:10\
your commitments to follow the Savior by\
making covenant with him and then\
5:15\
keeping [those] covenants with hope on\
the door to every spiritual blessing\
5:21\
and privilege available to men, women\
and children everywhere...\
5:27\
The end for which each of us strives is\
to be endowed with\
5:31\
power in a house of the Lord.\
5:33\
Sealed as families, faithful to\
covenants made in a temple that qualify\
5:39\
us for the greatest gift of God, that of\
eternal life." Close quotes.\
5:47\
God will not abandon His relationship\
with or withhold His promised blessings\
5:54\
of eternal life from every faithful\
covenant keeper.\
6:00\
And as we honor sacred covenants, we are\
drawn closer to\
6:04\
the Savior.\
6:06\
Elder David A. Bednar \
taught us yesterday\
6:08\
the gospel covenants and ordinances\
operate in our\
6:11\
lives like a compass, to give us\
cardinal direction, to come unto Christ\
6:18\
and become more like Him.\
6:21\
The ordinances, covenants mark the path\
back to God, the ordinances of\
6:27\
baptism and receiving the gift of the\
Holy Ghost, priesthood,\
6:31\
ordination, and the sacrament lead us to\
the Lord's temple to partake of His\
6:37\
ordinances of exaltation.\
6:40\
I would like to mention two things our\
Savior emphasized to help us faithfully\
6:46\
keep covenants.\
6:48\
One, the Holy Ghost can teach us, remind\
us of the Savior's\
6:54\
teachings, and abide with us forever.\
6:58\
He can be our constant companion to\
guide us on the path, on the covenant\
7:03\
path, President Russell M.\
7:05\
Herb Nelson taught, quote, "In coming\
days, it will not be possible to\
7:11\
survive spiritually without the guiding,\
directing, comforting\
7:16\
and constant influence of the Holy\
Ghost," close quote.\
7:21\
Two, the Savior instituted the ordinance\
of the sacrament that we\
7:26\
may always remember Him and have His\
Spirit to be with us.\
7:31\
Baptism opens the gate to eternal life,\
and the sacrament helps us to\
7:38\
steadfastly press forward along the\
covenant path.\
7:43\
As we partake, as we take the sacrament.\
7:46\
it shall be a testimony to the Father\
that we do always remember his\
7:51\
Son, and as we always remember Him and\
keep His commandments, we shall\
7:56\
have His Spirit to be with us.\
8:00\
How did to this promise the Lord renews\
the promised remission of sin as we\
8:08\
humbly repent of our sins.\
8:11\
In staying faithful to our covenants, we\
shall endeavor to always\
8:16\
have the Spirit, to prepare us to\
worthily partake of the sacrament.\
8:22\
And likewise, we regularly partake of\
the sacrament to always have\
8:28\
the Spirit with us.\
8:30\
When our daughter was five years old,\
she had a battery-powered motorcar\
8:36\
and loved to drive it around the house.\
8:40\
One evening, she came to me and said,\
"Daddy, my car no longer drives.\
8:46\
Could we get some gas from your car to\
put in it so it can drive again?\
8:53\
Perhaps it needs gas like your car to\
drive."\
8:58\
I later observed that the battery power\
was down.\
9:02\
So I said, "We will get it to drive in\
about an hour." With so much\
9:08\
excitement, she said, "Yes, we will take\
it to the gas station."\
9:15\
I simply connected the battery to an\
electric source to charge.\
9:20\
And after an hour, she was able to drive\
the car, powered by the charged battery.\
9:28\
She thereafter learned that it is\
important to always recharge\
9:32\
the battery by connecting it to an\
electric source.\
9:36\
As our daughter learned the relationship\
between the battery\
9:41\
and power to drive our toy car, so we\
learn about Jesus\
9:46\
Christ, the sacrament, and the Spirit.\
9:50\
We need the Spirit to help us navigate\
through mortality as we faithfully keep\
9:58\
covenants and the sacrament to energize\
our spiritual being.\
10:05\
Renewing our baptismal covenant and\
partaking of the sacrament drives\
10:10\
faithfulness to all other covenants.\
10:15\
A happy ending is assured as we\
prayerfully study and honor\
10:21\
the Savior's invitation and enjoy his\
promised blessings.\
10:25\
He said, "And that thou mayest more\
fully keep thyself unspotted from\
10:32\
the world, thou shalt go to the house of\
prayer and offer up thy sacraments\
10:38\
upon my holy day." I testify that\
covenant keepers are promised peace in\
10:45\
this world and eternal life in the world\
to come.\
10:49\
I bear witness that as you regularly\
partake of the Savior's emblem through\
10:54\
the sacrament, you will have the Spirit\
to guide you on\
10:59\
the covenant path and stay faithful to\
your covenant.\
11:03\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
