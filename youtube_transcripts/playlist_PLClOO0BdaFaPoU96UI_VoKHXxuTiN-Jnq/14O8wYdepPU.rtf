Sisters, what a joy to gather in a\
worldwide sisterhood.\
0:06\
As women who make and keep covenants\
with God, we share spiritual bonds that\
0:12\
help us meet the challenges of our day\
and prepare us for the Second Coming of\
0:16\
Jesus Christ, and keeping those\
covenants allows us to be women of\
0:20\
influence who can draw others to the\
Savior.\
0:24\
Those who have been baptized, covenanted\
on that\
0:27\
never-to-be-forgotten day, to take Jesus\
Christ's name upon them, to\
0:31\
always remember Him, to keep His\
commandments, and to serve him to\
0:35\
the end.\
0:37\
When we do these things, Heavenly Father\
promises to forgive our sins\
0:41\
and give us the companionship of the\
Holy Ghost.\
0:44\
These blessings start us on the path\
that, if we press forward and endure to\
0:48\
the end, will allow us to live with Him\
and His Son in the celestial kingdom.\
0:54\
Every baptized person has a promise of\
these privileges if she or he keeps\
0:59\
the covenant made that special day.\
1:03\
Those who make further covenants in the\
temple receive powerful promises\
1:07\
conditioned on personal faithfulness.\
1:10\
We solemnly promise to obey God's\
commandments, live the gospel of Jesus\
1:14\
Christ, be morally pure, and dedicate\
our time and talents to the Lord.\
1:20\
In return, God promises blessings in\
this life and the opportunity to return\
1:25\
to Him.\
1:27\
In that process, we are given or endowed\
with the power to discern\
1:32\
between truth and error, between right\
and wrong, amid the confusing\
1:37\
and negative voices that bombard us.\
1:40\
What a powerful gift.\
1:43\
In preparation for my first trip to the\
temple, my mother and experienced\
1:47\
Relief Society sisters helped me select\
the items I would need, including\
1:52\
beautiful ceremonial clothing.\
1:54\
But the most important preparation came\
even before knowing what to wear.\
1:59\
After interviewing me to determine if I\
was worthy, my bishop explained\
2:04\
the covenants I would make.\
2:06\
His careful explanation gave me the\
chance to think about and be\
2:10\
prepared to make those covenants.\
2:13\
When the day came, I participated with a\
feeling of gratitude and peace.\
2:19\
Even though I did not understand the\
full significance of the covenants\
2:21\
I made, I did know that I was bound to\
God through those covenants and was\
2:27\
promised blessings I could scarcely\
comprehend if I kept them.\
2:32\
Since that first experience, I have been\
continually assured that keeping\
2:36\
the covenants we make with God allows us\
to draw upon the Savior's\
2:40\
power, which strengthens us in our\
inevitable trials, provides protection\
2:45\
from the adversary's influence, and\
prepares us for eternal glory.\
2:50\
Life's experiences can range from\
humorous to heart-wrenching, from grim\
2:55\
to glorious.\
2:57\
Each experience helps us understand more\
about our Father's encompassing\
3:01\
love and our capacity to change through\
the Savior's gift of grace.\
3:06\
Keeping our covenants allows the\
Savior's power to cleanse us as we\
3:09\
learn through experience, whether it is\
a minor misjudgment or a major failing.\
3:16\
Our Redeemer is there to catch us when\
we fall, if we turn to Him.\
3:22\
Have you ever stood on a high cliff with\
your toes on its edge and your\
3:26\
back to the abyss below?\
3:29\
In rappelling, even though you are\
securely connected to a system of\
3:33\
strong ropes and equipment that can\
deliver you to safety, standing on\
3:37\
the edge is still heart-racing.\
3:40\
Stepping backward off the cliff and\
swinging into thin air requires\
3:44\
trust in an anchor secure to an\
immovable object.\
3:48\
It demands trust in the person who will\
apply tension to the rope\
3:51\
as you descend.\
3:54\
And although the equipment provides you\
with some ability to control your\
3:56\
descent, you must have confidence that\
your partner will not allow you to fall.\
4:03\
I vividly remember rappelling with a\
group of young women.\
4:06\
I was first in the group to go.\
4:08\
As I stepped backwards off the cliff, I\
began to fall without control.\
4:14\
Gratefully, the rope jerked, and my\
too-rapid descent was stopped.\
4:18\
As I dangled halfway down the jagged\
rock face, I prayed fervently\
4:21\
for whomever or whatever was keeping me\
from dropping onto the rocks.\
4:27\
Later, I learned that the anchor boat\
had not been securely set, and as\
4:31\
I stepped off the edge, the person\
belaying me was jerked on his back\
4:36\
and pulled towards the edge of the\
cliff.\
4:38\
Somehow he wedged his feet against some\
rocks.\
4:41\
Stabilized in that position, he was able\
to laboriously lower me hand over\
4:45\
hand with the rope.\
4:48\
Although I couldn't see him, I knew he\
was working with all his strength to\
4:52\
save me.\
4:53\
Another friend was at the bottom of the\
cliff, prepared to catch me if\
4:56\
the rope ceased to hold.\
4:58\
As I came within reach, he caught my\
harness and lowered me to the ground.\
5:04\
With Jesus Christ as our anchor and\
perfect partner, we are assured of\
5:09\
His loving strength in trial and of\
eventual deliverance through Him.\
5:14\
As President M.\
5:15\
Russell Ballard taught, "Faith in God\
and in his Son, the Lord Jesus\
5:19\
Christ, is the anchor we must have in\
our lives to hold us fast during times\
5:24\
of social turbulence and wickedness.\
5:27\
Our faith must be centered in Jesus\
Christ, His life and His\
5:31\
Atonement, and in the restoration of His\
gospel."\
5:36\
The spiritual equipment that keeps us\
from being broken on the rocks of\
5:39\
adversity is our testimony of Jesus\
Christ and the covenants we make.\
5:44\
We can rely on these supports to guide\
and carry us to safety.\
5:48\
As our willing partner, the Savior will\
not allow us to fall beyond His reach.\
5:54\
Even in our times of suffering and\
sorrow, He is there to lift\
5:58\
and encourage.\
6:00\
His power helps us recover from the\
often devastating impact\
6:03\
of othersâ€™ choices.\
6:05\
However, we each must put on the harness\
and make sure the knots are\
6:11\
securely tied.\
6:12\
We must choose to be\
anchored to the Savior,\
6:15\
to be bound to Him by our covenants.\
6:19\
How do we strengthen that anchor?\
6:21\
We pray with a humble heart, study and\
ponder the scriptures, take\
6:26\
the sacrament with a spirit of\
repentance and reverence, strive to\
6:30\
keep the commandments, and follow the\
prophet's counsel.\
6:34\
And as we fulfill our everyday tasks in\
higher and holier ways, we become more\
6:39\
connected to the Savior and, at the same\
time, help others come unto Him.\
6:46\
What does that higher and holier way\
look like?\
6:49\
We try to live the gospel in all our\
interactions.\
6:52\
We care for those in need by truly\
ministering, expressing love through\
6:55\
simple service.\
6:57\
We share the good news of the gospel\
with those who need peace and strength\
7:00\
and know not where to find it.\
7:03\
We work to unite families for eternity\
on both sides of the veil.\
7:08\
And for those who have made covenants in\
the house of the Lord, as President\
7:11\
Russell M Nelson explained, "Each adult\
temple patron will wear the sacred\
7:16\
garment of the priesthood, which reminds\
us to walk on the covenant path\
7:21\
each day in a higher and holier way."\
7:26\
These actions are not just an occasional\
splurge but are essential\
7:29\
to our daily happiness and eternal joy.\
7:34\
There is nothing more important to our\
eternal progress than keeping our\
7:37\
covenants with God.\
7:39\
When our temple covenants are in force,\
we can trust in a joyful reunion\
7:43\
with loved ones on the other side of the\
veil.\
7:46\
That child or parent or spouse who has\
left mortality is hoping, with all his\
7:51\
or her heart, that you will be true to\
the covenants that bind you together.\
7:56\
If we disregard or treat lightly our\
covenants with God, we are putting\
8:00\
those eternal ties in danger.\
8:03\
Now is a time to repent, repair, and try\
again.\
8:09\
Happiness is hollow if we exchange the\
blessings of eternal joy\
8:13\
for momentary ease.\
8:15\
No matter our age, that is the absolute\
truth.\
8:19\
The key to lasting happiness is living\
the gospel of Jesus Christ and keeping\
8:24\
our covenants.\
8:26\
Our prophet, President Nelson, has\
affirmed that "our ultimate security\
8:30\
and our only enduring happiness lies in\
holding to the iron rod of\
8:35\
the restored gospel of Jesus Christ,\
complete with its covenants\
8:39\
and ordinances.\
8:41\
When we do so, we can safely navigate\
through rough waters, because we have\
8:45\
access to God's power."\
8:49\
Many of us are experiencing rough\
waters.\
8:52\
As we are tossed by waves of adversity\
and are sometimes blinded by\
8:56\
the torrents of tears that come in those\
difficulties, we may not know\
9:00\
which direction to paddle our life's\
boat.\
9:03\
We may not think we have the strength to\
get to shore.\
9:06\
Remembering who you are, a beloved child\
of God, while you're on\
9:11\
the earth and your goal of living with\
God and your loved ones can clear your\
9:16\
vision and point you in the right\
direction.\
9:20\
In the midst of the storm, there is a\
bright light to show the way.\
9:24\
"I am the light which shineth at the\
darkness," Jesus declared.\
9:28\
We are assured of safety when we look to\
His light and maintain\
9:33\
the integrity of our covenants.\
9:36\
It has been a privilege to meet women of\
all ages living in a wide variety of\
9:40\
circumstances who are keeping their\
covenants.\
9:43\
Each day they look to the Lord and His\
prophet for guidance, rather than to\
9:47\
popular media.\
9:48\
Despite their individual challenges and\
the detrimental philosophies of\
9:52\
the world that try to dissuade them from\
keeping their covenants, they are\
9:56\
determined to stay on the covenant path.\
9:59\
They rely on the promise of all that the\
Father hath.\
10:03\
And whatever your age, each of you women\
who has made covenants with God\
10:07\
has the ability to hold up the Lord's\
light and lead others to Him.\
10:12\
Through keeping your covenant, He will\
bless you with His priesthood power\
10:16\
and enable you to have a profound\
influence on all with whom you interact.\
10:21\
As President Nelson declared, you are\
the women who will fulfill\
10:25\
the prophecies that have been foretold.\
10:29\
Dear sisters, above all else, stay on\
the covenant path to Jesus Christ.\
10:35\
We have been blessed to come to Earth\
when temples dot the globe.\
10:39\
Making and keeping temple covenants is\
available to every worthy member of\
10:42\
the church.\
10:43\
Young adults, you don't need to wait\
until marriage or a mission to make\
10:47\
those sacred covenants.\
10:48\
You can prepare as a young woman to\
receive the protection and strength\
10:52\
temple covenants give as soon after the\
age of 18 as you are ready\
10:56\
and feel a desire to honor those temple\
covenants.\
11:00\
You who have already received the\
blessings of the temple, don't let\
11:03\
detractors or distractions pull you away\
from eternal truths.\
11:07\
Study and ask trusted sources for\
greater understanding of\
11:11\
the sacred significance of the covenants\
you have made.\
11:14\
Go to the temple as often as you can and\
listen to the Spirit.\
11:18\
You will feel sweet reassurance that you\
are on the Lord's path.\
11:22\
You will find the courage to continue as\
well as to bring others with you.\
11:27\
I testify that as we choose to make\
covenants with Heavenly Father\
11:31\
and access the power of the Savior to\
keep them, we will be blessed with more\
11:36\
happiness in this life than\
we can now imagine\
11:39\
and a glorious eternal life to come.\
11:42\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
