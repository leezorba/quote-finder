Is the plan working?\
0:06\
Recently I had a conversation with a\
young adult who served a mission\
0:12\
several years ago and was now involved\
in his professional work.\
0:18\
In some ways, his life was going well,\
but his faith was in decline.\
0:25\
He was sinking into a sea of doubt about\
the Savior and His Church.\
0:30\
He explained that he wasn't receiving\
the blessings he expected from\
0:34\
the restored gospel.\
0:36\
He didn't feel that the plan of\
happiness was working in his life.\
0:44\
My message today is for all those who\
might have similar feelings.\
0:50\
I speak to those who at one time felt to\
sing the song of redeeming love\
0:57\
but do not feel so now.\
1:01\
Our Heavenly Father has prepared a\
wonderful plan\
1:03\
for our eternal happiness.\
1:06\
But when life does not unfold the way we\
hoped, it might seem that the plan\
1:12\
is not working.\
1:14\
Perhaps we feel the way Jesus's\
disciples felt when they were in\
1:19\
a ship in the "midst of the sea, tossed\
with waves: for the wind\
1:26\
was contrary." Then, very early in the\
morning, "Jesus went unto\
1:33\
them, walking on the sea.\
1:36\
And when the disciples saw him walking\
on the sea, they were troubled, ...\
1:40\
and they cried out for fear.\
1:44\
But straightway Jesus spake unto them,\
saying, Be of good\
1:48\
cheer; it is I; be not afraid.\
1:52\
And Peter answered him and said, Lord,\
if it be thou, bid me come\
1:59\
unto thee on the water.\
2:01\
And he said, Come.\
2:04\
And when Peter was come down out of the\
ship, he walked on the\
2:08\
water, to go to Jesus.\
2:12\
But when he saw the wind boisterous, he\
was afraid;\
2:16\
and beginning to sink, he cried, ...\
Lord, save me.\
2:21\
And immediately Jesus stretched forth\
his hand, and caught him, and said unto\
2:28\
him, O thou of little faith, wherefore\
didst thou doubt?"\
2:35\
Could I share with you three principles\
I learned from Peter?\
2:40\
I pray that these principles might help\
anyone who feels that the plan of\
2:46\
happiness isn't working in their lives.\
2:50\
First, act in faith in Jesus Christ.\
2:55\
I am in awe of Peter's faith at Jesus's\
simple invitation to come.\
3:02\
He left his storm-tossed ship.\
3:04\
He seemed to know that if Jesus Christ\
invited him to do something, he could\
3:09\
do it.\
3:10\
Peter trusted the Savior more than he\
trusted his boat, and that faith gave\
3:16\
him power to act with courage during a\
stressful, frightening situation.\
3:24\
Peter's faith reminds me of an\
experience that I heard from Elder\
3:30\
Jose L.\
3:31\
Alonso.\
3:33\
Shortly after Elder Alonso's son passed\
away leaving a family with young\
3:39\
children, Elder Alonso overheard the\
children talking.\
3:44\
"What are we going to do?" they asked.\
3:48\
A five-year-old daughter answered,\
"Daddy is okay.\
3:54\
He's preaching the gospel of Jesus\
Christ."\
3:59\
Like Peter, this little girl saw beyond\
her challenges and trusted in Jesus\
4:05\
Christ and His Atonement.\
4:08\
Faith in the Savior brings peace and the\
strength to move forward.\
4:15\
If you look back on your life, I believe\
you will see that you have\
4:19\
exercised faith many times.\
4:22\
Joining the Church is an act of faith.\
4:26\
Speaking with Heavenly Father in prayer\
is an act of faith.\
4:31\
Reading the scriptures is an act of\
faith.\
4:34\
Listening to my message in this general\
conference is an act of faith.\
4:42\
As President Russell M.\
4:43\
Nelson has said, "Do not minimize the\
faith you already have." Another\
4:50\
lesson I learned from Peter is this.\
4:54\
In times of trouble, turn to Jesus\
Christ right away.\
5:01\
As He walked toward the Savior, Peter\
was frightened by\
5:04\
the wind and began to sink.\
5:07\
But when Peter realized what was\
happening, he did not try to tread\
5:12\
water on his own swimming back to the\
ship.\
5:15\
Rather than let go of his faith in\
Christ, he held on more\
5:21\
tightly, crying, "Lord, save me.\
5:26\
And immediately Jesus stretched forth\
his hand, and caught him."\
5:32\
All of us face boisterous winds that can\
shake our faith and cause us to sink.\
5:39\
When this happens, please remember that\
Heavenly Father's plan of happiness has\
5:44\
another name- the plan of redemption.\
5:48\
The plan was not for us to glide easily\
through life, never stumbling, never\
5:55\
sinking, with a smile always on our\
face.\
5:59\
Heavenly Father knew that we would need\
to be redeemed.\
6:03\
This is why He prepared the plan of\
redemption.\
6:08\
This is why He sent our Redeemer.\
6:13\
When we struggle for any reason, that\
doesn't mean the plan\
6:17\
isn't working.\
6:19\
That is when we need the plan the most.\
6:25\
In those moments, follow the example of\
Peter.\
6:29\
Turn to the Savior right away.\
6:33\
Now is the time and the day of your\
salvation.\
6:38\
Do not procrastinate the day of your\
repentance.\
6:43\
No matter where we are and where we have\
been, repentance is the way forward.\
6:51\
President Nelson has taught, "Nothing is\
more liberating, more\
6:56\
ennobling, or more crucial to our\
individual progression than is\
7:02\
a regular, daily focus \
on repentance. ...\
7:06\
Whether you are diligently moving along\
the covenant path, have slipped\
7:10\
or stepped from the covenant path, or\
can't even see the path from\
7:16\
where you are now, I plead with you to\
repent.\
7:21\
Experience the strengthening power of\
daily repentance- of doing and being\
7:29\
a little better each day."\
7:34\
Coming unto Christ means more than just\
thinking about Him or talking about Him\
7:40\
or even loving Him.\
7:42\
It means following Him.\
7:45\
It means living the way He teaches us to\
live.\
7:49\
And for all of us, that means repenting\
without delay.\
7:57\
One of my daughters used to work at the\
missionary training center.\
8:02\
She told me of an elder she taught who\
had confided in her that he wasn't sure\
8:10\
the Book of Mormon was true.\
8:12\
He had prayed and prayed for a spiritual\
witness, but he received no answer.\
8:18\
My daughter prayed to know what she\
should do to help this missionary.\
8:24\
The impression she received was that the\
scriptures were not given only\
8:31\
so we can read them and obtain a\
testimony; they were also given to\
8:37\
teach us to keep the commandments of\
God.\
8:41\
My daughter shared this thought with the\
missionary.\
8:47\
Later, she saw this missionary again,\
looking much happier.\
8:52\
He told her that he had finally received\
a testimony that the Book of\
8:56\
Mormon is true.\
8:58\
He knew that this witness came because\
he was making a great effort to\
9:04\
do what the Book of Mormon teaches.\
9:09\
Let us follow Peter's example of turning\
to the Savior during times of trouble.\
9:14\
Follow Jesus Christ instead of relying\
on your own wisdom and strength.\
9:21\
No matter how long you've been trying to\
tread water without Him, it's never\
9:26\
too late to reach out to him.\
9:30\
The plan works.\
9:34\
A third principle I learned from Peter\
and his experience is this: humble\
9:40\
yourself before the Lord, and He will\
lift you up to greater things.\
9:47\
Peter had shown faith both in walking on\
the water and reaching out to\
9:52\
the Savior when he needed help.\
9:54\
Even so, the Savior saw in Peter the\
potential for so much more.\
10:01\
"O thou of little faith," He said,\
"wherefore didst thou doubt?"\
10:07\
Peter could have resented this rebuke.\
10:11\
But he accepted it humbly.\
10:13\
He continued to seek greater faith in\
Jesus Christ.\
10:19\
Through many additional faith-building\
experiences-some of them very, very\
10:23\
difficult- Peter eventually became the\
rock-solid leader the Lord needed\
10:30\
him to be.\
10:32\
He accomplished great things in the\
Lord's service.\
10:37\
What great things does the Lord want you\
to accomplish?\
10:45\
In His Church and kingdom, there are\
many opportunities to serve\
10:49\
and minister to others as the Savior\
did.\
10:53\
He wants you to be part of His great\
work.\
10:57\
Never will the plan of happiness become\
more real to you than when you are\
11:03\
helping others to live it.\
11:07\
While building my own faith, these words\
of Alma were life\
11:12\
changing: "Blessed are they who humble\
themselves without being compelled to\
11:19\
be humble." Let us humbly put ourselves\
in a position where Jesus can lift\
11:26\
us, lead us, and make the most of our\
abilities.\
11:32\
I testify that the plan of happiness\
works.\
11:37\
It was created by your Heavenly Father,\
who loves you.\
11:41\
It works because Jesus Christ overcame\
sin and death through His Atonement.\
11:49\
Come unto Him, follow him, and\
"immediately shall the great plan\
11:53\
of redemption be brought about unto\
you." In the name of Jesus\
11:59\
Christ, amen.\
