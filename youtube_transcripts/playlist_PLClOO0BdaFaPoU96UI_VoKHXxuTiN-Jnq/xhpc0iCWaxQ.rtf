On Friday, October 28, 1588- having lost\
its rudder to being governed\
0:07\
solely by oar- the ship "La Girona,"\
belonging to the great Spanish\
0:13\
Armada, collided with the rocks of\
Lacada Point in Northern Ireland.\
0:18\
The ship capsized.\
0:20\
One of the castaways struggling to\
survive wore a gold ring, given to him\
0:25\
a few months earlier by his wife, with\
the inscription, "I have\
0:32\
nothing more to give you." "I have\
nothing more to give you"-a phrase\
0:38\
and a ring with the design of a hand\
holding a heart, an expression of love\
0:45\
from a wife to her husband.\
0:48\
When I read this story, it made a deep\
impression on me, and I thought of\
0:52\
the request made by the Savior: "And ye\
shall offer for\
0:56\
a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a\
contrite spirit." I also thought\
1:04\
of the people's reaction to King\
Benjamin's words: "Yea, we believe all\
1:10\
the words which thou hast spoken unto\
us; ...which has wrought a mighty\
1:15\
change in us, or in our hearts, that we\
have no more\
1:18\
disposition to do evil but to do good\
continually." Let me share with you\
1:25\
an experience I had when\
I was 12 years old,\
1:28\
the effect of which lasts to this day.\
1:32\
My mother said, "Eduardo, hurry up, we\
are late for the church\
1:38\
meetings." "Mom, I am going to stay with\
dad today," I replied.\
1:44\
"Are you sure?\
1:46\
You have to attend your priesthood\
quorum meeting," she said.\
1:49\
"Poor dad!\
1:51\
He's going to be left alone.\
1:53\
I'm going to stay with him today," I\
said.\
1:57\
Dad was not a member of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints.\
2:03\
My mother and sisters went to Sunday\
meetings, so I went to meet dad in his\
2:06\
workshop where he liked to be on\
Sundays.\
2:09\
And as I had told my mother, I spent a\
while-that is, a few minutes-with\
2:14\
him, and then I asked, "Dad, is\
everything alright?" He kept up his\
2:21\
hobby of repairing radios and clocks,\
and he just smiled at me.\
2:25\
Then I told him, "I'm going to play with\
my friends." Dad, without looking\
2:32\
up, said to me, "Today is Sunday.\
2:36\
Aren’t you supposed to go to church?”\
2:39\
“Yes, but today I told Mom\
I couldn’t go,” I replied.\
2:45\
Dad went on about his business, and for\
me, that was\
2:48\
permission to leave.\
2:50\
That morning there was an important\
soccer game, and my friends had told me\
2:54\
that I couldn't miss it because we had\
to win that game.\
3:00\
My challenge was that I had to pass in\
front of the chapel to get to\
3:04\
the soccer field.\
3:07\
Determined, I dashed toward the soccer\
field and stopped before the great\
3:11\
stumbling block-the chapel.\
3:14\
I ran to the opposite sidewalk where\
there were some big trees, and\
3:19\
I decided to run between them so that no\
one could see me since it was\
3:24\
the time the members were arriving to\
the church meetings.\
3:29\
I arrived just in time for the start of\
the game; I was able to play and go\
3:34\
home before my mother got home.\
3:39\
Everything had gone well; our team had\
won and I was thrilled.\
3:46\
But that well-executed run onto the\
field did not go unnoticed by\
3:51\
the deacons quorum advisor.\
3:54\
Brother Felix Espinoza had seen me\
running quickly from tree to\
3:58\
tree, trying not to be discovered.\
4:02\
At the beginning of the week,\
4:07\
Brother Espinoza came to my house and\
asked to speak with me.\
4:11\
He didn't say anything about what he had\
seen on Sunday, nor did he ask me\
4:15\
why I had missed my meeting.\
4:18\
He just handed me a manual and said, "I\
would like you to teach\
4:22\
the priesthood class on Sunday.\
4:25\
I have marked the lesson for you.\
4:27\
It is not so difficult.\
4:29\
I want you to read it, and I will come\
by in two days to help you with\
4:33\
the preparation for the lesson." Having\
said this, he handed me the manual\
4:38\
and left.\
4:40\
I didn't want to teach the class, but I\
couldn't bring myself to\
4:45\
tell him no.\
4:47\
I had planned that Sunday to stay with\
my father again, meaning there was\
4:52\
another important soccer game.\
4:56\
Brother Espinoza was a person that young\
people admired.\
5:00\
He had found the Restored Gospel and\
changed his life, or in other\
5:04\
words, his heart.\
5:07\
When Saturday afternoon arrived, I\
thought, "Well, maybe\
5:11\
tomorrow I will wake up sick and I won't\
have to go to church." It\
5:18\
wasn't the soccer game that worried me\
anymore; it was a class I had to\
5:24\
teach, especially a lesson about the\
Sabbath day.\
5:31\
Sunday came and I woke up healthier than\
ever.\
5:36\
I had no excuse-no escape.\
5:40\
It was the first time I would teach a\
lesson, but Brother Espinoza was\
5:44\
there by my side.\
5:46\
And that was the day\
5:50\
of a mighty change of heart for me.\
5:52\
From that moment on, I began to keep the\
Sabbath day holy.\
5:54\
And over time, in the words of President\
Russell M Nelson,\
5:59\
the Sabbath day has become a delight.\
6:04\
"Lord, I give you everything; I have\
nothing more to give you." How do we\
6:13\
obtain that mighty change of heart?\
6:16\
It is initiated and eventually occurs:\
When we study the scriptures to\
6:21\
obtain the knowledge that will\
strengthen our faith in Jesus\
6:24\
Christ, which will create a desire to\
change.\
6:29\
When we cultivate our desire through\
prayer and fasting.\
6:34\
When we act, according to the word\
studied or received, and we make\
6:38\
a covenant to surrender\
our hearts to Him,\
6:41\
just as with King Benjamin’s people.\
6:45\
How do we know that our heart is\
changing?\
6:49\
When we want to please God in all\
things.\
6:56\
When we treat others with love, respect,\
and consideration.\
7:04\
When we see that the attributes of\
Christ are becoming\
7:06\
part of our character.\
7:09\
When we feel the guidance of the Holy\
Spirit more constantly.\
7:14\
When we keep a commandment that has been\
difficult for us to obey and then\
7:19\
continue to live it.\
7:21\
When we listen carefully to our leaders'\
advice and cheerfully decide\
7:25\
to follow it, have we not experienced a\
mighty change of heart?\
7:32\
"Lord, I give you everything; I have\
nothing more to give you."\
7:39\
How do we maintain the mighty change?\
7:43\
When we partake of the sacrament weekly\
and renew the covenant to take upon us\
7:48\
the name of Christ, always remember Him,\
and keep His commandments.\
7:55\
When we turn our lives toward the\
temple.\
7:58\
Regular temple attendance will help us\
maintain a new and renewed heart as we\
8:03\
participate in the ordinances.\
8:07\
When we love and serve our neighbors by\
ministering activities and by\
8:13\
missionary work.\
8:16\
Then for our great joy, that inner\
change is strengthened and spreads\
8:21\
until abounds in good works.\
8:23\
This mighty change of heart brings us a\
feeling of freedom, trust,\
8:30\
and peace.\
8:33\
This change of heart is not an event; it\
takes faith,\
8:37\
repentance, and constant spiritual work\
to happen.\
8:41\
It begins when we decide to submit our\
will to the Lord, and it materializes\
8:46\
when we enter into and keep covenants\
with Him.\
8:50\
That individual action has a positive\
effect both on us and on the people\
8:56\
around us.\
8:59\
In the words of President Russell M.\
9:01\
Nelson, "Imagine how quickly the\
devastating conflicts throughout\
9:06\
the world- and those in our individual\
lives-would be quickly resolved if we\
9:12\
all [decided] to follow Jesus Christ and\
heed His teachings." This action of\
9:19\
following the Savior's teachings leads\
to a mighty change of heart.\
9:28\
Dear brothers and sisters, young people\
and children, as we participate in\
9:32\
the conference this weekend, let the\
words of our prophet- which will\
9:37\
come from the Lord- enter our hearts to\
experience a mighty change.\
9:44\
For those who have not yet joined the\
Lord's restored Church, I invite\
9:49\
you to listen to the missionaries with a\
sincere desire to know what God\
9:55\
expects of you and experience that inner\
transformation.\
10:03\
Today is the day to decide to follow the\
Lord Jesus Christ.\
10:10\
"Lord, I give you my heart; I have\
nothing more to give you." Just as\
10:15\
the ring was recovered from that\
shipwreck, when we give our hearts to\
10:20\
God, we are rescued from the raging seas\
of this life.\
10:24\
And in the process, we are refined and\
purified through the Atonement of\
10:29\
Christ and become "children of Christ"\
being spiritually "born of Him." Of\
10:36\
this, I testify in the name of Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
