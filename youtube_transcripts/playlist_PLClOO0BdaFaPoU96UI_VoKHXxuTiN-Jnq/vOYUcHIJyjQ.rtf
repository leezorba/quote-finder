My dear sisters, as we begin this unique\
women's session of General\
0:06\
Conference, I am pleased to deliver this\
introductory message from\
0:11\
the First Presidency.\
0:14\
Our Saturday sessions have a history of\
different purposes\
0:19\
and different audiences.\
0:22\
This evening we add to that history as\
we embark upon a new purpose\
0:27\
and procedure for the foreseeable\
future.\
0:32\
The gospel of Jesus Christ does not\
change.\
0:36\
Gospel doctrine does not change.\
0:39\
Our personal covenants do not change.\
0:43\
But over the years, the meetings we hold\
to communicate our messages do\
0:48\
change and very likely will continue to\
change over the years.\
0:55\
For now, this Saturday evening meeting\
is a session of general\
0:59\
conference, not a session of any\
organization.\
1:05\
Like all sessions of general conference,\
the planning,\
1:09\
speakers, and music are designated by\
the First Presidency.\
1:15\
We have asked President Jean B.\
1:17\
Bingham, President of the Relief\
Society, to conduct this session.\
1:23\
Future Saturday evening sessions may be\
conducted by one of the other general\
1:28\
officers of the Church, such as members\
of the Presidencies of\
1:33\
Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary\
designated by the First Presidency.\
1:41\
Tonight, This Saturday evening session\
of general conference will concentrate\
1:46\
on the concerns of Latter-day Saint\
women.\
1:51\
This will include the doctrine of The\
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
1:55\
Saints, the policies of the Church that\
relate especially to women, and\
2:01\
the general responsibilities and work of\
the organizations that include\
2:06\
the women and girls of the Church.\
2:10\
Though deliberately broadcast to a\
worldwide audience, like all sessions\
2:15\
of general conference, the audience\
invited to be present in\
2:20\
the Conference Center for this session\
is women and girls age 12 and older.\
2:27\
Weâ€™ve included some priesthood leaders\
2:30\
who preside over the participating\
organizations.\
2:34\
What we are initiating here is\
responsive to the communication\
2:38\
resources currently available to the\
Lord's worldwide Church leadership\
2:44\
and membership.\
2:46\
The doctrine of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ is for everyone.\
2:51\
So that is our principal motive and\
extent of dissemination.\
2:57\
We honor the daughters of God in this\
special session by concentrating\
3:02\
on their concerns and those of their\
organizations.\
3:08\
We are grateful that broadcast\
technology now gives church leaders\
3:13\
the capacity to conduct detailed\
training by addressing specific\
3:18\
audiences in the field.\
3:22\
We also welcome the fact that current\
travel opportunities are increasing.\
3:27\
That allows us to send church leaders to\
conduct needed regular face-to-face\
3:33\
leadership training in the field.\
3:37\
This is the work of the Lord Jesus\
Christ.\
3:41\
We are His servants, directed by His\
Holy Spirit.\
3:46\
We invoke the blessings of our Lord upon\
the leaders of these organizations\
3:52\
and upon the faithful women and girls\
who serve the Lord in these\
3:56\
organizations and in their individual\
lives.\
4:02\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
