In 1979, President Spencer W.\
0:03\
Kimball was in the hospital and asked\
his wife Camilla to read his talk to\
0:07\
a general women's meeting.\
0:09\
Much of the major growth that is coming\
to the Church in the last days will\
0:13\
come because many of the good women of\
the world, in whom there is often such\
0:18\
an inner sense of spirituality, will be\
drawn to\
0:22\
the Church in large numbers.\
0:24\
This will happen to the degree that the\
women of the church reflect\
0:28\
righteousness and articulateness in\
their lives.\
0:32\
And to the degree that the women of the\
church are seen as distinct\
0:36\
and different in happy ways from the\
women of the world.\
0:41\
My dear sisters, you, who are our vital\
associates during this winding-up\
0:47\
scene, the day that President Kimball\
foresaw is today.\
0:56\
You are the women he foresaw.\
0:59\
Your virtue, light, love, knowledge,\
courage, character,\
1:07\
faith, and righteous lives will draw\
good women of the world along with\
1:13\
their families to the Church in\
unprecedented numbers.\
1:18\
We need your strength, your conversion,\
your conviction, your\
1:23\
ability to lead, your wisdom, and your\
voices.\
1:28\
The kingdom of God is not and cannot be\
complete without women who make sacred\
1:35\
covenants and then keep them, women who\
can speak with the power and authority\
1:41\
of God.\
1:42\
Whatever your calling, whatever your\
circumstances, we need your\
1:48\
impressions, your insights, and your\
inspiration.\
1:53\
We need you to speak up and speak out in\
ward and stake councils.\
1:59\
We need each married sister to speak as\
a contributing and full partner\
2:04\
as you unite with your husband in\
governing your family.\
2:09\
Married or single, you sisters possess\
distinctive capabilities and special\
2:15\
intuition you have received as gifts\
from God.\
2:19\
We brethren cannot duplicate your unique\
influence.\
2:25\
We know that the culminating act of all\
creation was the creation of woman.\
2:34\
We need your strength.\
2:37\
I thank you, my dear sisters, and bless\
you to rise to your full\
2:44\
stature to fulfill the measure of your\
creation as we walk arm in arm in this\
2:53\
sacred work.\
2:55\
Together, we will help prepare the world\
for the second coming of the Lord.\
