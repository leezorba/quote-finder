My dear brothers and sisters, we have\
been blessed today to hear inspired\
0:06\
servants of God give counsel and\
encouragement.\
0:11\
Each of us, wherever we are, knows that\
we live in increasingly perilous times.\
0:21\
My prayer is that I might help you stand\
steady in the storms we face with\
0:27\
a peaceful heart.\
0:31\
The place to begin is to remember that\
we are each a beloved child of God\
0:39\
and that He has inspired servants.\
0:43\
Those servants of God have foreseen the\
times in which we live.\
0:50\
The Apostle Paul wrote to Timothy: "This\
know also, that in\
0:57\
the last days perilous times shall\
come."\
1:03\
Anyone with eyes to see the signs of the\
times and ears to hear the words of\
1:09\
prophets know that is true.\
1:12\
The perils of greatest danger come to us\
from the forces of wickedness.\
1:21\
Those forces are increasing.\
1:24\
And so it will become more difficult,\
not easier, to honor\
1:28\
the covenants we must make and keep to\
live the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
1:37\
For those of us who are concerned for\
ourselves and for those we\
1:41\
love, there is hope in the promise God\
has made of a place of safety\
1:49\
in the storms ahead.\
1:51\
Here is a word picture of that place.\
1:56\
It has been repeatedly described by\
living prophets.\
2:00\
For example, as recorded in the Book of\
Mormon, an inspired and loving father\
2:07\
told his sons how to strengthen\
themselves to stand steady in\
2:13\
the storms ahead of them, open quote:\
"And now, my sons,\
2:19\
remember, remember that it is upon the\
rock of our Redeemer, who is\
2:26\
Christ, the son of God, that you must\
build your foundation; that when\
2:32\
the devil shall send forth his mighty\
winds, yea, his shafts in\
2:38\
the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail\
and his mighty storm shall beat upon\
2:44\
you, it shall have no power over you to\
drag you down to the gulf of misery\
2:51\
and endless wo, because of the rock upon\
which ye are built, which is\
2:58\
a sure foundation,...whereon if men\
build, they cannot fall."\
3:07\
The misery and endless woe of which he\
spoke are the terrible effects of sins\
3:15\
should we not fully repent of them.\
3:18\
The growing storms are the temptations\
and the increasing attacks of Satan.\
3:27\
It has never been more important than it\
is now to understand how to build\
3:35\
on that sure foundation.\
3:39\
For me, there is no better place to look\
than in the last sermon of King\
3:45\
Benjamin, also recorded in the Book of\
Mormon.\
3:49\
King Benjamin's prophetic words are\
applicable to us in our day.\
3:56\
He knew from his own experience the\
terrors of war.\
4:01\
He had defended his people in combat,\
relying on the power of God.\
4:07\
He saw clearly the terrible powers of\
Lucifer to tempt, to try to\
4:14\
overcome, and discourage God's children.\
4:20\
He invited his people and us to build on\
the only sure rock of\
4:27\
safety, who is the Savior.\
4:32\
He made clear that we are free to choose\
between right and wrong\
4:37\
and that we cannot avoid the\
consequences of our choices.\
4:42\
He spoke directly and sharply because he\
knew what sorrow would come\
4:49\
to those who might not heed his\
warnings.\
4:54\
Here is how he described the\
consequences that follow our choice\
5:01\
either to follow the promptings of the\
Spirit or to follow the evil\
5:05\
messages that come from Satan, whose\
intent is to tempt and destroy us.\
5:16\
Open quote: "For behold, there is a wo\
pronounced upon him who listeth to obey\
5:24\
that [evil] spirit; for if he listeth to\
obey him, and remaineth and diet in\
5:32\
his sins, the same drinketh damnation to\
his own soul; for he receiveth\
5:41\
for his wages an everlasting punishment,\
having transgressed\
5:47\
the law of God contrary to his own\
knowledge.\
5:51\
...\
5:52\
Therefore, if that man repenteth not and\
remaineth and dieth an enemy to\
5:59\
God, the demands of divine justice do\
awaken his immortal soul to a lively\
6:08\
sense of his own guilt, which doth cause\
him to shrink from the presence\
6:16\
of the Lord, and doth fill his breast\
with guilt, and pain, and\
6:22\
anguish, which is like an unquenchable\
fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever\
6:31\
and ever." Close quote.\
6:33\
King Benjamin went on to say, "O, all ye\
old men, and also ye young\
6:40\
men, and you little children who can\
understand my words, for I have spoken\
6:47\
plainly unto you that you might\
understand, I pray that ye should awake\
6:54\
to a remembrance of the awful situation\
of those that have fallen into\
6:59\
transgression," close quote.\
7:03\
For me, the power of that warning to\
repent forms in my mind a picture of\
7:12\
the sure time when you and I will stand\
before the Savior, after this life.\
7:23\
We want with all our hearts not to\
shrink but rather to look up at\
7:29\
Him, and see Him smile, and hear Him\
say, "Well done, thou good\
7:37\
and faithful servant:...\
7:39\
enter [in]," close quote.\
7:42\
King Benjamin makes it clear how we can\
receive the hope to hear those words if\
7:51\
we find the way in this life to have our\
natures changed through\
7:56\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
8:00\
That is the only way we build on the\
sure foundation and so stand firm\
8:08\
during the storms of temptations and\
trials ahead.\
8:14\
King Benjamin describes that change in\
our natures with a beautiful metaphor\
8:21\
that has always touched my heart.\
8:25\
It was used by prophets for millennia\
and by the Lord Himself.\
8:31\
It is this: we must become as a child-a\
little child.\
8:40\
Now for some, that will not be easy to\
accept.\
8:44\
Most of us want to be strong.\
8:47\
You may well see being like a child as\
being weak.\
8:52\
In fact, most parents look for the day\
when their children act less childish.\
8:58\
But King Benjamin, who understood as\
well as any mortal what it meant to\
9:03\
be a man of strength and courage, makes\
it clear that to be like\
9:09\
a child is not to be childish.\
9:14\
It is to be like the Savior who prayed\
to His Father for strength to be able\
9:22\
to do His Father's will and atone\
9:26\
for the sins of all of \
His Fatherâ€™s children.\
9:31\
And then did it.\
9:34\
Our natures must be changed to become as\
a child to gain the strength we must\
9:43\
have to stand steady and at peace in\
times of peril.\
9:51\
Here is King Benjamin's stirring\
description of how that change\
9:56\
comes, open quote: "For the natural man\
is an enemy to God, and has been from\
10:03\
the fall of Adam, and will be, forever\
and ever, unless he yields to\
10:10\
the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and\
putteth off the natural man\
10:16\
and becometh a saint through the\
atonement of Christ the\
10:20\
Lord, and becometh as a child,\
submissive, meek, humble,\
10:30\
patient, full of love, willing to submit\
to all things which the Lord\
10:37\
seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a\
child doth submit to his\
10:44\
father," close quote.\
10:47\
We receive that change as we make and\
renew covenants with God.\
10:55\
That brings the power of Christ's\
Atonement to allow that transformation\
11:00\
in our hearts.\
11:02\
We can feel it every time we partake of\
the sacrament, perform a temple\
11:09\
ordinance for a departed ancestor,\
testify as a witness of\
11:16\
the Savior, or care for someone in need\
as Christ's disciples.\
11:25\
In those experiences, we become over\
time like a child in our capacity to\
11:33\
love and obey.\
11:38\
We come then to stand on the sure\
foundation.\
11:43\
Our faith in Jesus Christ\
brings us to repentance\
11:48\
and to keeping His\
commandments.\
11:51\
We obey, and we gain power to resist\
temptation, and we gain the promised\
12:00\
companionship of the Holy Ghost.\
12:05\
Our natures change to become as a little\
child, obedient to God\
12:13\
and more loving.\
12:15\
That change will qualify us to enjoy the\
gifts that come through the Holy Ghost.\
12:23\
Having the Spirit's companionship will\
comfort, guide, and strengthen us.\
12:30\
I have come to know some of what King\
Benjamin meant when he said that we\
12:37\
could become like a little child before\
God.\
12:42\
I have learned from many experiences\
that the Holy Ghost speaks most often\
12:48\
in a quiet voice, heard most easily when\
one's heart is meek\
12:56\
and submissive like that of a child.\
13:01\
In fact, the prayer that works is "I\
only want what you want.\
13:06\
Just tell me what that is.\
13:08\
I'll do it." When the storms in life\
come, you can be steady because you are\
13:15\
standing on the rock of your faith in\
Jesus Christ.\
13:21\
That faith will lead you to daily\
repentance\
13:25\
and consistent covenant keeping.\
13:29\
Then you will always remember Him.\
13:33\
And through the storms of hatred and\
wickedness, you will feel steady\
13:40\
and hopeful.\
13:42\
More than that, you will find yourself\
reaching out to lift others to safety\
13:48\
on the rock with you.\
13:51\
Faith in Jesus Christ always leads to\
greater hope and to feelings of charity\
13:58\
towards others, which is the true love\
of Christ.\
14:05\
I bear you, my solemn witness, that the\
Lord Jesus Christ has given you\
14:12\
personally the invitation to Come unto\
Him.\
14:17\
He invites you, out of love for you and\
for those you love, to come to Him\
14:24\
for peace in this life and eternal life\
in the world to come.\
14:31\
He knows perfectly the storms you will\
face in your test as part of the plan\
14:39\
of happiness.\
14:41\
I plead with you to accept the Savior's\
invitation.\
14:47\
Like a meek and loving child, accept His\
help.\
14:53\
Make and keep the covenants He offers in\
The Church of Jesus Christ of\
15:00\
Latter-day Saints.\
15:03\
They will strengthen you.\
15:06\
The Savior knows the storms and the\
places of safety on your way home\
15:13\
to Him and to His Heavenly Father.\
15:17\
He knows the way.\
15:20\
He is the way.\
15:22\
I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
