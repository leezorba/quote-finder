With that wonderful music ringing in our\
ears, I direct my remarks today to\
0:07\
the young people of the Church, meaning\
anyone President\
0:12\
Nelson's age or younger.\
0:18\
I seldom use visuals, but I can't resist\
sharing this one.\
0:34\
This cree decor comes from my eight-\
year-old friend, Marin Arnold, written\
0:41\
when she was seven.\
0:43\
I will translate for you her early\
reformed Egyptian:\
0:50\
“Dear Bishop, general conference\
was boring.\
0:56\
Why do we have to do it?\
0:59\
Tell me why.\
1:02\
Sincerely, Marin Arnold.”\
Well, Marin, the talk I’m about to give\
1:08\
will undoubtedly disappoint you again.\
1:13\
But when you write your bishop to\
complain, it's important that you tell\
1:17\
him my name is Kearon,\
Elder Patrick Kearon.\
1:29\
For nearly two years, a pandemic of\
biblical proportions\
1:34\
has enveloped our planet.\
1:37\
And while that plague brought a halt to\
almost everything socially, obviously\
1:43\
it did not bring a halt to brutality,\
violence, and cruel\
1:48\
aggression politically, nationally, or\
internationally.\
1:54\
As if that were not enough, we're still\
facing long-standing social\
1:59\
and cultural challenges ranging from\
economic deprivation to environmental\
2:06\
desecration to racial inequity and more.\
2:12\
Such winds and dark days can be\
discouraging to the youth among\
2:17\
us, those to whom we look for optimism\
and enthusiasm regarding the tomorrows\
2:23\
of our lives.\
2:26\
It's been said that the power of youth\
2:28\
is the commonwealth \
for the entire world.\
2:32\
The young are the faces of our future.\
2:36\
Furthermore, our children are the\
trustees into whose hands\
2:40\
the destiny of this Church will one day\
be placed.\
2:45\
Given our current times, it's\
understandable if the idealism of\
2:50\
the young is waning a little.\
2:54\
Dr. Laurie Santos, a professor at Yale\
University, recently created a class\
3:00\
titled “Psychology and the Good Life.”\
3:04\
The first year the class was offered,\
3:08\
nearly one quarter of the entire\
undergraduate student body enrolled.\
3:15\
Over 64 million people\
then visited her podcast.\
3:22\
Writing about this phenomenon, one\
journalist noted how painful it is to\
3:27\
see so many bright young students and\
adults desperately looking\
3:33\
for something they’ve lost or,\
worse yet,\
3:38\
longing for something they never had.\
3:41\
My plea today to our youth and to you\
parents and adults who advise them is\
3:49\
to begin your search for happiness by\
embracing the bounty we've already\
3:54\
received from the Giver of every good\
gift.\
3:59\
At precisely the moment many in the\
world are asking deep questions of\
4:04\
the soul, we ought to be answering\
with the good news\
4:09\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
4:12\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints, which holds aloft\
4:17\
the mission and message of the Savior of\
the world, offers the most eternally\
4:24\
significant way to both find good and do\
good at such a needful time.\
4:32\
President Russell M.\
4:33\
Nelson has said of this generation that\
they have more capacity to have more\
4:41\
impact for good on this world than any\
previous generation.\
4:47\
We of all people should be singing the\
song of redeeming love.\
4:54\
But that takes discipline, discipleship,\
if you will- essentially\
4:59\
the same word- the kind that guards\
against negative attitudes\
5:05\
and destructive habits that would pull\
us off key as we try to sing that song\
5:12\
of eternal salvation.\
5:15\
Even as we stay on the sunny side of the\
street, we do run into that fellow\
5:20\
from time to time who’s determined to\
5:22\
find something bleak and \
dismal about everything.\
5:27\
You know his motto "It's always darkest\
just before it goes pitch black." What\
5:34\
a malignant vision and what a miserable\
existence.\
5:39\
Yes, we might sometimes want to run away\
from where we are, but we can\
5:45\
never run away from who we are- children\
of the living God, who loves\
5:51\
us, who is always ready to forgive us\
and will never, ever forsake us.\
6:01\
You are His most precious possession.\
6:06\
You are His child, to whom He has given\
prophets and promises, spiritual gifts\
6:13\
and revelations, miracles and messages,\
and angels on both sides\
6:18\
of the veil.\
6:20\
He's also given you a church that\
strengthens families for mortality\
6:25\
and binds them together for eternity.\
6:28\
It provides more than 31,000 wards and\
branches, where people gather\
6:34\
and sing and fast and pray for each\
other and give their means to\
6:38\
the poor.\
6:40\
This is where every person is named,\
accounted for, and ministered to\
6:46\
and where lay friends and neighbors\
voluntarily serve each other in\
6:51\
callings that range from clerical work\
to custodial duty.\
6:56\
Young adults serve missions by the\
thousands-senior couples as well-\
7:01\
at their own expense, with no say\
whatsoever as to where they'll labor.\
7:07\
And members, young and old, trundle off\
to temples to perform sacred ordinances\
7:13\
necessary to bind the human family\
together- a bold activity\
7:19\
in such a divided world, but one which\
declares that such divisiveness\
7:25\
is only temporary.\
7:29\
These are a few of the reasons we give\
for the hope that is in us.\
7:36\
Of course, in our present day,\
tremendously difficult issues face any\
7:41\
disciple of Jesus Christ.\
7:45\
The leaders of this Church are giving\
their lives\
7:52\
to seeking the Lord's guidance in the\
resolution of these challenges.\
7:59\
If some are not resolved to the\
satisfaction of everyone, perhaps\
8:05\
they constitute part of the cross that\
Jesus said we'd have to take up in\
8:11\
order to follow Him.\
8:14\
It's precisely because there would be\
dark days and difficult issues that God\
8:21\
promised He would out of a cloud by day\
and a pillar of fire by night guide\
8:28\
prophets, give an iron rod, open a\
narrow gate leading to a straight\
8:33\
path, and above all, grant us the power\
to finish the course.\
8:40\
So please, please stay for the whole\
feast, even if you're not sure about\
8:45\
the broccoli.\
8:47\
Bask in His light, and lend your candle\
to the cause.\
8:53\
They have it right in Primary; Jesus\
really does want you for a sunbeam.\
9:00\
When the Jewish leader Jairus plead for\
Jesus to heal his 12-year-old\
9:05\
daughter, who lay dying at home, the\
surrounding crowd waylaid\
9:12\
the Savior so long that a servant soon\
came saying to this anxious\
9:18\
father, "Thy daughter is dead; trouble\
not the Master.\
9:28\
But when Jesus heard it, he answered\
him, saying, Fear\
9:35\
not: believe only,\
9:38\
and she shall be made whole." And she\
was.\
9:43\
And so will you.\
9:45\
"Fear not: believe only."\
9:52\
Because each of you in this audience is\
precious to God and to this\
9:56\
Church, I close with this special\
apostolic declaration.\
10:02\
Before you ever received the gift of the\
Holy Ghost, you had the light of\
10:06\
Christ planted in your soul.\
10:09\
That light, which is in all things,\
giveth life to all things\
10:15\
and is the influence for good in the\
hearts of all people who have ever\
10:19\
lived or ever will live.\
10:22\
That light was given to protect you and\
to teach you.\
10:27\
One of its central messages is that life\
is the most precious of all\
10:31\
gifts, a gift which is obtained\
eternally only through the Atonement of\
10:36\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
10:38\
And the Light and Life of the World, the\
Only Begotten Son of God\
10:43\
came to give us life by conquering\
death.\
10:48\
We must commit ourselves fully to that\
gift of life and run to the aid of\
10:55\
those who are at risk of giving up this\
sacred gift.\
11:00\
Leaders, advisers, friends, family,\
watch for signs of\
11:06\
depression, despair, or anything hinting\
of self-harm.\
11:13\
Offer your help.\
11:14\
Listen.\
11:15\
Make some kind of intervention as\
appropriate.\
11:19\
And to any of our youth out there\
struggling, whatever your concerns\
11:24\
or difficulties, death by suicide is\
manifestly not the answer.\
11:33\
It will not relieve the \
pain you are feeling\
11:36\
or that you see \
yourself causing.\
11:40\
In a world that so desperately needs all\
the light it can get, please do not\
11:48\
minimize the eternal light God put in\
your soul before this world was.\
11:57\
Talk to someone.\
11:59\
Ask for help.\
12:01\
Do not destroy a life that Christ gave\
His life to preserve.\
12:09\
You can bear the struggles\
of this mortal life\
12:11\
because we’ll help you bear them.\
12:14\
You're stronger than you think.\
12:18\
Help is available from others and\
especially from God.\
12:24\
You are loved and valued and needed.\
12:27\
We need you.\
12:28\
Fear not, and believe only.\
12:32\
Someone who faced circumstances far more\
desperate than you and I ever will\
12:37\
once cried, "Go forward," my beloved\
young friends.\
12:42\
“Courage... ; and on, on to the victory!\
12:47\
Let your hearts rejoice, and be\
exceedingly glad.”\
12:52\
We have so much to be glad about.\
12:57\
We have each other, and we have Him.\
13:01\
Do not deny us the chance to have you, I\
plead in the sacred and holy\
13:10\
name of the Lord Jesus Christ, our\
Master, amen.\
