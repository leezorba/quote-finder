For just over three years now, we have\
been on a journey together as members\
0:05\
of the Lord's Church.\
0:07\
It was October 2018 when the First\
Presidency and the Quorum of\
0:11\
the Twelve Apostles invited us to learn\
of Jesus Christ by studying\
0:16\
the scriptures in a new and inspiring\
fashion with the "Come, Follow Me"\
0:20\
resource as our guide.\
0:22\
On any journey, it's good to pause\
occasionally to assess our progress\
0:27\
and to make sure we're still moving\
toward our goal.\
0:31\
Consider this profound statement from\
the introduction to "Come, Follow\
0:34\
Me": "The aim of all gospel learning and\
teaching is to deepen our\
0:40\
conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus\
Christ…The kind of gospel\
0:45\
learning that strengthens our faith and\
leads to the miracle of conversion\
0:49\
doesn't happen all at once.\
0:50\
It extends beyond our classroom, into\
our hearts, and into\
0:54\
our homes.\
0:55\
It requires consistent daily efforts to\
understand and live the gospel.\
1:00\
Gospel learning that leads to true\
conversion requires the influence of\
1:05\
the Holy Ghost." That is the miracle we\
seek when one person has an experience\
1:11\
in the scriptures, and that experience\
is blessed by the influence of\
1:15\
the Holy Ghost.\
1:17\
Such experiences are precious foundation\
stones for our conversion to\
1:21\
the Savior.\
1:22\
And as President Russell M.\
1:23\
Nelson recently reminded us,\
1:25\
spiritual foundations must\
be constantly reinforced.\
1:29\
Long-lasting conversion\
is a lifelong process.\
1:33\
Conversion is our goal.\
1:36\
To be most effective, your experiences\
with the scriptures must be your own.\
1:42\
Reading or hearing about another\
person's experiences and insights can\
1:47\
be helpful, but that won't bring the\
same converting power.\
1:51\
There is no substitute for the time you\
spend in the scriptures hearing\
1:56\
the Holy Ghost speak directly to you.\
2:00\
Each week when I open my "Come, Follow\
Me" manual, I write this\
2:03\
question at the top of the page.\
2:05\
"What is the Holy Ghost teaching me this\
week as I read these chapters?" As\
2:11\
I study the scriptures, I ponder that\
question over and over again,\
2:15\
and without fail, spiritual\
impressions come\
2:18\
and I make note of them in my manual.\
2:21\
Now, how do I know when the Holy Ghost\
is teaching me?\
2:25\
Well, it usually happens in small and\
simple ways.\
2:28\
Sometimes the passage of scripture will\
2:30\
seem to jump off the page\
to my attention.\
2:33\
At other times, I feel like my mind is\
enlightened with a broader\
2:37\
understanding of a gospel principle.\
2:40\
I also feel the influence of the Holy\
Ghost when my wife, Anne\
2:43\
Marie, and I talk about what we're\
reading.\
2:46\
Her perspectives always invite the\
Spirit.\
2:50\
This year we are studying the Old\
Testament, sacred scripture that fills\
2:54\
our souls with light.\
2:56\
While reading the Old Testament, it\
feels like I'm spending\
2:59\
time with trusted guides: Adam, Eve,\
Enoch, Noah,\
3:04\
Abraham, and so many others.\
3:06\
This week, while studying Exodus\
chapters 7–13, we learn how the Lord\
3:11\
freed the children of Israel from\
centuries of captivity in Egypt.\
3:16\
We read about nine plagues, nine\
impressive manifestations of God's\
3:20\
power that Pharaoh witnessed without\
softening his heart.\
3:25\
Then the Lord told his prophet Moses\
about a 10th plague and how each family\
3:30\
in Israel could prepare for it.\
3:32\
As part of a ritual they would call the\
Passover, the Israelites were to\
3:37\
sacrifice a male lamb, one without\
blemish.\
3:41\
Then they were to mark the door frames\
of their homes with the blood of\
3:45\
the lamb.\
3:46\
The Lord promised that all the homes\
that were marked with the blood would\
3:50\
be protected from the terrible plague\
that was about to come.\
3:54\
The scriptures say, "And the children of\
Israel…did as the Lord…commanded\
3:59\
Moses." There's something very powerful\
in that simple statement of obedience.\
4:05\
Because the children of Israel followed\
the counsel of Moses and acted in\
4:09\
faith, they were saved from\
the plague and, in time,\
4:13\
freed from their captivity.\
4:15\
So what did the Holy Ghost teach me in\
these chapters this week?\
4:20\
Here are a few thoughts that have rested\
on my mind.\
4:24\
The Lord works through His Prophet to\
protect and save His people.\
4:30\
The faith and humility to follow the\
prophet preceded the miracle of\
4:33\
protection and deliverance.\
4:36\
The blood on the doorframe was an\
outward sign of inward faith in\
4:42\
Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.\
4:45\
I am impressed with the parallel between\
the way the Lord blessed His\
4:49\
people in this Old Testament account and\
the way He's also blessing His\
4:53\
people today.\
4:55\
When the Lord's living prophet President\
Nelson, introduced us to\
4:58\
"Come, Follow Me" as a means of studying\
the scriptures, he invited us\
5:02\
to transform our homes into sanctuaries\
of faith and centers of gospel learning.\
5:07\
Then he promised four specific\
blessings.\
5:12\
One, your Sabbath days will be a\
delight.\
5:15\
Two, your children will be excited to\
learn and live the Savior's teachings.\
5:20\
Three, the influence of the adversary in\
your life and in your home will\
5:25\
decrease, and four, these changes in\
your family will be dramatic\
5:31\
and sustaining.\
5:33\
Now, we don't have any journal entries\
from those who experience the Passover\
5:38\
with Moses in Egypt.\
5:40\
However, we do have many testimonials\
from Saints who with equal\
5:44\
faith, are following President Nelson's\
counsel today and receiving\
5:49\
the promised blessings.\
5:50\
Here are a few such testimonials.\
5:53\
A mother of a young family said, "We\
talk of Christ and we rejoice\
5:58\
in Christ in our home.\
6:00\
To me, that is the greatest blessing\
that my children can grow up with these\
6:04\
gospel conversations in the home that\
bring them closer to the Savior." A\
6:09\
senior brother called his study of the\
scriptures through "Come, Follow\
6:13\
Me" "a conduit filled with divine light\
that helps us see gospel doctrine that\
6:18\
is necessary for our spiritual\
well-being." A young wife described\
6:22\
the blessings in her marriage.\
6:25\
"I have been able to know my husband's\
heart more deeply, and I have been able\
6:30\
to open my heart more to him as we study\
together." A mother of a large\
6:35\
family, noticed how her efforts to teach\
her family changed.\
6:38\
She mentioned, looking back, "it was\
like I was playing the piano with snow\
6:43\
gloves on.\
6:44\
I was going through the motions, but the\
music wasn't quite right.\
6:48\
Now the gloves are off, and while my\
music still isn't perfect, I hear\
6:52\
the difference.\
6:53\
"Come, Follow Me" has given me vision,\
ability, focus, and purpose." A\
6:58\
young husband said, "My most important\
priorities at home have become more\
7:03\
clear since I've made "Come, Follow Me"\
a regular part of my mornings.\
7:07\
Studying leads me to think more about\
the things that matter most to\
7:11\
me, like the temple, my relationship\
with my wife, my calling.\
7:16\
And I'm grateful that my home is a\
sanctuary where God comes first." A\
7:23\
sister shared, "My daily experiences\
with "Come, Follow Me" are rarely\
7:27\
noteworthy, but over time I can see how\
I am being changed by such a\
7:31\
constant, focused study of the\
Scriptures.\
7:34\
That kind of study humbles me, teaches\
me and changes me a little at a time."\
7:40\
A returned missionary reported, "The\
"Come, Follow Me"\
7:43\
program has gotten me closer to the\
level of scripture study that\
7:46\
I did on my mission, and I have been\
able to move from a checklist mentality\
7:50\
of scripture study to truly enriching\
sessions of getting to know God." A\
7:57\
brother said, "I feel the Holy Ghost\
welcomed more into my life and feel\
8:02\
God's revelatory guidance in making\
decisions.\
8:06\
I have more profound conversations\
regarding the beauty in the simple\
8:10\
doctrine of Christ and His Atonement." A\
seven-year-old child shared, "I'm\
8:16\
getting baptized soon, and "Come, Follow\
Me" is getting me ready.\
8:20\
My family and I talk about baptism and I\
8:22\
don’t feel nervous about\
getting baptized.\
8:25\
Now "Come, Follow Me" helps me and the\
Holy Ghost come into my heart.\
8:30\
And I feel warm when I read the\
scriptures." And then\
8:34\
finally, from a mother of several\
children, "As we study the word of\
8:39\
God, He has helped our family move from\
concern to power, from trial\
8:46\
and challenge to deliverance, and from\
contention and criticism to love\
8:52\
and peace, and from the adversary's\
influence to God's influence." These\
8:58\
and many other faithful followers of\
Christ have symbolically placed\
9:02\
the blood of the Lamb of God on the\
entrance to their homes.\
9:05\
They are demonstrating their inward\
commitment to follow the Savior.\
9:09\
Their faith precedes the miracle.\
9:11\
It's the miracle of one person having an\
experience in the scriptures\
9:16\
and that experience being blessed by the\
influence of the Holy Ghost.\
9:20\
When we study the scriptures, there is\
no spiritual famine in the land.\
9:25\
As Nephi said, "Whoso would hearken to\
the word of God and would hold fast\
9:29\
unto it, they would never perish;\
neither could the temptations\
9:33\
and the fiery darts of the adversary\
overpowered them unto blindness to lead\
9:37\
them away to destruction." In ancient\
times, as the children of Israel\
9:41\
followed the Lord's direction given\
through the prophet Moses, they were\
9:45\
blessed with safety and freedom.\
9:47\
Today, as we follow the Lord's direction\
given through our living\
9:50\
prophet, President Nelson, we are\
equally blessed with conversion in our\
9:54\
hearts and protection in our homes.\
9:56\
I testified that Jesus Christ lives.\
9:58\
This is His church, restored through the\
Prophet Joseph Smith.\
10:02\
Russell M.\
Nelson is the Lord’s prophet today.\
10:05\
I love and sustain him in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
