Brothers and sisters, at this glorious\
Easter season, we are so blessed to\
0:06\
meet and receive counsel and direction\
from God's servants.\
0:11\
Sacred guidance and teachings from our\
Heavenly Father help us navigate life\
0:17\
in these perilous times.\
0:20\
As was prophesied, "fires and\
tempests,...wars, rumors of\
0:25\
wars, and earthquakes in divers\
places...\
0:29\
and all manner of abominations,"\
"plague," "famines\
0:33\
and pestilences" are ravaging families,\
communities, and even nations.\
0:41\
There is another scourge sweeping the\
globe: attacks on your and my\
0:46\
religious freedom.\
0:49\
This growing sentiment seeks to remove\
religion and faith in God from\
0:54\
the public square, schools, community\
standards, and civic discourse.\
1:01\
Opponents of religious freedom seek to\
impose restrictions on expressions of\
1:07\
heartfelt convictions.\
1:10\
They even criticize and ridicule faith\
traditions.\
1:16\
Such an attitude marginalizes people,\
devaluing personal\
1:21\
principles, fairness, respect,\
spirituality, and peace of conscience.\
1:28\
What is religious freedom?\
1:31\
It is freedom of worship in all its\
configurations: freedom of\
1:36\
assembly, freedom of speech, freedom to\
act on personal beliefs, and freedom\
1:43\
for others to do the same.\
1:46\
Religious freedom allows each of us to\
decide for ourselves what we\
1:50\
believe, how we live and act according\
to our faith and what God expects of us.\
1:59\
Efforts to curtail such religious\
liberty are not new.\
2:04\
Throughout history, people of faith have\
suffered mightily\
2:08\
at the hands of\
others.\
2:10\
Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of\
Latter- day Saints are no different.\
2:16\
From our beginnings, many seeking God\
were drawn to this Church because of\
2:21\
its teachings of divine doctrine,\
including faith in Jesus\
2:26\
Christ and His Atonement, repentance,\
the plan of\
2:30\
happiness, and the Second Coming of our\
Lord.\
2:35\
Opposition, persecution, and violence\
plagued our first latter-day\
2:40\
Prophet, Joseph Smith, and his\
followers.\
2:44\
Amidst the turmoil in 1842, Joseph\
published 13 fundamental tenets of\
2:51\
the growing Church, including this one:\
"We claim the privilege of\
2:56\
worshiping Almighty God according to the\
dictates of our own\
3:00\
conscience, and allow all men the same\
privilege, let them worship\
3:05\
how, where, or what they may." His\
statement is inclusive,\
3:12\
liberating, and respectful.\
3:14\
That is the essence of religious\
freedom.\
3:18\
The Prophet Joseph Smith also stated,\
quote, "I am bold to declare\
3:24\
before heaven that I am just as ready to\
die in defending the rights of\
3:29\
a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man\
of any other denomination; for\
3:36\
the same principle which would trample\
upon the rights of...the Saints would\
3:41\
trample upon the rights of the Roman\
Catholics, or any other denomination\
3:47\
who may be unpopular and too weak to\
defend themselves.\
3:52\
It is love of liberty that inspires my\
soul, civic and religious liberty to\
3:58\
the whole of the human race," close\
quote.\
4:03\
Still, early Church members were\
attacked and driven thousands of miles\
4:09\
from New York to Ohio to Missouri, where\
the governor issued\
4:13\
an order that members of the Church,\
quote, "Must be treated\
4:17\
as enemies and must be exterminated or\
driven from the state," close quote.\
4:25\
They fled to Illinois, but the torment\
continued.\
4:29\
A mob murdered the Prophet Joseph,\
thinking that killing him would\
4:32\
destroy the Church and scatter the\
believers.\
4:36\
But the faithful held firm.\
4:39\
Joseph's successor, Brigham Young, led\
thousands in a forced exodus\
4:44\
1,300 miles west to what is now the\
state of Utah.\
4:51\
My own ancestors were amongst those\
early pioneer settlers.\
4:57\
From those days of intense persecution,\
the Lord's Church has\
5:01\
grown steadily to nearly 17 million\
members, with well over half living\
5:07\
outside the United States.\
5:10\
In April 2020, our Church celebrated the\
200th anniversary of\
5:16\
the Restoration of the gospel with a\
proclamation to the world prepared by\
5:22\
our First Presidency and Quorum of the\
Twelve Apostles.\
5:26\
It begins, "We solemnly proclaim that\
God loves His children in every nation\
5:34\
of the world." Our beloved prophet,\
Russell M.\
5:38\
Nelson, has further expressed, "We\
believe in freedom, kindness,\
5:44\
and fairness for all of God's children.\
5:47\
We are all brothers and sisters, each\
one a child of a loving\
5:52\
Father in heaven.\
5:54\
His son, the Lord Jesus Christ, invites\
all to come unto Him.\
5:59\
Black and white, bond and free, male and\
female." Consider with\
6:06\
me four ways\
6:07\
that society and individuals benefit\
6:09\
from religious freedom.\
6:12\
First, religious freedom honors the\
first and second great\
6:18\
commandments, placing God at the center\
of our lives.\
6:22\
We read in Matthew, "Thou shalt love the\
Lord thy God with all thy heart\
6:28\
and with all thy soul and with all thy\
mind.\
6:31\
...And the second is liken unto it.\
6:34\
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as\
thyself." Whether in a\
6:38\
chapel, synagogue, mosque, or tin-roof\
hut, Christ's disciples and all\
6:46\
like-minded believers can express\
devotion to God by worship of Him\
6:52\
and willingness to serve His children.\
6:55\
Jesus Christ is the perfect example of\
such love and service.\
7:00\
During His ministry, He cared for the\
poor, healed the sick and\
7:04\
the blind.\
7:05\
He fed the hungry, opened His arms to\
little children, and forgave those who\
7:11\
wronged Him, even crucified Him.\
7:14\
The scriptures describe that Jesus went\
about doing good.\
7:19\
So must we.\
7:21\
Second, religious freedom fosters\
expressions of belief, hope,\
7:27\
and peace.\
7:29\
As a Church, we join with other\
religions protecting people of all\
7:34\
faiths and persuasions and their right\
to speak their convictions.\
7:39\
This does not mean we accept their\
beliefs, nor they ours.\
7:43\
But we have more in common than we have\
with those who desire to silence us.\
7:51\
I recently represented the Church at the\
annual G20 Interfaith Forum in Italy.\
7:58\
I was encouraged, even buoyed up, when I\
met with government\
8:02\
and faith leaders from around the world.\
8:05\
I realized wounds and differences can be\
resolved and even healed when we\
8:11\
honor God, the Father of us all, and\
Jesus Christ, His Son.\
8:17\
The great Healer of all is our Lord and\
Savior Jesus Christ.\
8:22\
I had an interesting moment as I closed\
my talk.\
8:26\
The previous seven speakers had not\
closed in any manner of a faith\
8:30\
tradition or in the name of God.\
8:33\
As I spoke, I thought, "Do I just say\
thank you and sit down, or do I close\
8:41\
'In the name of Jesus Christ'?" I\
remembered who I was and I knew\
8:47\
the Lord would have me say His name to\
conclude my message.\
8:52\
So I did.\
8:54\
Looking back, it was my opportunity to\
express my belief and I had\
9:00\
the freedom of religion to bear my\
witness of His holy name.\
9:06\
Third, religion inspires people to help\
others.\
9:11\
When religion is given the space and\
freedom to flourish, believers\
9:16\
perform simple and sometimes heroic acts\
of service.\
9:23\
The ancient Jewish phrase "tikkun olam,"\
meaning "to repair or heal\
9:29\
the world," is being reflected today in\
the efforts of so many.\
9:35\
We have partnered with Catholic\
Charities known as Caritas\
9:39\
International, Islamic Relief, and any\
number of Jewish, Hindu,\
9:44\
Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian\
organizations like the Salvation Army\
9:49\
and the National Christian Foundation.\
9:53\
Together, we serve millions in need,\
most recently by aiding refugees\
9:58\
of war with tents, sleeping bags, and\
food supplies, and providing\
10:04\
vaccinations, including polio and COVID.\
10:08\
The list of what is being done is long,\
but so are the needs.\
10:13\
No question, people of faith working\
together\
10:17\
can make significant\
interventions.\
10:21\
At the same time, one-on-one service is\
often\
10:25\
unheralded but quietly changes\
lives.\
10:29\
I think of the example in Luke when\
Jesus Christ reached out to the widow\
10:34\
of Nain.\
10:35\
Jesus, accompanied by a group of\
followers, came upon the burial\
10:39\
procession of the widow's only son.\
10:42\
Without him, she was facing emotional,\
spiritual, and even\
10:46\
financial ruin.\
10:48\
Jesus, seeing her tear-stained face,\
said, "Weep not." Then he touched\
10:54\
the bier carrying the body and the\
procession halted.\
10:58\
"Young man," He commanded, "I say unto\
thee, Arise.\
11:02\
And he that was dead sat up, and began\
to speak.\
11:06\
And [Jesus] delivered him to his\
mother." Raising the dead is\
11:11\
a miracle, but every act of kindness and\
concern for someone struggling is\
11:16\
the covenant way.\
11:17\
Each of us can also go about doing good,\
knowing God is with us.\
11:23\
And fourth, freedom of religion acts as\
a unifying and rallying force\
11:29\
for shaping values and morality.\
11:32\
In the New Testament, we read of many\
turning away from Jesus\
11:36\
Christ, murmuring of His doctrine, "This\
is a hard\
11:39\
saying; who can hear it?" That cry is\
still being heard today from those who\
11:46\
seek to expel religion from discourse\
and influence.\
11:51\
If religion is not not there to help\
with shaping character and mediating\
11:56\
hard times, who will be?\
11:59\
Who will teach honesty, gratitude,\
forgiveness and patience?\
12:04\
Who will exhibit charity, compassion,\
and kindness for\
12:07\
the forgotten and the downtrodden?\
12:10\
Who will embrace those who are different\
yet deserving, as are all of\
12:14\
God's children?\
12:16\
Who will open their arms to those in\
need and seek no recompense?\
12:20\
Who will reverence peace and obedience\
to laws greater than the trends of\
12:25\
the day?\
12:27\
Who will respond to the Savior's plea,\
"Go.\
12:30\
and do thou likewise"?\
12:32\
We will!\
12:33\
Yes, brothers and sisters, we will.\
12:36\
I invite you to champion the cause of\
religious freedom.\
12:40\
It is an expression of the God- given\
principle of agency.\
12:45\
Religious freedom brings balance to\
competing philosophies.\
12:49\
The good of religion, its reach, and the\
daily acts of love which\
12:54\
religion inspires only multiply when we\
protect the freedom to express and act\
13:00\
on core beliefs.\
13:02\
I witness that Russell M.\
13:03\
Nelson is God's living prophet.\
13:06\
I testify that Jesus Christ leads and\
guides this church.\
13:10\
He atoned for our sins, was crucified on\
a cross, and was resurrected on\
13:16\
the third day.\
13:17\
Because of Him, we can live again for\
all eternity.\
13:21\
And those who so desire can be with our\
Father in heaven.\
13:25\
This truth I proclaim to all the world.\
13:29\
I am grateful for the freedom to do so.\
13:33\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
