"For God so loved the world, that He\
gave His only begotten Son, that\
0:06\
whosoever believeth in Him should not\
perish, but have everlasting life." The\
0:11\
first time I noticed this verse, I was\
not at church or in family\
0:15\
home evening.\
0:16\
I was watching a sporting event on\
television.\
0:20\
No matter what station I watched and no\
matter what game it\
0:23\
was, at least one person held a sign\
that read, "John 3:16." I have come to\
0:29\
equally love verse 17: "For God sent not\
his Son into the world to condemn\
0:34\
the world; but that the world through\
him might be saved." God sent Jesus\
0:40\
Christ, His only Son in the flesh, to\
lay down His life for every\
0:45\
one of us.\
0:46\
This He did because He loves us and\
designed a plan for each of us to\
0:51\
return home to Him.\
0:53\
But this is not a blanket, catchall,\
hit-and-miss sort of plan.\
0:56\
It is personal, set forth by a loving\
Heavenly Father who knows our\
1:01\
hearts, our names, and what He needs us\
to do.\
1:05\
Why do we believe that?\
1:07\
Because we are taught it in the holy\
scriptures.\
1:10\
Moses repeatedly heard Heavenly Father\
speak the words, "Moses, my son."\
1:15\
Abraham learned he was a child of God\
chosen for his mission even before He\
1:20\
was born.\
1:21\
By the hand of God, Esther\
1:23\
was placed in a position of influence\
1:25\
to save her people.\
1:27\
And God trusted a young woman, a\
servant, to testify of a living\
1:31\
prophet so Naaman could be healed.\
1:34\
I especially love that good man short in\
stature,\
1:38\
who climbed a tree to see\
Jesus.\
1:41\
The Savior knew he was there, stopped,\
looked up into the\
1:44\
branches, and spoke these words:\
"Zacchaeus, come down." And we\
1:49\
cannot forget the 14-year-old who went\
into a grove of trees and learned how\
1:53\
personal the plan really is: "[Joseph,]\
this is My Beloved Son.\
1:59\
Hear Him!" Brothers and sisters, we are\
the focus of Heavenly\
2:04\
Father's plan and the reason for our\
Savior's mission.\
2:08\
Each of us, individually, is Their work\
and Their glory.\
2:13\
To me, no book of scripture illustrates\
this more clearly than has my study of\
2:17\
the Old Testament.\
2:19\
Chapter after chapter, we discover\
examples of how Heavenly Father\
2:23\
and Jehovah are intimately involved in\
our lives.\
2:27\
We have recently been studying about\
Joseph, the beloved son of Jacob.\
2:31\
From his youth, Joseph was highly\
favored of the Lord, yet he experienced\
2:36\
great trials at the hands of his\
brothers.\
2:39\
Two weeks ago, many of us were touched\
by how Joseph forgave his brothers.\
2:43\
In Come, Follow Me, we read: "In many\
ways, Joseph's life parallels that of\
2:47\
Jesus Christ.\
2:49\
Even though our sins caused Him great\
suffering, the Savior offers\
2:53\
forgiveness, delivering all of us from a\
fate far worse than famine.\
2:58\
Whether we need to receive forgiveness\
or extend it-at some point, we all need\
3:03\
to do both-Joseph's example points us to\
the Savior, the true source of\
3:08\
healing and reconciliation." A lesson I\
love in that account comes from\
3:12\
Joseph's brother, Judah, who played a\
part in God's personal plan\
3:17\
for Joseph.\
3:18\
When Joseph was betrayed by his\
brothers, Judah convinced them not to\
3:22\
take Joseph's life, but to sell him into\
slavery.\
3:26\
Many years later, Judah and his brothers\
needed to take their youngest\
3:30\
brother, Benjamin, to Egypt.\
3:32\
Initially, their father resisted, but\
Judah made a promise to\
3:36\
Jacob- he would bring Benjamin home.\
3:39\
In Egypt, Judah's promise was put to the\
test.\
3:42\
Young Benjamin was wrongly accused of a\
crime.\
3:46\
Judah, true to his promise, offered to\
be jailed in Benjamin's place.\
3:50\
"For," he said, "How shall I go up to my\
father and the lad be not with me?"\
3:57\
Judah was determined to keep his promise\
and return Benjamin safely.\
4:03\
Do you ever feel about others the way\
Judah felt towards Benjamin?\
4:08\
Isn't this how parents feel about their\
children?\
4:11\
How missionaries feel about people they\
serve?\
4:14\
How Primary and youth leaders feel about\
those they teach and love?\
4:18\
No matter who you are or your current\
circumstances, someone feels exactly\
4:24\
this way about you.\
4:25\
Someone wants to return to Heavenly\
Father with you.\
4:30\
I am grateful for those who never give\
up on us, who continue to pour out\
4:35\
their souls in prayer for us, and who\
continue to teach and help us qualify\
4:40\
to return home to our Father in Heaven.\
4:44\
Recently, a dear friend spent 233 days\
in the hospital with COVID-19.\
4:50\
During that time, he was visited by his\
deceased father, who asked that\
4:54\
a message be delivered to his\
grandchildren.\
4:58\
Even from beyond the veil, this good\
grandfather desired to help his\
5:02\
grandchildren return to their heavenly\
home.\
5:06\
Increasingly disciples of Christ are\
remembering the\
5:09\
"Benjamins" in their\
lives.\
5:11\
Across the world, they have heard the\
clarion call of God's living\
5:14\
prophet, President Russell M Nelson.\
5:18\
Young men and young women are engaged in\
the Lord's youth battalion.\
5:22\
Individuals and families are reaching\
out in a spirit of\
5:25\
ministering, loving, sharing, and\
inviting friends and neighbors to\
5:29\
come unto Christ.\
5:30\
Youth and adults are remembering and\
striving to keep their covenants-\
5:35\
filling God's temples, finding names of\
deceased family members, and receiving\
5:40\
ordinances on their behalf.\
5:43\
Why does Heavenly Father's personalized\
plan for us include helping others\
5:47\
return to Him?\
5:48\
Because this is how we become like Jesus\
Christ.\
5:52\
Ultimately, the account of Judah and\
Benjamin teaches us about\
5:57\
the Savior's sacrifice for us.\
6:00\
Through His Atonement, He gave His life\
to bring us home.\
6:05\
Judah's words expressed the Savior's\
love: "How shall I go up to my\
6:09\
father, and [you] be not with me?" As\
gatherers of Israel, those can be our\
6:16\
words as well.\
6:18\
The Old Testament is packed with\
miracles and tender mercies that are\
6:21\
the hallmark of Heavenly Father's plan.\
6:24\
In 2 Kings, chapter 4, the phrase "it\
fell on a day" is used three times to\
6:29\
emphasize to me that important events\
happen according to God's\
6:33\
timing, and no detail is too small for\
Him.\
6:38\
My new friend Paul testifies of this\
truth.\
6:42\
Paul grew up in a home that was\
sometimes abusive and always intolerant\
6:46\
of religion.\
6:48\
While attending school on a military\
base in Germany, he noticed two sisters\
6:53\
who seem to have a spiritual light.\
6:56\
Asking why they were different brought\
the answer that they belong to The\
7:00\
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints.\
7:03\
Soon, Paul began meeting with\
missionaries and was invited to church.\
7:08\
That next Sunday, as he got off the bus,\
he noticed two men dressed in\
7:11\
white shirts and ties.\
7:12\
He asked them if they were elders of the\
Church.\
7:15\
They answered yes, so Paul followed\
them.\
7:18\
During the service, a preacher pointed\
to people in the congregation\
7:22\
and invited them to testify.\
7:25\
At the end of each testimony, a drummer\
gave a drum salute and\
7:28\
the congregation called out "Amen." When\
the preacher pointed to\
7:33\
Paul, he stood up and said, "I know\
Joseph Smith was a prophet and\
7:38\
the Book of Mormon is true." There was\
no drum salute or amens.\
7:45\
Paul eventually realized he had gone to\
the wrong church.\
7:49\
Soon, Paul found his way to the right\
place and was baptized.\
7:54\
On the day of Paul's baptism, a member\
he didn't know told him, "You saved my\
7:59\
life." A few weeks earlier, this man had\
decided to look for another church\
8:05\
and attended a service with drums and\
amens.\
8:08\
When the man heard Paul bear his\
testimony of Joseph Smith and the Book\
8:13\
of Mormon, he realized that God knew\
him, recognized his struggles, and had\
8:18\
a plan for him.\
8:20\
For both Paul and the man, "it fell on a\
day" indeed!\
8:25\
We, too, know that Heavenly Father has a\
personal plan of happiness for each\
8:28\
of us.\
8:29\
Because God sent His beloved Son for us,\
the miracles we need will fall\
8:35\
on the very day necessary for His plan\
to be fulfilled.\
8:39\
I testify that this year we can learn\
more about God's plan for us in\
8:43\
the Old Testament.\
8:44\
That sacred volume teaches the role of\
prophets in uncertain times and God's\
8:49\
hand in a world that was confused and\
often contentious.\
8:53\
It is also about humble believers who\
faithfully looked forward to\
8:57\
the coming of our Savior, just as we\
look forward to and prepare for His\
9:02\
Second Coming- His long-prophesied,\
glorious return.\
9:06\
Until that day, we may not see with our\
natural eyes the design of God for all\
9:11\
aspects of our lives, but we can\
remember Nephi's response when faced\
9:16\
with something he didn't understand.\
9:18\
While he didnâ€™t know the meaning of all\
things,\
9:21\
he knew that God loves His\
children.\
9:24\
This is my witness on this beautiful\
Sabbath morning.\
9:28\
May we write it on our hearts and allow\
it to fill our souls with\
9:31\
peace, hope, and eternal joy.\
9:33\
God so loved us that He sent His only\
begotten Son, not to condemn\
9:39\
us, but to save us.\
9:41\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
