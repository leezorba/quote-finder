As Job in the Old Testament, in a time\
of suffering some might feel that God\
0:07\
has abandoned them.\
0:10\
Because we know that God has power to\
prevent or remove any\
0:13\
affliction, we may be tempted to\
complain if He does not do it, perhaps\
0:19\
questioning, "If God does not grant the\
help I pray for, how can I have\
0:24\
faith in Him?" At one point in his\
intense trials, righteous Job\
0:30\
said, "Then know that God has wronged me\
and drawn his net around me.\
0:37\
Though I cry, ['I've been wronged]!' I\
get no response; though I call\
0:40\
for help, there is no justice." In His\
response to Job, God demands, "Will\
0:48\
thou condemn me that thou mayest be\
righteous?" Or in other words, "Will\
0:53\
you even put me in the wrong?\
0:56\
Will you condemn me that you may be\
justified?" Jehovah forcefully reminds\
1:02\
Job of His omnipotence and omniscience,\
and Job in deepest\
1:07\
humility admits he possesses nothing\
even close to the knowledge,\
1:12\
power, and righteousness of God and he\
cannot stand in judgment of\
1:17\
the Almighty.\
1:19\
"I know that thou canst do every thing,"\
he said, "and that no thought\
1:23\
can be withholden from thee.\
1:26\
...I uttered that I understood not;\
things too wonderful for\
1:30\
me, which I knew not.\
1:31\
...\
1:32\
Wherefore I abhor myself and repent in\
dust and ashes." In the end, Job was\
1:38\
privileged to see the Lord, and "the\
Lord blessed the latter end of Job more\
1:43\
than His beginning." It truly is folly\
for us, with our mortal\
1:48\
myopia, to presume, to judge God- to\
think, for example, "I'm not\
1:55\
happy, so God must be doing something\
wrong." To us, His mortal children in\
2:01\
a fallen world, who know so little of\
past, present and future, He\
2:06\
declares, "All things are present with\
me, for I know them all." Jacob wisely\
2:12\
cautions, "Seek not to counsel the Lord,\
but to take counsel from his hand.\
2:17\
...\
2:18\
Behold, ye yourselves know that he\
counseleth in wisdom, and in\
2:21\
justice, and in great mercy, over all\
his works."\
2:27\
Some misunderstand the promises of God\
to mean that obedience to Him yields\
2:32\
specific outcomes on a fixed schedule.\
2:36\
They might think, "If I diligently serve\
a full-time mission, God will\
2:40\
bless me with a happy marriage and\
children," or "If I refrain from\
2:45\
doing schoolwork on the Sabbath, God\
will bless me with good\
2:49\
grades," or "If I pay tithing, God will\
bless me with that job I've been\
2:54\
wanting." If life doesn't fall out\
precisely this way or according to\
3:01\
an expected timetable, they may feel\
betrayed by God.\
3:07\
But things are not so mechanical in the\
divine economy.\
3:11\
We ought not to think of God's plan as a\
cosmic vending machine where we\
3:16\
select the desired blessing, insert the\
required sum of good\
3:19\
works, and the order is promptly\
delivered.\
3:24\
God will indeed honor His covenants and\
promises to each of us.\
3:27\
We need not worry about that.\
3:30\
The atoning power of Jesus Christ- who\
descended below all things and then\
3:34\
ascended on high and who possesses all\
power in heaven and earth-ensures that\
3:41\
God can and will fulfill His promises.\
3:45\
It is essential that we honor and obey\
His laws, but not every blessing\
3:49\
predicated on obedience to law is\
shaped, designed, and timed according\
3:55\
to our expectations.\
3:58\
We do our best, but leave to Him the\
management of blessings, both\
4:03\
temporal and spiritual.\
4:06\
President Brigham Young explained that\
his faith was not built on certain\
4:10\
outcomes or blessings,\
4:11\
but on his witness of and relationship\
4:13\
with Jesus Christ.\
4:16\
He said, "My faith is not placed upon\
the Lord's working upon the islands of\
4:21\
the sea, upon His bringing the people\
here;...\
4:24\
nor upon the favors He bestows upon this\
people or upon that\
4:28\
people, neither upon whether we are\
blessed or not blessed, but my faith is\
4:34\
placed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, and\
my knowledge I have\
4:38\
received from Him." Our repentance and\
obedience, our service\
4:44\
and sacrifices, do matter.\
4:46\
We want to be among those described by\
Ether as "always abounding in good\
4:51\
works." But it is not so much because of\
some tally kept in\
4:56\
a celestial account books.\
4:58\
These things matter because they engage\
us in God's work and are the means by\
5:03\
which we collaborate with Him in our own\
transformation\
5:07\
from natural man to\
saint.\
5:10\
What our Heavenly Father offers us is\
Himself and His Son, a close\
5:15\
and enduring relationship with Them\
through the grace and mediation of\
5:19\
Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.\
5:23\
We are God's children and set apart for\
immortality and eternal life.\
5:29\
Our destiny is to be His heirs,\
"joint-heirs with Christ." Our\
5:34\
Father is willing to guide each of us\
along His covenant path with steps\
5:39\
designed to our individual need and\
tailored to His plan for our\
5:44\
ultimate happiness with Him.\
5:47\
We can anticipate a growing trust and\
faith in the Father and the\
5:50\
Son, an increasing sense of Their love,\
and the consistent comfort\
5:56\
and guidance of the Holy Spirit.\
5:59\
Even so, this path cannot be easy for\
any of us.\
6:03\
There's too much refining needed for it\
to be easy.\
6:07\
Jesus said, "I am the true vine, and my\
Father is the husbandman.\
6:12\
Every branch in me that beareth not\
fruit, [the Father] taketh\
6:15\
away; and every branch that beareth\
fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring\
6:20\
forth more fruit." The process of\
God-directed purging and purifying\
6:27\
will, of necessity, be wrenching and\
painful at times.\
6:31\
Recalling Paul's expression, we are\
"joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that\
6:37\
we suffer with him, that we may be also\
glorified together."\
6:44\
In the midst of this refiner's fire,\
rather than get angry with\
6:48\
God, get close to God.\
6:51\
Call upon the Father in the name of the\
Son.\
6:54\
Walk with Them in the Spirit, day by\
day.\
6:58\
Allow Them over time to manifest Their\
fidelity to you.\
7:04\
Come truly to know Them and truly to\
know yourself.\
7:06\
Let God prevail.\
7:10\
The Savior reassures us: "Listen to him\
who is the advocate with the\
7:14\
Father, who is pleading your cause\
before him- Saying: Father, behold\
7:19\
the sufferings and death of him who did\
no sin, in whom thou wast well\
7:24\
pleased; behold the blood of thy Son,\
which was shed, the blood of him\
7:28\
whom thou gavest that thyself might be\
glorified; Wherefore, Father, spare\
7:35\
these my brethren [and my sisters] that\
believe on my name, that they may come\
7:41\
unto me and have everlasting life."\
7:46\
Consider some examples of faithful men\
and women who trusted God, confident\
7:50\
that His promised blessings would be\
upon them in life or in death.\
7:55\
Their faith was based not on what God\
did or did not do in a particular\
7:59\
circumstance or moment in time, but on\
knowing Him as their\
8:04\
benevolent Father and Jesus Christ as\
their faithful Redeemer.\
8:10\
When Abraham was about to be sacrificed\
by the Egyptian priest of\
8:13\
Elkanah, he cried out to God to save\
him, and God did.\
8:18\
Abraham lived to become the father of\
the faithful through whose seed all\
8:23\
the families of the earth would be\
blessed.\
8:27\
Earlier on this very same altar, that\
same priest of Elkanah had\
8:31\
offered up three virgins who "because of\
their virtue;...would not bow down\
8:36\
to worship gods of wood or stone." They\
died there as martyrs.\
8:41\
Joseph of old, sold into slavery as a\
youth by his own brothers, in his\
8:46\
anguish turned to God.\
8:49\
Gradually, he rose to prominence in his\
master's house in Egypt, but then had\
8:53\
all this progress ripped away because of\
the false accusations of\
8:58\
Potipher's wife.\
9:00\
Joseph could have thought, "So, prison\
is what I get for keeping\
9:03\
the law of chastity," but instead, he\
continued to turn to God\
9:08\
and was prospered even in prison.\
9:11\
Joseph suffered a further crushing\
disappointment when the prisoner he\
9:15\
befriended, despite his promise to help\
Joseph, forgot all about him after\
9:20\
being restored to his position in\
Pharaoh's court.\
9:24\
In due course, as you know, the Lord\
intervened to put Joseph in\
9:28\
the highest position of trust and power\
next to Pharaoh, enabling\
9:32\
Joseph to save the house of Israel.\
9:36\
Surely Joseph could attest that "all\
things work together for good to them\
9:40\
that love God." Abinadi was intent on\
fulfilling his divine commission.\
9:47\
"I finished my message," he said, "and\
then it matters not [what\
9:51\
happens to me], if it so be that I am\
saved." He was not spared a martyr's\
9:56\
death, but assuredly he was saved in the\
kingdom of God, and his one\
10:01\
precious convert, Alma, changed the\
course of Nephite history leading\
10:07\
up to the coming of Christ.\
10:10\
Alma and Amulek were delivered from\
prison in Ammonihah in answer to their\
10:14\
plea, and their persecutors were slain.\
10:17\
Earlier, however, these same persecutors\
had cast believing women\
10:22\
and their children into a raging fire.\
10:26\
Alma, witnessing the horrific scene in\
agony, was constrained by the Spirit\
10:30\
not to exercise the power of God to\
"save them from the flames" that they\
10:36\
might be received up to God in glory.\
10:40\
The Prophet Joseph Smith languished in\
jail at Liberty, Missouri, powerless to\
10:44\
help the Saints as they were pillaged\
and driven from their homes in\
10:48\
the bitter cold of winter.\
10:50\
"O God, where art thou?" Joseph cried.\
10:53\
"How long shall thy hand be stayed?" In\
response, the Lord promised: "Thine\
10:58\
adversity and thine afflictions shall be\
but a small moment; and\
11:02\
then, if thou endure it well, God shall\
exalt thee on high.\
11:07\
...Thou art not yet as Job." In the end,\
Joseph could declare with\
11:12\
Job, "Though [God] slay me, yet will I\
trust in him." Elder Brook P.\
11:19\
Hales related the story of Sister\
Patricia Parkinson, who was born with\
11:23\
normal eyesight but by age 11 had gone\
blind.\
11:27\
Elder Hales recounted: "I've known Pat\
for many years and recently told her\
11:32\
that I admired the fact that she's\
always positive and happy.\
11:36\
She responded, 'Well, you've not been at\
home with me, have you?\
11:40\
I have my moments.\
11:42\
I've had rather severe bouts of\
depression and I've cried a lot.′\
11:47\
However, she added, 'From the time I\
started losing my sight, it was\
11:51\
strange, but I knew that Heavenly Father\
and the Savior were with my\
11:56\
family and me.\
11:57\
To those who ask me if I am angry\
because I am blind, I respond.\
12:03\
"Who would I be angry with?\
12:06\
Heavenly Father is in this with me.\
12:08\
I am not alone.\
12:09\
He is with me all the time.'"\
12:13\
In the end, it is the blessing of a\
close and abiding relationship with\
12:18\
the Father and the Son that we seek.\
12:21\
It makes all the difference and is\
everlastingly worth the cost.\
12:27\
We will testify with Paul "that the\
sufferings of this present [mortal]\
12:31\
time are not worthy to to be compared\
with the glory which shall be revealed\
12:37\
in us." I bear witness that no matter\
what our mortal experience may\
12:43\
entail, we can trust God and find joy in\
Him.\
12:48\
"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart;\
12:51\
and lean not unto thine own\
understanding.\
12:55\
In all thy ways, acknowledge him, And he\
shall direct thy paths." In\
12:59\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
