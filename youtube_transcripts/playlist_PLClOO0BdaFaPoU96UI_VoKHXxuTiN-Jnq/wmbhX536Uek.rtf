I have a dear friend who is a brilliant,\
retired university professor,\
0:08\
prolific author, and above all, a\
committed disciple of Jesus Christ.\
0:13\
He has visited the Holy Land dozens of\
times to participate in\
0:17\
conferences, conduct academic research,\
and lead tours.\
0:22\
According to him, every time he visits\
the land where Jesus walked, he marvels\
0:28\
because he undoubtedly learned something\
new, astonishing,\
0:31\
and fascinating about the Savior, His\
mortal ministry, and His\
0:36\
beloved homeland.\
0:38\
The awe my friend shows when he talks\
about all that he learns in the Holy\
0:44\
Land is contagious.\
0:46\
And this amazement has been fundamental\
in his great achievements and academic\
0:51\
pursuits in his life.\
0:53\
As I have listened to his experiences\
and felt of his enthusiasm, I have\
0:59\
reflected on how much more spiritual\
wonder, so to speak, that we can\
1:05\
and should feel for the gospel of Jesus\
Christ and the difference it can make\
1:10\
in our discipleship and in our journey\
toward eternal life.\
1:15\
The wonder I refer to is the sensation\
of emotion, awe, or amazement common to\
1:22\
all who wholeheartedly centered their\
lives on the Savior and His\
1:27\
teachings, and humbly recognize His\
presence in their lives.\
1:32\
Such a feeling of wonder, inspired by\
the influence of the Holy\
1:35\
Ghost, stimulates the enthusiasm to\
joyfully live the doctrine of Christ.\
1:41\
The scriptures contain several examples\
of how this sensation is manifest.\
1:47\
The prophet Isaiah, for example,\
expressed the depth of his\
1:51\
gratitude for the Lord through his\
rejoicing in Him.\
1:56\
Those who heard Jesus preaching in the\
synagogue at Capernaum were\
2:00\
astonished at His doctrine and the\
strength with which He taught.\
2:07\
It was the same feeling that penetrated\
every fiber of young Joseph Smith's\
2:12\
heart as he read from the Bible the\
first chapter of James, leading him\
2:17\
to seek the wisdom of God.\
2:20\
My brothers and sisters, when we truly\
are in awe of Jesus Christ and His\
2:27\
gospel, we are happier.\
2:30\
We have more enthusiasm for God's work,\
and we recognize the Lord's hand\
2:35\
in all things.\
2:36\
Additionally, our study of God's words\
is more meaningful, our prayers more\
2:42\
intentional, our worship more reverent,\
our service in God's kingdom\
2:47\
more diligent.\
2:48\
All of these actions contribute to the\
Holy Spirit's influence being more\
2:53\
frequent in our lives.\
2:55\
Thus, our testimony of the Savior and\
His gospel will be strengthened.\
3:00\
We will keep Christ alive in us, and we\
will leave our lives rooted\
3:05\
and built up in Him and established in\
the faith abounding therein\
3:11\
with thanksgiving.\
3:13\
When we live in this way, we become more\
spiritually resilient\
3:17\
and protected against falling into the\
trap of spiritual apathy.\
3:24\
Such apathy is characterized by the\
gradual loss of our excitement to\
3:29\
engage fully in the Lord's gospel.\
3:32\
It generally begins when we are feeling\
that we have already attained all\
3:37\
the necessary knowledge and blessings\
for our happiness in this life.\
3:41\
This complacency, so to speak, causes us\
to take the gospel gifts\
3:46\
for granted.\
3:47\
And from then on, we run the risk of\
neglect, neglecting both our regular\
3:53\
immersion in the essentials of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ and\
3:57\
the covenants we have made.\
3:59\
Consequently, we gradually distance\
ourselves from the Lord, weakening our\
4:05\
ability to hear Him, becoming\
indifferent and insensitive to\
4:11\
the greatness of His work.\
4:14\
Doubt, regarding the truths we have\
already received, may enter our mind\
4:18\
and heart, making us vulnerable to the\
enemy's temptations.\
4:24\
Pastor Aiden Wilson Tozer, a renowned\
writer and valiant Christian, wrote.\
4:30\
"Complacency is a deadly foe of all\
spiritual growth." Wasn't this exactly\
4:38\
what happened to the people of Nephi\
shortly after the birth of Christ?\
4:43\
They "began to be less and less\
astonished at a sign or wonder from\
4:48\
heaven," "[disbelieving] all which they\
had heard and seen." Thus did\
4:55\
Satan, "blind their eyes and lead them\
away to believe that the doctrine of\
5:00\
Christ was a foolish and vain thing." My\
beloved brothers and\
5:05\
sisters, in His perfect and infinite\
love and knowing our human\
5:11\
nature, the Savior has established the\
way for us to avoid falling into\
5:16\
the trap of spiritual apathy.\
5:19\
The Savior's invitation gives us a\
broader perspective, especially\
5:25\
considering the complex world in which\
we live: "Learn of me and listen to my\
5:32\
words; walk in the meekness of my\
Spirit, and you shall have peace in\
5:38\
me." As we accept the Savior's\
invitation, we demonstrate our\
5:43\
humility, our desire to be teachable,\
and our hope to become more\
5:48\
like Him.\
5:49\
This invitation also includes serving\
Him and ministering to God's children\
5:54\
with all our heart, might, mind, and\
strength.\
5:58\
At the core of our effort in this\
journey is, of course, the two great\
6:02\
commandments: to love the Lord our God,\
and love our neighbor\
6:09\
as ourselves.\
6:11\
This type of behavior is part of Jesus's\
divine character and was\
6:15\
evident in everything He did during His\
earthly ministry.\
6:20\
Therefore, when we intentionally and\
truly dedicate ourselves to look\
6:25\
unto Him and learn from His perfect\
example, we come to know Him better.\
6:31\
We grow in enthusiasm and desire to\
incorporate into our lives\
6:36\
the ultimate standard of how we should\
leave, the example we should\
6:41\
set, and the commandments we should\
follow.\
6:45\
We also gain additional understanding,\
wisdom, divine\
6:48\
character, and grace toward God and our\
neighbors.\
6:53\
I can assure you that our ability to\
feel the Savior's influence and love\
6:59\
will be intensified in our lives,\
magnifying our faith, our desire\
7:05\
to act righteously, and the motivation\
to serve him and others.\
7:11\
In addition, our gratitude for the\
blessings and challenges we\
7:15\
experience in mortality will solidify\
and become part of our true worship.\
7:22\
My dear friends, all these things\
strengthen our spiritual wonder of\
7:27\
the gospel and move us to joyfully keep\
the covenants we make with the\
7:31\
Lord, even in the midst of the trials\
and challenges we experience.\
7:38\
Of course, for these outcomes to happen,\
we need to immerse ourselves\
7:43\
with faith and real intent in the\
Savior's teachings, striving to\
7:48\
incorporate His attributes into our way\
of being.\
7:52\
In addition, we need to draw nearer to\
Him through our repentance, seeking His\
7:58\
forgiveness and His redeeming power in\
our lives, and keeping His commandments.\
8:04\
The Lord Himself promised that He would\
direct our paths if we would trust in\
8:10\
Him with our hearts, acknowledging him\
in all our ways and not leaning on our\
8:17\
own understanding.\
8:20\
A man I met recently whose name is Wes\
and who is attending the conference\
8:25\
today, accepted Christ's invitation to\
learn of Him and of His gospel\
8:31\
and began to experience the awe of His\
love after 27 years of distancing\
8:37\
himself from the covenant path.\
8:41\
He told me that one day, he was\
contacted via Facebook by\
8:50\
a missionary, Elder Jones, who was\
temporarily assigned to Wes's area\
8:55\
before going to his originally assigned\
mission in Panama.\
9:02\
When Elder Jones came across Wes's\
profile, not even knowing beforehand\
9:07\
that he was already a member of the\
Church, he felt the guidance of\
9:11\
the Holy Ghost and knew that he should\
immediately contact Wes.\
9:16\
He quickly acted on this impression.\
9:19\
West was amazed by this unexpected\
contact and began to realize that\
9:26\
the Lord was aware of him, despite the\
distance from the covenant path.\
9:32\
From them on Wes and the missionaries\
began to communicate frequently.\
9:37\
Elder Jones and his companion provided\
weekly acts of service and a spiritual\
9:42\
message that helped Wes to recover his\
awe of the Savior and His gospel.\
9:49\
It rekindled the flame of his testimony\
of the truth and of the Savior's love\
9:55\
for him.\
9:56\
Wes felt the peace that comes from the\
Comforter and gained the strength\
10:02\
he needed to return to the fold.\
10:05\
He told me that this experience brought\
him spiritually and emotionally back to\
10:11\
life and helped him to eliminate the\
feelings of bitterness accumulated\
10:17\
over the years because of the difficult\
experiences he had been through.\
10:23\
As my aforementioned thoughtful\
professor friend has observed, there is\
10:29\
always something wonderful and\
fascinating to learn about Jesus\
10:35\
Christ and His gospel.\
10:38\
The Lord has made wonderful promises\
that are extended to all\
10:42\
those, including us, who seek to learn\
of Him and incorporate His words into\
10:47\
their lives.\
10:49\
To Enoch, he said, "Behold my spirit\
[shall be] upon you, wherefore all thy\
10:56\
words will I justify; and the mountains\
shall flee before\
11:00\
you, and the river shall turn from their\
course; and thou shalt abide in\
11:05\
me, and I in you." Through His servant,\
King Benjamin, He declared.\
11:12\
"Ye shall be called the children of\
Christ, His sons and His\
11:16\
daughters; for behold, this day He hath\
spiritually begotten you; for ye say\
11:23\
that your hearts are changed through\
faith on His name; therefore ye are\
11:28\
born of him and have become His sons and\
His daughters." Therefore, as we\
11:35\
genuinely and continually strive to\
learn of the Savior and follow His\
11:41\
example, I promise you in His name that\
His Divine Attributes will be written\
11:49\
in our minds and hearts, that we will\
become more like Him, and that we will\
11:54\
walk with Him.\
11:56\
My beloved brothers and sisters, I pray\
that we will ever stand\
12:01\
in awe of Jesus Christ and His complete,\
infinite, and perfect love.\
12:09\
May the remembrance of what our eyes\
have seen and our hearts have felt\
12:15\
increase our amazement at the Savior's\
atoning sacrifice, which can heal us of\
12:21\
our spiritual and emotional wounds and\
helps us to draw closer to Him.\
12:27\
May we marvel at the great promises that\
the Father has in His hands\
12:33\
and that He has prepared for those who\
are faithful: "The kingdom is yours\
12:40\
and the blessings thereof are yours, and\
the reaches of eternity are yours.\
12:46\
And he who receiveth all things with\
thankfulness shall be made glorious."\
12:53\
Jesus is the Redeemer of the world, and\
this is His Church.\
12:59\
I bear witness of these truths in the\
awe-inspired, sacred, and sublime\
13:06\
name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.\
