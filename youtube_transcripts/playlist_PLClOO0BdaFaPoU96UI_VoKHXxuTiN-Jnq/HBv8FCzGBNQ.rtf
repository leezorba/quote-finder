Moral agency is God's precious gift to\
His children.\
0:05\
We're free to choose liberty and eternal\
life through the Great\
0:08\
Mediator of all men, or to choose\
captivity and death according to\
0:13\
the captivity and power of the devil.\
0:16\
God won't force us to do good, and the\
devil can't force us to do evil.\
0:21\
Though some may think that mortality is\
a contest between God and\
0:24\
the adversary, a word from the Savior\
and Satan is silenced and banished.\
0:30\
It is our strength that is being tested,\
not God's.\
0:35\
In the end, we will therefore reap what\
our lifelong choices have sown.\
0:40\
So what does the sum total of our\
thoughts, desires, words, and works say\
0:45\
about our love for the Savior,\
0:48\
His chosen servants, and\
His restored church?\
0:52\
Do our baptismal, priesthood, and temple\
covenants mean more to us\
0:56\
than the praise of the world or the\
number of likes on social media?\
1:00\
Is our love for the Lord and His\
commandment stronger than our love\
1:04\
for anything or anyone else in this\
life?\
1:07\
The adversary and his followers have\
always sought to destroy the works of\
1:11\
Christ and His prophets.\
1:13\
The Savior's commandments, if not\
ignored altogether, have been\
1:17\
rationalized into meaninglessness by\
many in today's world.\
1:21\
Messengers of God who teach\
“inconvenient” truths\
1:24\
are often dismissed.\
1:26\
Even the Savior Himself was called "a\
man gluttonous, and a\
1:30\
winebibber," accused of disturbing\
public sentiment and being divisive.\
1:35\
Weak and conniving souls "took counsel\
how they might entangle Him in His\
1:40\
talk,” and His “sect” of early\
Christians was “every where...\
1:44\
spoken against." The Savior and His\
early followers dealt with serious\
1:48\
internal and external opposition, and we\
experience\
1:52\
the same.\
1:53\
Today, it is almost impossible to\
courageously live our faith without\
1:58\
occasionally attracting a few actual and\
virtual fingers of scorn from\
2:03\
the worldly.\
2:04\
Confidently following the Savior is\
rewarding.\
2:08\
But at times, we may get caught in the\
crosshairs of those advocating\
2:12\
an "eat, drink, and be merry"\
philosophy, where faith in\
2:15\
Christ, obedience, and repentance are\
substituted by the illusion that God\
2:21\
will justify a little sin because He\
loves us so much.\
2:25\
Speaking "by [His] own voice or by the\
voice of [His] servants," did\
2:29\
the Savior not say about our day that\
"the time will come when they will not\
2:33\
endure sound doctrine; but after their\
own lusts shall they heap to themselves\
2:37\
teachers," and that many "shall turn\
away their ears from the truth\
2:41\
and shall be turned unto fables"?\
2:44\
Did He not lament that "In vain do they\
worship me, teaching the doctrines-for\
2:48\
doctrines, the commandments of men"?\
2:51\
Did he not warn that "of your own selves\
shall men arise, speaking\
2:55\
perverse things, to draw away disciples\
after them"?\
2:59\
Did He not foresee that "evil [would be\
called] good, and good evil," and that\
3:03\
"a man's foes shall be they of his own\
household"?\
3:07\
So what about us?\
3:08\
Should we be intimidated or afraid?\
3:11\
Should we live our religion at periscope\
depth?\
3:13\
Surely not.\
3:15\
With faith in Christ, we need not fear\
the reproach of men or be afraid of\
3:20\
their revilings?\
3:22\
With the Savior at the helm and living\
prophets to lead and guide us, "who can\
3:26\
be against us"?\
3:28\
Let us be confident, not apologetic;\
valiant, not\
3:32\
timid; faithful, not fearful as we hold\
up the Lord's light in these last days.\
3:39\
The Savior made clear that "whosoever\
therefore shall confess me before\
3:43\
men, him will I confess also before my\
Father, but whosoever shall deny me\
3:49\
before men him will I also deny before\
my Father." Consequently, while some\
3:55\
would prefer a God who comes without\
commandments, let us boldly testify in\
4:00\
the words of Elder D. Todd\
Christofferson\
4:03\
that “a God who makes no\
demands is the functional\
4:06\
equivalent of a God who does not exist."\
While some would prefer to be\
4:11\
selective in the commandments they\
follow, let us joyfully accept\
4:15\
the Savior's invitation to "live by\
every word which proceeded forth out of\
4:19\
the mouth of God." While many believe\
the Lord and His Church should condone\
4:24\
doing "whatsoever [our] heart desireth,"\
let us valiantly proclaim\
4:29\
that it is wrong to "follow a multitude\
to do evil,"\
4:32\
because "crowds cannot make right what\
God has declared to be wrong." "O\
4:38\
remember, remember, how strict [yet\
liberating] are the commandments of\
4:42\
God." Teaching them clearly may at times\
be seen as an act of intolerance.\
4:48\
Let us therefore respectfully\
demonstrate that it is not only\
4:51\
possible, but essential to love a child\
of God who embraces beliefs\
4:56\
different from our own.\
4:58\
We can accept and respect others without\
endorsing their beliefs\
5:03\
or actions that do not align with the\
Lord's will.\
5:07\
There is no need to sacrifice truth on\
the altar of agreeableness\
5:12\
or social desirability.\
5:14\
Zion and Babylon are incompatible.\
5:17\
"No man can serve two masters." Let's\
all remember the Savior's penetrating\
5:22\
question, "Why call you me, Lord, Lord,\
and do not the things which\
5:27\
I say?" Let us demonstrate our love for\
the Lord through\
5:31\
wholehearted, voluntary obedience.\
5:35\
If you feel caught between your\
discipleship and the world, please\
5:38\
remember that your loving Savior\
"sendeth an invitation for the arms of\
5:43\
mercy are extended to [you], and he\
saith, Repent and I will receive you."\
5:49\
President Nelson taught that Jesus\
Christ "will perform some of his\
5:53\
mightiest works between now and when He\
comes again." But he also taught that\
5:58\
"those who choose the Lord's sway will\
likely endure persecution." Being\
6:04\
"counted worthy to suffer shame for his\
name" may at times be our lot\
6:09\
as we allow His voice to take priority\
over any other.\
6:15\
"Blessed is he," the Savior said,\
"whosoever shall not be offended\
6:18\
in me." Elsewhere we learn that "great\
peace have they which love thy\
6:22\
law; and nothing shall offend them."\
Nothing.\
6:26\
So let's ask ourselves, Am I enduring\
for a while, but when tribulation\
6:31\
or persecution arise because of the\
word, by and by am I offended?\
6:36\
Am I firmly built on the rock of Jesus\
Christ and His servants?\
6:42\
Moral relativists advocate that truth is\
merely a social construct, that\
6:46\
there are no moral absolutes.\
6:49\
What they're really saying is that there\
is no sin, that "whatsoever\
6:53\
a man [does is] no crime," a philosophy\
for which the adversary is\
6:57\
claiming proud authorship.\
7:00\
Let us therefore beware of wolves in\
sheep's clothing, who are always\
7:04\
recruiting and "often use their\
intellectual reservations to cover\
7:09\
their [own] behavior lapses." If we\
really want to be valiant disciples of\
7:14\
Christ, we will find a way.\
7:17\
Otherwise, the adversary offers enticing\
alternatives.\
7:21\
But as faithful disciples, "we need not\
apologize for our beliefs nor back down\
7:28\
from that which we know to be true." In\
conclusion, a word about the 15\
7:33\
servants of God seated behind me.\
7:36\
While the worldly "say to the seers, See\
not; and to the\
7:39\
prophets, Prophesy not," the faithful\
are "crowned with blessings from\
7:44\
above, yea, and with commandments not a\
few, and with revelations in their\
7:48\
time." Not surprisingly, these men\
frequently become the lightning rods\
7:54\
for those unhappy with the Word of God\
as the prophets proclaim it.\
7:59\
They don't realize that "no prophecy of\
the scripture is [to be] of any private\
8:04\
interpretation" or the result of the\
will of man "but [that] holy men of\
8:09\
God [speak now] as they [are] moved by\
the Holy Ghost." Like Paul, these men\
8:15\
of God are "not ashamed of the testimony\
of our Lord" and are His\
8:19\
"prisoner[s]," in the sense that the\
doctrine they teach is not\
8:23\
theirs, but His that called them.\
8:25\
Like Peter, they "cannot but speak to\
things which [they] have seen\
8:28\
and heard." I testify that the First\
Presidency and the Quorum of\
8:33\
the Twelve are good and honest men who\
love God and His children and who are\
8:37\
loved by Him.\
8:39\
Their words we should receive, as if\
from the Lord's own mouth, "in all\
8:43\
patience and faith.\
8:45\
For by doing these things, the gates of\
hell shall not prevail against\
8:49\
[us], and the Lord God will disperse the\
powers of darkness from before\
8:54\
[us]." "No unhallowed hand, can stop the\
work from progressing"; It will\
8:59\
march on triumphantly, with or without\
you or me.\
9:03\
So "choose you this day whom you will\
serve." Don't be fooled or intimidated\
9:08\
by the loud adversarial noises emanating\
from the great and spacious building.\
9:14\
Their desperate decibels are no match\
for the serene influence of the\
9:18\
still, small voice upon broken hearts\
and contrite spirits.\
9:24\
I testify that Christ lives, that He is\
our Savior and Redeemer, and that He\
9:29\
leads His Church through the First\
Presidency and the Quorum of\
9:33\
the Twelve Apostles, thus assuring that\
we are not "tossed to and fro\
9:37\
and carried about with every wind of\
doctrine." "True disciples of Jesus\
9:42\
Christ," President Nelson taught, "are\
willing to stand\
9:46\
out, speak up, and be different from the\
people of the world.\
9:51\
They are undaunted, devoted, and\
courageous." Brothers and\
9:56\
sisters, it's a good day to be good.\
10:00\
In the sacred name of Jesus Christ,\
amen.\
