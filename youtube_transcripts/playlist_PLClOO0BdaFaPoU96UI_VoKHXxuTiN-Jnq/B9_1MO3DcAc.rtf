The gospel plan shows our Heavenly\
Father's love for all His children.\
0:07\
To understand this, we must seek to\
understand His plan\
0:09\
and His commandments.\
0:13\
He loves His children so much that He\
gave His Only Begotten Son, Jesus\
0:18\
Christ, to be our Savior and Redeemer,\
to suffer and die for us.\
0:26\
In the restored Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints, We have a unique\
0:32\
understanding of our Heavenly Father's\
plan.\
0:36\
This gives us a different way of viewing\
the purpose of mortal\
0:39\
life, the divine judgment that follows\
it, and the ultimate glorious destiny\
0:46\
of all of God's children.\
0:50\
I love you, my brothers and sisters.\
0:53\
I love all of God's children.\
0:56\
When Jesus was asked, "Which is the\
great commandment in the law?" He\
1:01\
taught that loving God and neighbors are\
the first of God's great commandments.\
1:08\
These commands are first because they\
invite us to grow spiritually by\
1:14\
seeking to imitate God's love for us.\
1:19\
I wish we all had a better understanding\
of the loving doctrine\
1:23\
and policies that our Heavenly Father\
and His Son, Jesus Christ, have\
1:28\
established in The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
1:33\
What I say here seeks to clarify how\
God's love explains that doctrine\
1:41\
and the Church's inspired policies.\
1:45\
A common misunderstanding of the\
judgment that ultimately follows\
1:50\
mortal life is that good people go to a\
place called heaven, and bad people\
1:57\
go to an everlasting place called hell.\
2:02\
This erroneous assumption of only two\
ultimate destinations implies that\
2:08\
those who cannot keep all the\
commandments required for heaven\
2:14\
will necessarily be forever destined for\
hell.\
2:19\
A loving Heavenly Father has a better\
plan for His children.\
2:24\
The veiled doctrine of the restored\
Church of Jesus Christ teaches that all\
2:30\
the children of God, with exceptions too\
limited to consider here, will\
2:36\
finally wind up in a kingdom of glory.\
2:40\
"In my father's house are many\
mansions," Jesus taught.\
2:45\
From modern revelation, we know that\
those mansions are in three different\
2:50\
kingdoms of glory.\
2:53\
In the final judgment, each of us will\
be judged according to our deeds\
2:57\
and the desires of our hearts.\
3:00\
Before that, we will need to suffer for\
our unrepented sins.\
3:06\
The scriptures are clear on that.\
3:09\
Then our righteous judge will\
grant us residence\
3:12\
in one of those kingdoms of glory.\
3:16\
Thus, as we know from modern revelation,\
quote, "All shall be judged\
3:22\
and every man shall receive according to\
his own works, his own dominion in\
3:28\
the mansions, which are prepared," end\
of quote.\
3:33\
The Lord has chosen to reveal\
comparatively little about two of these\
3:38\
kingdoms of glory.\
3:41\
In contrast, the Lord has revealed much\
about the highest kingdom of\
3:46\
glory, which the Bible describes as the\
glory of the sun.\
3:52\
In the celestial glory there are three\
degrees or levels.\
3:58\
The highest of these is exaltation in\
the celestial kingdom, wherein we may\
4:04\
become like our Father and His Son,\
Jesus Christ.\
4:08\
To help us develop the godly attributes\
and the change in nature necessary to\
4:15\
realize our divine potential, the Lord\
has revealed doctrine and established\
4:20\
commandments based on eternal law.\
4:25\
This is what we teach in The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
4:28\
Saints, because the purpose of the\
doctrine and policies of this\
4:34\
restored church is to prepare God's\
children for salvation in\
4:39\
the celestial glory, and more\
particularly, for exaltation in its\
4:45\
highest degree.\
4:48\
The covenants made and the blessings\
promised to the faithful in\
4:51\
the temples of God are the key.\
4:56\
This explains our worldwide building of\
temples, about which the choir has sung\
5:02\
so beautifully.\
5:04\
Some are puzzled at this emphasis.\
5:08\
Not that understanding that the\
covenants and ordinances of\
5:12\
the temple guide us toward achieving\
exaltation.\
5:17\
This can only be understood in the\
context of the revealed truth of\
5:22\
three degrees of glory.\
5:25\
Because of our Heavenly Father's great\
love for all His children, He has\
5:30\
provided other kingdoms of glory.\
5:33\
As Elder Quentin L. Cook\
explained yesterday,\
5:37\
all of these are more wonderful \
than we can comprehend.\
5:43\
The Atonement of Jesus Christ makes all\
of this possible.\
5:48\
He has revealed that He, quote,\
"glorifies the Father and saves\
5:54\
all the works of His hands," end of\
quote.\
5:59\
That salvation is granted in different\
kingdoms of glory.\
6:04\
We know from modern revelation that all\
kingdoms have a law given.\
6:09\
Significantly, quote, "he who is not\
able to abide the law of a celestial\
6:15\
kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory.\
6:19\
And he who cannot abide the law of a\
terrestrial kingdom cannot abide\
6:24\
a terrestrial glory.\
6:26\
And he who cannot abide the law of a\
telestial kingdom cannot abide\
6:32\
a telestial glory," end of quote.\
6:35\
In other words, the kingdom of glory we\
receive in the final judgment is\
6:42\
determined by the laws we chose to abide\
in our Heavenly Father's loving plan.\
6:49\
Under that plan, there are multiple\
kingdoms, so that all of his children\
6:54\
can be assigned to a kingdom where they\
can abide.\
7:00\
The teachings and policies of the Lord's\
restored church apply these\
7:05\
eternal truths in a way that can be\
fully understood only in the context of\
7:11\
our Heavenly Father's loving plan for\
all of His children.\
7:16\
Thus, we honor individual agency.\
7:20\
Most are aware of this church's great\
efforts to promote religious freedom.\
7:26\
These efforts are in furtherance of our\
Heavenly Father's plan.\
7:30\
We seek to help all of His children, not\
just our own\
7:34\
members, enjoy the precious freedom to\
choose.\
7:39\
Similarly, we are sometimes asked why we\
send missionaries to so many\
7:44\
nations, even among Christian\
populations.\
7:48\
We are also asked why we give enormous\
humanitarian aid to persons who are not\
7:54\
members of our Church without linking\
this to our missionary efforts.\
8:00\
We do this because the Lord has taught\
us to esteem all of His children\
8:05\
as our brothers and sisters, and we want\
to share our spiritual\
8:09\
and temporal abundance with everyone.\
8:14\
Eternal doctrine also provides a\
distinctive perspective on children.\
8:20\
Through this perspective, we see the\
bearing and nurturing of children\
8:24\
as part of the divine plan.\
8:27\
It is a joyful and sacred duty of those\
given the power to participate in it.\
8:34\
Therefore, we are commanded to teach and\
contend for principles\
8:38\
and practices that provide the best\
conditions for the development\
8:43\
and happiness of children under God's\
plan.\
8:48\
Finally, The Church of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints is properly known\
8:53\
as a family-centered church.\
8:56\
But not well understood is the reality\
that our family-centeredness is not\
9:02\
limited to mortal relationships.\
9:05\
Eternal relationships are also\
fundamental to our theology.\
9:10\
The mission of the restored Church is to\
help all the children of God qualify\
9:16\
for what God desires as their ultimate\
destiny.\
9:22\
By the redemption provided through the\
Atonement of Christ, all may attain\
9:28\
eternal life (exaltation in the\
celestial kingdom), which Mother\
9:34\
Eve declared, "God giveth unto all the\
obedient." This is more than salvation.\
9:43\
President Russell M. Nelson\
has reminded us that,\
9:46\
“In God’s eternal plan, salvation is\
9:49\
an individual matter, but exaltation is\
a family matter."\
9:57\
Fundamental to us is God's revelation\
that exaltation can only be attained\
10:03\
through faithfulness to the covenants of\
an eternal marriage between a man\
10:07\
and a woman.\
10:09\
That divine doctrine is why we teach\
that gender is an essential\
10:14\
characteristic of individual, premortal,\
mortal, and eternal identity\
10:20\
and purpose.\
10:23\
That is also why the Lord has required\
His restored Church to oppose social\
10:30\
and legal pressures to retreat from His\
doctrine of marriage between a man\
10:34\
and a woman, to oppose changes that\
homogenize the differences between men\
10:40\
and women, or to confuse or alter\
gender.\
10:46\
The restored Church's positions on these\
fundamentals frequently\
10:51\
provide-provoke opposition.\
10:56\
We understand that.\
10:58\
Our Heavenly Father's plan allows for\
opposition in all things,\
11:03\
and Satan's most strenuous opposition is\
directed at whatever is most\
11:08\
important to that plan.\
11:11\
Consequently, he seeks to oppose\
progress toward exaltation by\
11:16\
distorting marriage, discouraging\
childbearing, or confusing gender.\
11:23\
However, we know that in the long run,\
the divine purpose and plan of our\
11:28\
loving Heavenly Father will not be\
changed.\
11:32\
Personal circumstances may change.\
11:35\
And God's plan assures that in the long\
run, the faithful who keep\
11:40\
their covenants will have the\
opportunity to qualify for every\
11:45\
promised blessing.\
11:48\
A uniquely valuable teaching to help us\
prepare for eternal life, the greatest\
11:54\
of all the gifts of God, is the 1995\
Proclamation on the Family.\
12:01\
Its declarations are, of course,\
different from some current\
12:04\
laws, practices, and advocacy, such as\
cohabitation and same-sex marriage.\
12:13\
Those who do not fully understand the\
Father's loving plan for His\
12:16\
children may consider this Family\
Proclamation no more than a changeable\
12:21\
statement of policy.\
12:24\
In contrast, we affirm that The Family\
Proclamation, founded on unchangeable\
12:30\
doctrine, defines the kind of family\
relationships where the most important\
12:36\
part of our eternal development can\
occur.\
12:41\
That is the context for the unique\
doctrine and policies of the restored\
12:46\
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints.\
12:50\
In many relationships and circumstances\
in mortal\
12:53\
life, each of us must live with\
differences.\
12:58\
As followers of Christ, who should love\
our fellow man, we should live\
13:03\
peacefully with those who do not believe\
as we do.\
13:07\
We are all children of a loving Heavenly\
Father.\
13:10\
For all of us, He has destined\
life after death\
13:14\
and ultimately a kingdom of glory.\
13:18\
God desires all of us to strive for His\
greatest possible blessings by\
13:23\
keeping His highest commandments,\
covenants,\
13:26\
and ordinances, all of which culminate\
in His holy temples being built\
13:32\
throughout the world.\
13:34\
We must seek to share these truths of\
eternity with others.\
13:39\
But with the love we owe\
to all of our neighbors,\
13:42\
we always accept their decisions.\
13:46\
As a Book of Mormon prophet taught, we\
must press forward having "a\
13:50\
love of God and of all men."\
13:56\
As President Russell M. Nelson declared\
in our last conference, quote,\
14:00\
“There has never been a time\
in the history of the world\
14:02\
when knowledge of our Savior\
14:05\
is more personally vital and relevant to\
every human soul...\
14:11\
The pure doctrine of Christ is powerful.\
14:14\
It changes the life of everyone who\
understands it and seeks to implement\
14:19\
it in his or her life," end of quote.\
14:23\
May we all implement that sacred\
doctrine in our own lives, I pray in\
14:28\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
