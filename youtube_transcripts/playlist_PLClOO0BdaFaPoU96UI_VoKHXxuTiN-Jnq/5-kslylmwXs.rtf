President Thomas S. Monson\
once shared the story of\
0:04\
prison warden Clinton Duffy.\
0:08\
“During the 1940s and 1950s, ...\
0:11\
[Warden] Duffy was well known\
for his efforts to rehabilitate\
0:14\
the men in his prison.\
0:16\
Said one critic, 'You should know that\
leopards don't change their spots!'\
0:21\
Replied Warden Duffy, '[And] you should\
know I don't work with leopards.\
0:25\
I work with men, and men change [their\
spots] every day.'"\
0:31\
One of Satan's greatest lies is that men\
and women cannot change.\
0:34\
This untruth gets told and retold in\
many different ways as the world says\
0:40\
that we simply cannot change or, worse\
yet, that we should not change.\
0:46\
We are taught that our circumstances\
define us.\
0:49\
We should embrace who we really are, the\
world says, and be authentic\
0:53\
to our true selves.\
0:56\
While it is, indeed, good to be\
authentic, we should be authentic to\
0:59\
our real, true selves-as sons and\
daughters of God with a divine\
1:04\
nature and destiny to become like Him.\
1:07\
If our goal is to be authentic to this\
divine nature and destiny, then we will\
1:12\
all need to change.\
1:15\
The scriptural word for change is\
repentance.\
1:19\
"Too many people," President Russell M.\
1:21\
Nelson teaches, "consider repentance as\
punishment-something to be avoided\
1:26\
except in the most serious\
circumstances. ...\
1:30\
When Jesus asks you and me to 'repent,'\
He is inviting us to change."\
1:37\
Computer software developers use\
conditional statements to tell\
1:40\
computers what to do.\
1:42\
These are sometimes referred to as\
"if-then" statements-as in, if x is\
1:48\
true, then do y.\
1:50\
The Lord also operates through\
conditions-conditions of\
1:54\
faith, conditions of righteousness,\
conditions of repentance.\
1:58\
There are many examples of conditional\
statements from God, such as "If you\
2:04\
keep my commandments and endure to the\
end, [then] you shall have eternal\
2:08\
life, which is the greatest of all the\
gifts of God," or "If ye shall ask\
2:15\
with a sincere heart, with real intent,\
having faith in\
2:19\
Christ, [then] he will manifest the\
truth of it unto you, by the power\
2:23\
of the Holy Ghost." Even God's love,\
although infinite and\
2:28\
perfect, is also subject to conditions.\
2:32\
For example, "If ye keep my\
commandments, [then] ye shall abide in\
2:38\
my love; even as I have kept my Father's\
commandments, and abide in his\
2:44\
love." Elder D.\
2:45\
Todd Christofferson further expounded on\
this gospel truth when he taught.\
2:50\
"Some are wont to say, 'The Savior loves\
me just as I am,′ and that is\
2:55\
certainly true.\
2:57\
But He cannot take any of us into His\
kingdom just as we are,\
3:02\
‘for no unclean thing can dwell \
there, or dwell in his presence.’\
3:07\
Our sins must first be resolved.”\
3:11\
The blessing of receiving God’s power\
to help us change is also conditional.\
3:17\
The Savior in the Book of Mormon taught,\
"If men come unto me I will\
3:22\
show unto them their weakness.\
3:24\
I give unto men weakness that they may\
be humble; and my grace is sufficient\
3:30\
for all men that humble themselves\
before me; for if they humble\
3:34\
themselves before me, and have faith in\
me, then will I make weak things become\
3:41\
strong unto them." Now, looking more\
closely at what the Lord is teaching us\
3:46\
here, He first says that He gives men\
and women weakness, singular, which is\
3:53\
part of our mortal experience as fallen,\
or carnal, beings.\
3:57\
We have become natural men and women\
because of the fall of Adam.\
4:02\
But through the Atonement of Jesus\
Christ, we can overcome our\
4:05\
weakness, or our fallen natures.\
4:08\
He then says that His grace is\
sufficient and if we will humble\
4:14\
ourselves and have faith in Him, then He\
will "make weak things\
4:19\
[plural] become strong unto [us]." In\
other words, as we first change our\
4:26\
fallen natures, our weakness, then we\
will be able to change our\
4:30\
behaviors, our weaknesses.\
4:34\
Let's review the requirements to change\
according to the Lord's pattern.\
4:38\
First, we must humble ourselves.\
4:42\
The Lord's condition for change is\
humility.\
4:46\
"If they humble themselves before me,"\
He said.\
4:49\
The opposite of humility is pride.\
4:52\
Pride exists when we think we know\
better- when what we think or feel\
4:58\
takes priority over what God thinks or\
feels.\
5:02\
King Benjamin taught that “the natural\
man is an enemy to God...\
5:06\
and will be, forever and ever,\
unless he...\
5:09\
putteth off the natural man and becometh\
a saint through\
5:13\
the atonement of Christ the Lord, and\
becometh as a child,\
5:16\
submissive, meek, [and] humble." In\
order to change, we need to put off\
5:23\
the natural man and become humble and\
submissive.\
5:26\
We must be humble enough to follow a\
living prophet, humble enough to make\
5:31\
and keep temple covenants, humble enough\
to repent daily.\
5:37\
We must be humble enough to want to\
change, to yield our hearts under God.\
5:44\
Second, we must have faith in Jesus\
Christ.\
5:49\
Again, the words of the Savior: "If they\
humble themselves\
5:52\
before me, and have faith in me," He\
will give us the power to\
5:57\
overcome our weaknesses.\
6:00\
Humility, coupled with faith in Jesus\
Christ, will allow us to access\
6:04\
the enabling power of His grace and the\
fulness of blessings available\
6:10\
because of His Atonement.\
6:13\
President Nelson has taught that "true\
repentance begins with faith that Jesus\
6:18\
Christ has the power to cleanse, heal,\
and strengthen us. ...\
6:23\
It is our faith that unlocks the power\
of God in our lives." Third, through\
6:31\
His grace He can make weak things become\
strong.\
6:37\
If we humble ourselves and have faith in\
Jesus Christ, then His grace will\
6:42\
enable us to change.\
6:45\
In other words, He will empower us to\
change.\
6:49\
This is possible because, as He says,\
"My grace is sufficient for all\
6:54\
men." His strengthening, enabling grace\
gives us power to overcome all\
7:00\
obstacles, all challenges, and all\
weaknesses as we seek to change.\
7:07\
Our greatest weaknesses can become our\
greatest strengths.\
7:12\
We can be changed and become new\
creatures.\
7:16\
Weak things literally can become strong\
under us.\
7:21\
The Savior worked out His infinite and\
eternal Atonement so that we could\
7:25\
in fact repent, change, and become\
better.\
7:30\
We can actually be born again.\
7:33\
We can overcome habits and addictions\
and even the "disposition to do evil."\
7:39\
As sons and daughters of a loving Father\
in Heaven, we have the power\
7:44\
within us to change.\
7:47\
The scriptures are full of examples of\
men and women who changed.\
7:51\
Saul, a Pharisee and active persecutor\
of the early Christian church, became\
7:57\
Paul, an apostle of the Lord Jesus\
Christ.\
8:01\
Alma was a priest in the court of wicked\
King Noah.\
8:04\
He heard the words of Abinidai, fully\
repented, and became\
8:08\
one of the great missionaries of the\
Book of Mormon.\
8:11\
His son, Alma, spent his youth seeking\
to destroy the Church.\
8:15\
He was among the very vilest of sinners\
until he had a change of heart\
8:20\
and became a powerful missionary in his\
own right.\
8:25\
Moses was adopted into Pharaoh’s\
family and raised in luxury as\
8:28\
an Egyptian prince.\
8:30\
But when he came to understand who he\
really was and learned of his divine\
8:35\
destiny, he changed and became the great\
law- giving prophet of\
8:41\
the Old Testament.\
8:43\
My wife's grandfather, James B.\
8:45\
Keysor, has always impressed me with his\
own mighty change of heart.\
8:51\
Born of faithful, Latter-day Saint\
pioneer ancestors in the Salt Lake\
8:56\
Valley in 1906, he lost his mother at a\
young age and struggled throughout\
9:02\
his youth.\
9:03\
His teenage and young adult years were\
spent away from the Church, during\
9:07\
which he acquired a number of bad\
habits.\
9:11\
Nevertheless, he met and married a\
faithful woman, and together they\
9:14\
raised five children.\
9:17\
In 1943, following the difficult years\
of the Great Depression and during\
9:21\
World War II, Bud- as he was called by\
friends and family- left Utah\
9:27\
and moved to Los Angeles, California, to\
look for employment.\
9:31\
During this time away from home, he\
lived with his sister and her\
9:35\
husband, who was serving as the bishop\
of their ward.\
9:39\
With the love and influence of his\
sister and brother-in-law, he started\
9:42\
to revive his interest in the Church and\
began to read the Book of Mormon\
9:46\
each night before going to sleep.\
9:49\
One night, while reading an Alma chapter\
34, his heart was touched\
9:54\
as he read the following words: "Yea, I\
would that ye would come\
9:59\
forth and harden not your hearts any\
longer...\
10:03\
For behold, this life is the time for\
men to prepare to meet\
10:07\
God; yea, behold the day of this life is\
the day for men to perform their\
10:11\
labors." While reading these verses, a\
powerful feeling came over\
10:15\
him and he knew that he had to change,\
to repent, and he knew what he\
10:19\
must do.\
10:21\
He got up from his bed and knelt down\
and began to pray, pleading with\
10:25\
the Lord to forgive him, to give him the\
strength he needed to make changes\
10:29\
in his life.\
10:30\
His prayer was answered, and from that\
time forward, he never looked back.\
10:35\
Bud went on to serve in the Church and\
remained a faithful, committed\
10:39\
Latter-day Saint to the end of his life.\
10:42\
He changed in every way.\
10:44\
His mind, his heart, his actions, his\
very being were changed.\
10:50\
Brothers and sisters, our divine destiny\
and purpose is ultimately to\
10:54\
become like our Heavenly Father and\
Savior Jesus Christ.\
10:58\
We do this as we change, or repent.\
11:01\
We receive the Savior's image in our\
countenance.\
11:04\
We become new, clean, different.\
11:07\
And we simply continue to work at it\
every day.\
11:10\
Sometimes it may feel like two steps\
forward and one step back, but we\
11:15\
continue to humbly move forward in\
faith.\
11:18\
And as we humble ourselves and exercise\
faith in Jesus\
11:21\
Christ, the grace of Christ and His\
infinite atoning sacrifice makes it\
11:27\
possible to change.\
11:29\
I witness and testify that Jesus Christ\
is in reality our Savior and Redeemer.\
11:34\
His grace is indeed sufficient.\
11:37\
I declare that He is the way, the truth,\
and the life.\
11:41\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
