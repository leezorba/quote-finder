Not long ago, a dear friend had an\
impression to visit a woman in her ward.\
0:07\
She brushed off the prompting, because\
she hardly knew her.\
0:10\
It just didn't make sense.\
0:12\
But since the thought kept coming to\
her, she decided to act on\
0:15\
the prompting.\
0:17\
Because she was already feeling\
uncomfortable by the impending\
0:21\
visit, she determined that taking\
something to the sister would help ease\
0:25\
her anxiety.\
0:26\
Certainly, she couldn't go empty-handed.\
0:29\
So she bought a container of ice cream\
and off she went.\
0:33\
To begin what she worried might be an\
awkward visit.\
0:37\
She knocked on the woman's door, and\
shortly the sister answered.\
0:42\
My friend handed her the ice cream in a\
brown paper bag, and\
0:45\
the conversation began.\
0:48\
It didn't take long for my friend to\
realize why the visit was needed.\
0:53\
They sat together on the front porch.\
0:56\
The woman unveiled a host of challenges\
she was facing.\
1:00\
After an hour of talking in the warm\
summer weather, my friend noticed\
1:04\
the ice cream melting through the brown\
paper bag.\
1:07\
She exclaimed, "I am so sorry that your\
ice cream melted." The woman sweetly\
1:13\
responded, "It's okay.\
1:16\
I'm lactose intolerant."\
1:21\
In a dream, the Lord told the Prophet\
Lehi, "Blessed art thou, Lehi,\
1:28\
because of the things which thou hast\
done." Being a disciple of Jesus Christ\
1:34\
involves more than just hoping or\
believing.\
1:37\
It calls for effort, movement, and\
commitment.\
1:40\
It requires that we do something, being\
doers of the word\
1:45\
and not hearers only.\
1:48\
In the case of the melted ice cream,\
what mattered most?\
1:52\
The ice cream?\
1:53\
Or that my friend simply did something?\
1:57\
I had a sweet experience with a darling\
young woman who asked a very\
2:01\
sincere question.\
2:03\
"Sister Craven, how do you know that\
anything about the Church is true?\
2:08\
Because I feel nothing.”\
2:11\
Before jumping to an answer, I first\
asked her some questions.\
2:14\
"Tell me about your personal scripture\
study." She replied, "I don't read\
2:19\
the scriptures." I asked, "What about\
with your family?\
2:22\
Do you study Come Follow Me together?”\
She said, “No.”\
2:27\
I asked about her prayers.\
2:29\
"What do you feel when you pray?" Her\
answer: "I don't pray." My response to\
2:36\
her was simple: "If you want to know\
anything, you will have to do\
2:43\
something." Isn't that true with\
anything we want to learn or know?\
2:48\
I invited my new friend to start doing\
the gospel of Jesus Christ:\
2:52\
praying, studying, serving others, and\
trusting in the Lord.\
2:56\
Conversion won't come while doing\
nothing.\
3:00\
It comes through the power of the Holy\
Ghost as we intentionally make\
3:04\
an effort by asking, seeking, and\
knocking.\
3:08\
It comes by doing.\
3:11\
In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord\
occasionally says, "It\
3:14\
mattereth not." It makes me ponder that\
if some things matter not or matter\
3:21\
less, there must be things that matter\
most.\
3:26\
In our efforts to do something or do\
anything, we might ask ourselves what\
3:32\
matters most.\
3:34\
Advertisers often use slogans such as\
"essential" or "must have" in hopes\
3:39\
of luring us to believe the product they\
are selling is necessary for our\
3:44\
happiness or well-being.\
3:46\
But is what they are selling really\
essential?\
3:49\
Must we really have it?\
3:51\
Does it really matter?\
3:53\
Here are some thoughts to consider.\
3:56\
What mattereth most- How many likes we\
get on our social media posts?\
4:02\
Or how much we are loved and valued by\
our Heavenly Father?\
4:07\
Wearing the latest trend in clothing or\
showing respect for our bodies by\
4:12\
dressing modestly?\
4:14\
Finding answers through an Internet\
search or receiving answers from God\
4:19\
through the Holy Ghost?\
4:21\
Wanting more or being content with what\
we have been given?\
4:27\
President Russell M.\
4:28\
Nelson teaches, "With the Holy Ghost as\
your companion, you can see right\
4:34\
through the celebrity culture that has\
smitten our society.\
4:38\
You can be smarter than previous\
generations have ever been.\
4:42\
Set a standard for the rest of the\
world." It takes effort to stay\
4:48\
focused on what is truly essential for\
lasting joy.\
4:52\
Satan would love nothing more than for\
us to misplace our eternal\
4:57\
values, leading us to waste precious\
time, talents, or spiritual strength\
5:02\
on things that matter not.\
5:05\
I invite each of us to prayerfully\
consider those things that distract us\
5:10\
from doing what mattereth most.\
5:14\
Our oldest son's third grade teacher\
taught her class to boss your brain.\
5:19\
It was a reminder to her young students\
that they were in control of their\
5:24\
thoughts and could therefore control\
what they do.\
5:29\
I remind myself to boss my brain when I\
find myself drifting towards things\
5:34\
that matter less.\
5:36\
A high school student recently told me\
that it has become popular among some\
5:41\
youth of the church to disregard the\
commandments with a calculated plan\
5:45\
to repent later.\
5:47\
It's sort of a badge of honor, I was\
told.\
5:50\
Certainly the Lord will continue to\
forgive those who humbly repent with\
5:55\
real intent.\
5:57\
But the Savior’s merciful Atonement\
6:00\
should never be used in \
such a mocking way.\
6:04\
We know the parable of the one lost\
sheep.\
6:07\
Of course, a shepherd will leave the\
other 99 sheep to find the one who\
6:10\
is strayed.\
6:12\
But can you imagine the joy that those\
who choose to be the 99 bring to\
6:18\
the Good Shepherd, the ones who stick\
together and help each other and live\
6:22\
their covenants?\
6:23\
Can you visualize what the world or your\
school or your work or your\
6:28\
home would be like if being obedient was\
the popular thing to do?\
6:34\
It's not about doing life perfectly.\
6:37\
It's about finding joy while doing our\
best to live the covenants we have made\
6:42\
with the Lord.\
6:44\
With a world expressing more doubt about\
God and confusion and pressures\
6:50\
increasing, this is the time we must\
stay closest to the Prophet.\
6:56\
As the Lord's mouthpiece, we can trust\
that what he urges, counsels,\
7:01\
and pleads with us to do are things that\
matter most.\
7:07\
Although it may not be easy, there is\
always a way to do the right thing.\
7:15\
While talking with a group of friends at\
school, a young woman's heart\
7:19\
dropped when the conversation turned to\
criticizing the standards of\
7:22\
the Church.\
7:23\
She realized she couldn't stay silent.\
7:26\
She had to do something.\
7:29\
Respectfully, she spoke of the love of\
Heavenly Father and how\
7:33\
the commandments He set are to bless and\
protect His children.\
7:38\
It would have been much easier for her\
to do nothing.\
7:42\
But what mattered most?\
7:43\
Blending in with a crowd or standing as\
a witness of God at all times\
7:48\
and in all things and in all places?\
7:52\
If the restored Church of Jesus Christ\
is going to come out of\
7:56\
obscurity, we must come out of\
obscurity.\
8:00\
As covenant-keeping women, we must shine\
our gospel light all over\
8:06\
the world by stepping up and standing\
out.\
8:09\
We do this together as daughters of God.\
8:12\
A force of 8.2 million women, ages 11\
and beyond, whose work is exactly\
8:19\
the same.\
8:21\
We are gathering Israel as we\
participate in the work of salvation\
8:25\
and exaltation, striving to live the\
gospel of Jesus Christ, caring\
8:29\
for others in need, inviting all to\
receive the gospel and uniting families\
8:34\
for eternity.\
8:36\
The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel\
of action and a gospel of joy.\
8:43\
Let us not underestimate our capacity to\
do those things that matter most.\
8:48\
Our divine heritage gives us courage and\
confidence to do and be all that\
8:55\
our loving, loving Heavenly Father knows\
we can be.\
8:59\
The youth theme for this year is from\
Proverbs 3:5–6.\
9:03\
“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart;\
9:05\
and lean not unto thine own\
understanding.\
9:09\
In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he\
shall direct thy paths." A\
9:14\
key component of trusting in the Lord is\
moving forward, believing He will\
9:19\
guide us even when we don't have all the\
answers.\
9:24\
Sisters, it is not about the ice cream,\
and it is not about doing more.\
9:32\
It's about doing what matters.\
9:34\
It's applying the doctrine of Christ in\
our lives as we strive to become more\
9:39\
like Him.\
9:41\
The more we do to stay firmly on the\
covenant path, the more our faith\
9:46\
in Jesus Christ will grow.\
9:49\
The more our faith grows, the more we\
will desire to repent.\
9:53\
And the more we repent, the more we will\
strengthen our covenant\
9:57\
relationship with God.\
10:00\
That covenant relationship draws us to\
the temple, because keeping temple\
10:05\
covenants is how we endure to the end.\
10:10\
If and as we center our lives on Jesus\
Christ, we will be guided to do what\
10:18\
mattereth most, and we will be blessed\
with spiritual strength,\
10:24\
contentment, and with joy!\
10:28\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
