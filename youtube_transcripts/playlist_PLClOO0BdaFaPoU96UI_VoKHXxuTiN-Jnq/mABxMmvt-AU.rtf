Sisters, what a joy it is to be gathered\
with each of you in this\
0:07\
women's session of General Conference.\
0:11\
I grew up in western New York and\
attended a small branch of\
0:15\
the Church about 20 miles from our home.\
0:19\
As I sat in Sunday School class in the\
basement of our old rented chapel\
0:26\
with only my friend Patti Cho, I never\
could have imagined being part of\
0:31\
a global sisterhood of millions of\
women.\
0:37\
Five years ago, my husband Bruce became\
seriously ill when we were serving with\
0:43\
the consecrated saints in the Europe\
East Area.\
0:48\
We returned home, and he passed away\
only a few weeks later.\
0:54\
My life changed overnight.\
0:57\
I was grieving and felt weak and\
vulnerable.\
1:01\
I pled with the Lord to direct my path.\
1:06\
What would Thou have me do?\
1:10\
A few weeks later, I was going through\
my mail when a small picture in\
1:14\
a catalog caught my eye.\
1:17\
As I looked closer, I realized it was an\
artist's rendition of the Samaritan\
1:23\
woman with Jesus at the well.\
1:27\
At that moment, the Spirit spoke clearly\
to me.\
1:33\
That is what you are supposed to do.\
1:38\
A loving Heavenly Father was inviting me\
to come to the Savior and learn.\
1:45\
I would like to share with you three\
lessons I am learning as I continue to\
1:50\
drink from His well of living water.\
1:55\
First, our past and present\
circumstances\
2:01\
do not determine our future.\
2:06\
Sisters, I know that many of you feel,\
as I did, unsure how to face\
2:11\
difficult challenges and loss.\
2:14\
Loss because your life is not unfolding\
in the way you had hoped for, prayed\
2:20\
for, and planned for.\
2:24\
No matter our circumstances, our lives\
are sacred and have meaning\
2:29\
and purpose.\
2:31\
Each of us is a beloved daughter of God,\
born with divinity in our souls.\
2:38\
Our Savior, Jesus Christ, through His\
atoning sacrifice, made it possible\
2:44\
for us to be cleansed and healed and\
enabling us to fulfill our purpose\
2:51\
on Earth, regardless of decisions of\
family members, our marital\
2:58\
status, physical or mental health, or\
any other situation.\
3:05\
Consider the woman at the well.\
3:07\
What was her life like?\
3:10\
Jesus perceived that she had had five\
husbands and was currently not married\
3:15\
to the man she was living with.\
3:17\
And yet, despite her life's\
difficulties, one of the Savior's first\
3:24\
public declarations that He was the\
Messiah was to her.\
3:30\
He said I, that speak unto thee, am He.\
3:36\
She became a powerful witness, declaring\
to those in her city that\
3:41\
Jesus was the Christ.\
3:43\
And many of the Samaritans of that city\
believed on Him for the saying of\
3:50\
the woman.\
3:51\
Her past and present circumstances did\
not determine her future.\
3:56\
Like her, we can choose to turn to the\
Savior today for the strength\
4:02\
and healing that will\
enable us to fulfill\
4:07\
all that we were sent here to do.\
4:12\
Second, the power is in us.\
4:17\
In a familiar verse in the Doctrine and\
Covenants, the Lord encourages\
4:20\
women and men to be anxiously engaged in\
a good cause and do many things of\
4:26\
their own free will and bring to pass\
much righteousness,\
4:31\
for the power is in them.\
4:35\
Sisters, the power is in us to bring to\
pass much righteousness.\
4:41\
President Russell M.\
4:42\
Nelson testified every woman and every\
man who makes covenants with God\
4:50\
and keeps those covenants and who\
participates worthily in priesthood\
4:55\
ordinances, has direct access to the\
power of God.\
5:01\
I have come to know that as we strive to\
honor sacred covenants made at\
5:06\
baptism and in holy temples, the Lord\
will bless us with His healing\
5:13\
strengthening power and \
with spiritual insights\
5:17\
and awakenings weâ€™ve never had before.\
5:23\
Third, out of small things proceedeth\
that which is great.\
5:29\
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught\
His disciples, "Ye are the salt\
5:34\
of the earth, and ye are the light of\
the world." Later, he compared\
5:41\
the growth of the kingdom of heaven to\
leaven, which a woman took and hid in\
5:47\
three measures of meal until the whole\
was leavened.\
5:53\
Salt, leaven, light: Even in \
very small amounts,\
6:00\
each affects everything around them.\
6:03\
The Savior invites us to use His power\
to be as salt, leaven, and light.\
6:13\
Salt.\
6:14\
It is surprising how much difference a\
sprinkling of salt makes in\
6:19\
the flavor of what we eat.\
6:21\
And yet, salt is one of the least\
expensive and simplest ingredients.\
6:28\
In the book of 2 Kings, we read of a\
little maid who was captured by\
6:33\
the Syrians and became a servant to the\
wife of Naaman, captain of\
6:39\
the Syrian army.\
6:41\
She was as salt.\
6:44\
She was young, of no worldly importance,\
and her life is a slave in\
6:48\
a foreign country was clearly not what\
she had hoped for.\
6:53\
However, she spoke two sentences with\
the power of God, testifying to\
7:01\
Norman's wife: "Would God, my Lord, were\
with the prophet that is in\
7:06\
Samaria, for He would recover him of his\
leprosy.\
7:13\
Her words of faith were relayed to\
Naaman, who acted on her\
7:16\
words, allowing him to be healed, both\
physically\
7:22\
and spiritually.\
7:25\
We often focus on the servants who\
convinced Naaman to bathe in the River\
7:30\
Jordan as the prophet Elisha directed.\
7:34\
But Naaman would not have even been at\
Elisha's door without a little maid.\
7:44\
You may be young or feel of no\
importance, but you can be as salt in\
7:50\
your family, at school, and in your\
community.\
7:55\
Leaven.\
7:57\
Have you ever eaten bread without\
leaven?\
8:00\
How would you describe it?\
8:02\
Dense, heavy, hard.\
8:05\
With only a small amount of leaven,\
bread rises, expanding to\
8:09\
become lighter and softer.\
8:12\
When we invite the power of God into our\
lives, we can replace the spirit of\
8:18\
heaviness with inspired perspectives\
that lift others and make room\
8:26\
for hearts to be healed.\
8:30\
Recently a friend of mine lay in bed on\
Christmas morning, overcome with sorrow.\
8:35\
Her children begged her to get up.\
8:38\
However, she was filled with the pain of\
her pending divorce.\
8:42\
Lying in bed, sobbing, she poured out\
her soul in prayer to her Heavenly\
8:47\
Father, telling Him of her despair.\
8:52\
As she concluded her prayer, the Spirit\
whispered to her that God\
8:55\
knew her pain.\
8:57\
She was filled with His compassion for\
her.\
9:04\
This sacred experience validated her\
emotions and gave her hope that she was\
9:09\
not grieving alone.\
9:12\
She got up, went outside, and built a\
snowman with her children, replacing\
9:18\
the heaviness of the morning with\
laughter and joy.\
9:25\
Light.\
9:26\
How much light does it take to pierce\
the darkness in a room?\
9:30\
One small ray, and that ray of light in\
a dark place can emanate from\
9:38\
the power of God in you.\
9:42\
Even though you may feel alone as the\
storms of life are raging, you can\
9:48\
shine a light in the darkness of\
misunderstanding, confusion,\
9:54\
and unbelief.\
9:55\
Your light of faith in Christ can be\
steady and sure, leading those around\
10:01\
you to safety and peace.\
10:05\
Sisters, hearts can be changed and lives\
blessed as we offer a pinch\
10:13\
of salt, a spoonful of leaven, and a ray\
of light.\
10:19\
I testify that the Savior is the salt in\
our lives, inviting us to taste of\
10:27\
His joy and love.\
10:30\
It is He who is the leaven when our\
lives are hard, bringing us hope\
10:36\
and lifting our burdens through His\
matchless power and redeeming love.\
10:42\
He is our light, illuminating our path\
back home.\
10:48\
I pray that we can come to the Savior.\
10:51\
Like the woman at the well and drink of\
His living water.\
10:57\
With the people of Samaria, we can then\
declare, "Now we believe, for we have\
11:03\
heard Him ourselves and know that this\
is indeed the Christ, the Savior of\
11:10\
the world." In the name of Jesus Christ,\
amen.\
