My dear brothers and sisters,\
0:02\
this conference has been\
historic in many ways.\
0:06\
We have been blessed by the prayers,\
messages, and music.\
0:13\
We have been inspired by servants of the\
Lord.\
0:17\
We've received important direction for\
the future.\
0:21\
My prayer is that the Spirit has spoken\
to you directly about things the Lord\
0:27\
would have you do.\
0:31\
The future is always uncertain.\
0:35\
Weather changes.\
0:37\
Economic cycles are unpredictable.\
0:41\
Disasters, wars, and accidents, Illness\
can change life quickly.\
0:49\
These actions are largely beyond our\
control, but there are some things we\
0:53\
can control, including how we spend our\
time each day.\
1:02\
I like this poem by Henry Van Dyke,\
posted on a sundial at Wells\
1:08\
College in New York.\
1:11\
It reads: “The shadow by my finger cast\
Divides the future from the past:\
1:22\
Before it, sleeps the unborn hour,\
In darkness, and beyond thy power.\
1:32\
Behind its unreturning line, The\
vanished hour, no longer\
1:37\
thine: One hour alone is in thy hands.\
1:44\
The NOW on which the shadow stands."\
1:51\
Yes, we should learn from the past.\
1:53\
Yes, we should prepare for the future.\
1:56\
But only now can we do.\
2:00\
Now is the time we can learn.\
2:02\
Now is the time we can repent.\
2:05\
Now is the time.\
2:06\
We can bless others and "lift up the\
hands which hang down."\
2:12\
As Mormon counseled his son Moroni, "Let\
us labor\
2:17\
diligently, for we have a labor to\
perform [while] in this tabernacle of\
2:21\
clay, that we may conquer the enemy of\
all righteousness, and rest our souls\
2:30\
in the Kingdom of God."\
2:34\
The adversary never sleeps.\
2:37\
There will always be opposition to the\
truth.\
2:42\
I repeat my urging from this morning to\
do those things that will increase your\
2:47\
positive spiritual momentum,\
2:51\
that lift that President Uchtdorf\
was talking about.\
2:55\
That’ll keep you moving\
forward through whatever\
2:57\
challenges and opportunities come.\
3:01\
Positive spiritual momentum increases as\
we worship in the temple and grow in\
3:09\
our understanding of the magnificent\
breadth and depth of the blessings we\
3:13\
receive there.\
3:17\
I plead with you to counter worldly ways\
by focusing on the eternal\
3:21\
blessings of the temple.\
3:24\
Your time there brings blessings for\
eternity.\
3:30\
As the Church grows, we strive to keep\
pace by building more temples.\
3:38\
44 new temples are presently under\
construction.\
3:43\
More are being renewed.\
3:46\
I pray for the skilled people who work\
on those projects across the world.\
3:55\
In the spirit of prayerful gratitude, I\
am pleased to announce our\
4:01\
plans to build a new temple in each of\
the following locations:\
4:10\
Wellington, New Zealand.\
4:13\
Brazzaville, Republic of Congo.\
4:17\
Barcelona, Spain.\
4:21\
Birmingham, United Kingdom.\
4:24\
Cusco, Perú.\
4:27\
Maceió, Brazil.\
4:30\

4:53\

4:56\

Montpelier, Idaho.\
5:02\
Modesto, California.\
5:05\
These 17 temples will bless countless\
lives on both sides of the veil.\
5:11\
I love you, my dear brothers and\
sisters.\
5:14\
And more importantly, the Lord loves\
you.\
5:17\
He's your Savior and your Redeemer.\
5:21\
He leads and guides His Church.\
5:25\
May we be a people worthy of the Lord\
who said, "Ye shall be my\
5:31\
people, and I will be your God." For\
this I pray in the sacred name of Jesus\
5:39\
Christ, amen.\
