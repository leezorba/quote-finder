Thank you, choir.\
0:03\
Thank you so much, choir, and thank you,\
President Nelson, for this\
0:08\
wonderful and great conference.\
0:12\
We look forward to hear more of you\
today.\
0:16\
Just days before He gave His life for\
us, Jesus Christ was at the temple\
0:23\
in Jerusalem, watching people make\
donations to the temple treasury.\
0:28\
Many that were rich cast in much, but\
then, along came a poor\
0:32\
widow, and she threw in two mites.\
0:36\
It was such a small amount it would\
hardly be worth recalling.\
0:42\
And yet, this seemingly inconsequential\
donation caught the Savior's attention.\
0:48\
In fact, it impressed Him so deeply that\
He called unto His disciples\
0:54\
and said unto them, "Verily, I say unto\
you that this poor widow hath cast more\
1:00\
in than all they which have cast into\
the Treasury.\
1:05\
For all they did cast in of their\
abundance; but she of her want did cast\
1:13\
in all that she had, even all her\
living.\
1:18\
With this simple observation, the Savior\
taught us how offerings are\
1:23\
measured in His kingdom.\
1:26\
And it's quite different from the way we\
usually measure things to the Lord.\
1:33\
The value of the donation was measured\
not by the effect it had on\
1:37\
the treasury, but by the effect it had\
on the donor.\
1:44\
In praising this faithful widow, the\
Savior gave us a standard to\
1:48\
measure our discipleship in all of its\
many expressions.\
1:54\
Jesus taught that our offering may be\
large or may be small, but either way\
2:02\
it must be our heartfelt all.\
2:07\
This principle is echoed in the plea of\
the Book of Mormon prophet\
2:11\
Amaleki: "Come unto Christ, who is the\
holy one of Israel, and partake of\
2:19\
his salvation and the power of his\
redemption.\
2:24\
Yea, come onto him, and offer your whole\
souls as an offering unto him."\
2:30\
But how is this possible?\
2:32\
To many of us, such a standard of whole-\
souled commitment seems out of reach.\
2:39\
We are already stretched so thin.\
2:42\
How can we balance the many demands of\
life with our desires to offer our\
2:48\
whole souls to the Lord?\
2:50\
Perhaps our challenge is that we think\
balance means dividing our time evenly\
2:58\
among competing interests.\
3:01\
Viewed in this way, our commitment to\
Jesus Christ would be one of many\
3:06\
things we need to fit into our busy\
schedules.\
3:10\
But perhaps there's another way to look\
at it.\
3:15\
My wife, Harriet, and I love to go\
bicycle riding together.\
3:20\
It’s a wonderful way to get some\
exercise while also\
3:24\
spending time together.\
3:26\
We wait-while we are riding, and I'm not\
huffing and puffing too\
3:30\
much, we enjoy the beautiful world\
around us and even engage in\
3:36\
a pleasant conversation.\
3:39\
Rarely do we have to pay much attention\
to keeping our balance on our bicycles.\
3:45\
We've been riding long enough that we\
don't even think about that.\
3:50\
It has become normal and natural for us.\
3:53\
But whenever I watch someone learning to\
ride a bike for the first\
3:58\
time, I’m reminded that it’s not easy\
4:02\
balancing yourself on those\
two narrow wheels.\
4:08\
It takes time.\
4:10\
It takes practice.\
4:11\
It takes patience.\
4:14\
It even takes falling down a time or\
two.\
4:18\
Most of all, those who succeed in\
balancing on a bicycle learned these\
4:24\
important tips: Don't look at your feet.\
4:27\
Look ahead.\
4:28\
Keep your eyes on the road in front of\
you.\
4:31\
Focus on your destination, and get\
pedaling.\
4:36\
Staying balanced is all about moving\
forward.\
4:40\
Similar principles apply when it comes\
to finding balance in our lives\
4:44\
as disciples of Jesus Christ.\
4:48\
To distribute your time and energy among\
your many important tasks will\
4:54\
vary from person to person and from one\
season of life to another.\
5:01\
But our common overall objective is to\
follow the way of our Master, Jesus\
5:08\
Christ, and return to the presence of\
our beloved Father in Heaven.\
5:14\
This objective must remain constant and\
consistent, whoever we are\
5:23\
and whatever else is happening in our\
lives.\
5:27\
Now, for those who are avid bicyclists\
comparing discipleship to riding\
5:36\
a bike may be a helpful analogy.\
5:40\
For those who are not, don't worry.\
5:43\
I have another analogy.\
5:44\
I'm sure every man, every woman, and\
every child will be able to\
5:48\
relate to.\
5:50\
Discipleship, like most things in life,\
can also be compared to flying\
5:56\
an airplane.\
6:01\
Have you ever stopped to think how\
amazing it is that a huge passenger jet\
6:06\
can actually get off the ground and fly?\
6:10\
What is it that keeps these flying\
machines soaring elegantly through\
6:15\
the sky, crossing oceans and continents?\
6:19\
Put simply, an aircraft flies only when\
air is moving over its wings.\
6:27\
That movement creates differences in air\
pressure that gives the plane lift.\
6:33\
And how to get-how do you get enough air\
moving over the wings to create lift?\
6:39\
How is that done?\
6:40\
The answer is forward thrust.\
6:44\
The airplane gains no altitude sitting\
on the runway.\
6:48\
Even on a windy day, enough lift isn't\
created unless the airplane is moving\
6:53\
forward with enough thrust to counteract\
the forces holding it back.\
7:02\
Just as forward momentum keeps a bicycle\
balanced upright, moving\
7:11\
forward helps an aircraft overcome the\
pull of gravity and drag.\
7:19\
What does this mean for us as disciples\
of Jesus Christ?\
7:23\
It means that if we want to find balance\
in life, and if we want\
7:29\
the Savior to lift us heavenward, then\
our commitment to Him\
7:34\
and His gospel can't be casual or\
occasional.\
7:39\
Like the widow at Jerusalem, we must\
offer Him our whole souls.\
7:47\
Our offering may be small, but it must\
come from our heart and soul.\
7:53\
Being a disciple of Jesus Christ is not\
just one of many things we do.\
7:59\
The Savior is the motivating power\
behind all that we do.\
8:04\
He is not a rest stop in our journey.\
8:06\
He's not a scenic byway or even a major\
landmark.\
8:11\
He is "the way, the truth, and the life:\
no man cometh unto\
8:18\
the Father but by [Jesus Christ]." That\
is the way and our ultimate destination.\
8:27\
Balance and lift come as we "press\
forward with the steadfastness in\
8:32\
Christ, having a perfect brightness of\
hope and a love of God and of all men."\
8:39\
And what about the many tasks and the\
responsibilities that make our\
8:43\
lives so busy?\
8:45\
Spending time with loved ones, going to\
school or preparing for an\
8:50\
occupation, earning a living, caring for\
family, serving in the community-\
8:56\
where does it all fit in?\
9:00\
The Savior reassures us: "Your Heavenly\
Father knows that you have need of all\
9:05\
these things, but seek first the Kingdom\
of God and His\
9:12\
righteousness, and all these things\
shall be added unto you." But that\
9:19\
doesn't mean it's easy.\
9:21\
It requires both sacrifice and\
consecration.\
9:27\
It requires letting some things go and\
letting other things grow.\
9:34\
Sacrifice and consecration are two\
heavenly laws that we covenant to obey\
9:41\
in the holy temple.\
9:42\
These two laws are similar but not\
identical.\
9:48\
To sacrifice means to give something up\
in favor of something more valuable.\
9:55\
Anciently, God's people sacrifice the\
firstlings of the flocks in honor\
9:59\
of the coming Messiah.\
10:01\
Throughout history, faithful Saints have\
sacrificed personal\
10:05\
desires, comforts, and even their lives\
for the Savior.\
10:11\
We all have things large and small we\
need to sacrifice in order to follow\
10:17\
Jesus Christ more completely.\
10:20\
Our sacrifices show what we truly value.\
10:25\
Sacrifices are sacred and honored by the\
Lord.\
10:30\
Consecration is different from sacrifice\
in at least one important way.\
10:36\
When we consecrate something,\
10:39\
we don’t leave it to be\
consumed upon the altar.\
10:43\
Rather, we put it to use \
in the Lord’s service.\
10:47\
We dedicate it to Him\
and His holy purposes.\
10:52\
We receive the talents that the Lord has\
given us and strive to increase\
10:57\
them manifold to become even more\
helpful in building the Lord's kingdom.\
11:05\
Very few of us will ever be asked to\
sacrifice our lives for the\
11:10\
Savior, but we are all invited to\
consecrate our lives to Him as we seek\
11:20\
to purify our lives and look unto Christ\
in every thought.\
11:25\
Everything else begins to align.\
11:29\
Life no longer feels- no longer feels\
like a long list of separate efforts\
11:34\
held in tenuous balance.\
11:36\
Over time, it all becomes one work, one\
joy, one holy purpose.\
11:45\
It is the work of loving and serving\
God.\
11:48\
It is loving and serving God's children.\
11:52\
When we look at our lives and see a\
hundred things to do,\
11:57\
we feel overwhelmed.\
11:59\
When we see one thing- loving and\
serving God and His children in\
12:05\
a hundred different ways- then we can\
work on those things with joy.\
12:13\
This is how we offer our whole souls-by\
sacrificing anything that's holding us\
12:19\
back and consecrating the rest to the\
Lord and His purposes.\
12:25\
There will be times, my dear brothers\
and sisters and my dear\
12:30\
friends, when you wish you could do\
more.\
12:34\
Your loving Father in Heaven knows your\
heart.\
12:37\
He knows that you can't do everything\
your heart wants you to do.\
12:41\
But you can love and serve God.\
12:45\
You can do your best to keep His\
commandments.\
12:48\
You can love and serve His children.\
12:51\
And your efforts are\
purifying your heart\
12:55\
and preparing you for a glorious future.\
12:59\
This is what the widow at the Temple\
Treasury seemed to understand.\
13:04\
She surely knew that her offering would\
not change the fortunes of\
13:10\
Israel, but it could change\
and bless her,\
13:15\
because, though small, it was her all.\
13:19\
So my dear friends and beloved fellow\
disciples of Jesus Christ, let us not\
13:25\
be "weary in well-doing," for we are\
laying the foundation of a great work\
13:31\
and out of small things will proceed\
that which is great.\
13:37\
I testify that this is true, as I also\
testify that Jesus Christ is our\
13:44\
Master, our Redeemer, and He's the only\
way and the one way back to\
13:54\
our beloved Father in Heaven.\
13:57\
In the sacred name of Jesus Christ,\
amen.\
