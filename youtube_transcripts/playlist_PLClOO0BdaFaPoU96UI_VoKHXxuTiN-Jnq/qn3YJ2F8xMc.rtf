Marin, I'm Elder Holland, and things are\
about to go downhill.\
0:14\
We are all intrigued by survival\
stories.\
0:19\
We hear tales of intrepid explorers and\
ordinary people alike who managed\
0:25\
to keep themselves alive against all\
odds and expectations, and we can't\
0:30\
help but ask ourselves, "Could I have\
done that?" I think immediately of\
0:36\
British explorer Ernest Shackleton and\
the crew of his ship HMS Endurance\
0:41\
shipwrecked in Antarctic ice and then\
stranded on a barren island for nearly\
0:46\
two years.\
0:47\
Shackleton's extraordinary leadership\
and indomitable resolve saved\
0:52\
the lives of his men despite the\
harshest conditions.\
0:56\
Then I think of the crew of Apollo 13\
hurtling through space to land on\
1:02\
the moon.\
1:03\
But disaster struck when an oxygen tank\
explosion exploded, and the mission had\
1:08\
to be aborted.\
1:09\
Short of oxygen, the crew and mission\
control ingeniously improvised\
1:14\
and brought all three astronauts safely\
back to earth.\
1:19\
I marvel at the astonishing survival of\
individuals and families victimized by\
1:24\
war, imprisoned in camps, and those who\
become refugees who heroically\
1:30\
and courageously keep alive the flame of\
hope for fellow sufferers, who\
1:35\
impart goodness in the face of\
brutality, and who somehow managed to\
1:40\
help others endure just one more day.\
1:44\
Could you or I survive in any one of\
these extreme circumstances?\
1:51\
Perhaps some of you, however, consider\
these accounts of survivors and your\
1:56\
soul cries out that you are living a\
survival story right now as a victim\
2:03\
of abuse, neglect, bullying, domestic\
violence, or any suffering of this kind.\
2:11\
You are in the midst of your own\
desperate attempt to survive\
2:15\
a situation that feels very much like a\
disastrous shipwreck or a promising\
2:19\
mission suddenly aborted.\
2:21\
Will you ever be rescued?\
2:23\
Will you make it through your own\
survival story?\
2:28\
The answer is yes.\
2:30\
You can survive.\
2:31\
You have, in fact, already been rescued.\
2:34\
You have already been saved by the one\
who has suffered the very torment you\
2:40\
are suffering and endured the very agony\
you are enduring.\
2:46\
Jesus has overcome the abuses of this\
world to give you power to not only\
2:53\
survive, but one day, through Him, to\
overcome and even conquer- to\
3:00\
completely rise above the pain, the\
misery, the anguish- and see\
3:05\
them replaced by peace.\
3:09\
The Apostle Paul asks, "Who shall\
separate us from the love of Christ?\
3:15\
shall tribulation, or distress, or\
persecution, or\
3:18\
famine, or nakedness, or peril,\
or sword? ...\
3:22\
Nay, in all these things we are more\
than conquerors\
3:29\
through him that loved us."\
3:33\
You'll remember when President Nelson\
issued the following invitation in\
3:37\
general conference.\
3:38\
He said, “As you study \
your scriptures...,\
3:41\
I encourage you to make a list of all\
that the Lord has promised He will do\
3:46\
for covenant Israel.\
3:48\
I think you will be astounded!" Here are\
just a few of the\
3:52\
powerful, comforting promises our family\
found.\
3:56\
Imagine the Lord speaking these words to\
you- to you who are\
4:01\
surviving-because they are for you.\
4:05\
Fear not.\
4:08\
I know your sorrows, and I have come to\
deliver you.\
4:12\
I will not leave you.\
4:14\
My name is upon you, and my angels have\
charge over you.\
4:19\
I will do wonders among you.\
4:21\
Walk with me; learn of me.\
4:24\
I will give you rest.\
4:26\
I am in your midst.\
4:29\
You are mine.\
4:33\
With those assurances very much in mind,\
I want to speak directly to those\
4:38\
who feel as though there is no way out\
of their survival story because of\
4:43\
the trauma inflicted by the cruel\
actions of others.\
4:47\
If this is your survival story, we weep\
with you.\
4:51\
We yearn for you to overcome the\
confusion, shame, and fear\
4:56\
and long for you, through Jesus Christ,\
to conquer.\
5:01\
If you have experienced any kind of\
abuse, violence, or\
5:06\
oppression, you may be left with the\
idea that these events were somehow\
5:10\
your fault and that you deserve to carry\
the shame and guilt you feel.\
5:15\
You may have had thoughts such as: "I\
could have prevented this." "God\
5:21\
doesn't love me anymore." "Nobody will\
ever love me." "I am damaged beyond\
5:26\
repair." "The Savior's Atonement applies\
to others but not to me." These\
5:34\
erroneous thoughts and feelings may have\
been a barrier to seeking help\
5:39\
from family, friends, leaders, or\
professionals, and so you have\
5:43\
struggled alone.\
5:45\
If you have sought help from those you\
trust, you may still be wrestling with\
5:49\
ideas of shame and even self-loathing.\
5:53\
The impact of these events can remain\
for many years.\
5:59\
You hope that one day you will feel\
better, but somehow that day has not\
6:04\
yet come.\
6:07\
The abuse was not, is not, and never\
will be your fault, no matter what\
6:12\
the abuser or anyone else may have said\
to the contrary.\
6:15\
When you have been the victim of\
cruelty, incest, or any other\
6:19\
perversion, you are not the one who\
needs to repent.\
6:23\
You are not responsible.\
6:25\
You are not less worthy or less valuable\
or less loved as a human being\
6:31\
or as a daughter or son of God because\
of what someone else has done\
6:36\
to you.\
6:37\
God does not now nor has He ever seen\
you as someone to be despised.\
6:44\
Whatever has happened to you, He is not\
ashamed of you or disappointed in you.\
6:50\
He loves you in a way you have yet to\
discover.\
6:54\
And you will discover it as you trust in\
His promises and as you learn to\
6:59\
believe Him when He says you are\
"precious in [His] sight." You are not\
7:07\
defined by these terrible things that\
have been done to you.\
7:10\
You are, in glorious truth, defined by\
your eternally existing identity as\
7:16\
a son or daughter of God, by your\
Creator's perfect, infinite love\
7:22\
and invitation to whole and complete\
healing.\
7:28\
Though it may seem impossible, feel\
impossible, healing can come through\
7:34\
the miracle of the redemptive might, of\
the Atonement of Jesus\
7:38\
Christ, who is risen with "healing in\
his wings." Our merciful\
7:44\
Savior, victorious over darkness and\
depravity, has power to right all\
7:50\
wrongs, a life-giving truth for those\
wronged by others.\
7:56\
Please know that the Savior has\
descended below all things, even what\
8:01\
has happened to you.\
8:03\
Because of that, He knows exactly what\
real terror and shame feel like\
8:09\
and how it feels to be abandoned and\
broken.\
8:13\
From the depths of His atoning\
suffering, the Savior imparts hope you\
8:20\
thought was lost forever, strength you\
believed you could never\
8:25\
possess, and healing you couldn't\
imagine was possible.\
8:31\
There is no place for any kind of\
abuse-physical, sexual,\
8:36\
emotional, or verbal-in any home, any\
country, or any culture.\
8:41\
Nothing a wife, child, or husband\
8:43\
might do or say makes them\
deserve to be beaten.\
8:47\
No one in any country or culture is ever\
asking for aggression or violence\
8:53\
from someone else in authority or by\
someone who is bigger and stronger.\
8:57\
Those who abuse\
9:00\
and who seek to hide their grievous sins\
may get away with it for a time.\
9:04\
But the Lord, who sees all, knows the\
deeds and thoughts and intents of\
9:08\
the heart.\
9:10\
He is a God of justice, and His divine\
justice will be served.\
9:16\
Miraculously, the Lord is also a God of\
mercy to the truly repentant abusers.\
9:23\
Abusers-including those who were once\
abuse themselves-who confess, forsake\
9:29\
their sin, and do all in their power to\
make recompense and restitution have\
9:34\
access to forgiveness through the\
miracle of the Atonement of Christ.\
9:40\
For the falsely accused, the unspeakable\
gravity of these\
9:43\
accusations brings its own purgatory.\
9:46\
But they, too, are blessed by the\
Savior's vicarious suffering\
9:49\
for them and the knowledge that\
ultimately truth will prevail.\
9:55\
But unrepentant abusers will stand\
before the Lord to account for their\
10:01\
heinous crimes.\
10:03\
The Lord Himself is crystal clear in His\
condemnation of abuse of any kind:\
10:08\
“But whoso shall offend one of\
these little ones..., it were better\
10:13\
for him that a millstone\
were hanged about his\
10:16\
neck, and that he were drowned in the\
depth of the sea.”\
10:20\
Dear friends who\
10:22\
have been so terribly wounded-and for\
that matter, anyone who has borne\
10:27\
the injustices of life- you can have a\
new beginning and a fresh start.\
10:34\
In Gethsemane and on Calvary, Jesus\
“took upon Himself...\
10:38\
all of the anguish and suffering ever\
experienced by you and me," and He has\
10:43\
overcome it all!\
10:45\
With arms outstretched, the Savior\
offers the gift of healing to you.\
10:51\
With courage, patience, and faithful\
focus on Him, before too long, you can\
10:57\
come to fully accept this gift.\
11:00\
You can let go of your pain and leave it\
at his feet.\
11:06\
Your gentle Savior declared, "The thief\
cometh not, but for to steal, and to\
11:12\
kill, and to destroy: I am come that\
[you] might have life, and that [you]\
11:17\
might have it more abundantly." You are\
a survivor.\
11:23\
You can heal, and you can trust that\
with the power and grace of Jesus\
11:28\
Christ, you will overcome and conquer.\
11:32\
Jesus specializes in the seemingly\
impossible.\
11:35\
He came here to make the impossible\
possible, the irredeemable redeemable\
11:41\
to heal the unhealable, to right the\
unrightable, and to promise\
11:46\
the unpromisable.\
11:48\
And He's really good at it.\
11:50\
In fact, He's perfect at it.\
11:54\
In the name of Jesus Christ, our Healer,\
amen.\
