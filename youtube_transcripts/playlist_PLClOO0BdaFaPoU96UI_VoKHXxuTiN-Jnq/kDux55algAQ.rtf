How will life's challenges affect our\
faith in Jesus Christ?\
0:06\
And what effect will our faith have on\
the joy and peace we experience in\
0:10\
this life?\
0:12\
The year was 1977.\
0:14\
The phone rang and the message tore our\
hearts apart.\
0:18\
Carolyn and Doug Tebbs were in the\
process of moving to their new home\
0:21\
after completing graduate school.\
0:24\
The elders quorum had come to load the\
moving van.\
0:27\
Doug, making sure the path was clear\
before backing out, took one last look.\
0:34\
What he could not see was his little\
daughter, Jennie, dart behind\
0:38\
the truck at just the wrong moment.\
0:41\
In an instant, their beloved Jennie was\
gone.\
0:45\
What would happen next?\
0:47\
Would the pain they so deeply felt and\
the inconceivable sense of loss\
0:51\
create an irreconcilable chasm between\
Carolyn and Doug, or would it somehow\
0:56\
bind their hearts together and solidify\
their faith in Heavenly\
0:59\
Father's plan?\
1:01\
The road through the reflections has\
been long and painful, but from\
1:05\
somewhere came the spiritual reserves to\
not lose hope, but to "hold\
1:11\
on [their] way." Somehow, this\
incredible couple became even more\
1:15\
Christlike, more committed, more\
compassionate.\
1:19\
They believed that in His time, God\
would consecrate their\
1:22\
afflictions for their gain.\
1:24\
Though the pain and loss would not and\
could not leave\
1:27\
completely, Carolyn and Doug have been\
comforted by the assurance that by\
1:31\
staying firmly on the covenant path,\
their beloved Jennie would be\
1:36\
theirs forever.\
1:38\
Their example has strengthened my faith\
in the Lord's plan.\
1:42\
We don't see all things; He does.\
1:45\
The Lord told Joseph Smith in Liberty\
Jail that "all these things shall give\
1:50\
thee experience, and shall be for thy\
good.\
1:53\
The Son of Man hath descended below them\
all.\
1:57\
Art thou greater than he?" As we accept\
the Lord's will, He teaches us how to\
2:02\
walk with Him.\
2:03\
As a young missionary serving in Tahiti,\
I was asked to administer to\
2:08\
a sick infant.\
2:09\
We laid our hands on his head and\
blessed him to get better.\
2:13\
His health began to improve, but then he\
fell sick again.\
2:17\
The second time we blessed him, but with\
the same result.\
2:20\
A third request came.\
2:22\
We pleaded with the Lord that His will\
be done.\
2:26\
Shortly after, this little spirit\
returned to his heavenly home.\
2:30\
But we were at peace.\
2:32\
We wanted the infant to live, but the\
Lord had other plans.\
2:36\
Accepting His will in place of our own\
2:39\
is key to finding joy no matter\
our circumstances.\
2:44\
The simple faith we have in Jesus Christ\
as we first begin to learn about\
2:49\
Him can remain in our hearts as we\
confront life's challenges.\
2:54\
Our faith in Him can and will guide us\
through the complexities of life.\
2:59\
Indeed, we will find that there is\
simplicity on the other side of life's\
3:04\
complexities as we remain "[steadfast]\
in Christ, having a perfect brightness\
3:09\
of hope." Part of life's purpose is to\
allow these potential stumbling blocks\
3:14\
to become stepping stones as we climb\
what I call the "Ladder of Faith"-a\
3:20\
ladder because it suggests that faith is\
not static.\
3:24\
It can go up or down according to the\
choices we make.\
3:28\
As we strive to build faith in the\
Savior, we may not fully comprehend\
3:33\
God's love for us, and we may obey His\
laws out of a sense of obligation.\
3:38\
Guilt may even become our primary\
motivator rather than love, and real\
3:43\
connection to Him may not yet have been\
experienced.\
3:47\
As we seek to increase our faith, we may\
be confused by what James taught.\
3:52\
He reminded us that faith without works\
is dead.\
3:55\
We may stumble if we think everything\
depends on us.\
3:59\
An overdependence on ourselves can\
impede our ability to access\
4:04\
the powers of heaven.\
4:06\
But as we move towards true\
faith in Jesus Christ,\
4:09\
our mindset begins to change.\
4:12\
We recognize that obedience and faith in\
the Savior qualify us to have His\
4:17\
Spirit always to be with us.\
4:20\
Obedience is no longer an irritant but\
becomes a quest.\
4:24\
We recognize that obedience to God’s\
commands enables us\
4:28\
to be trusted of Him.\
4:30\
With His trust comes increased light.\
4:33\
This light guides our journey and allows\
us to see more clearly\
4:37\
the path we should take.\
4:39\
But there is more.\
4:41\
As our faith in the Savior increases, we\
observe a subtle shift\
4:47\
that includes a divine understanding of\
our relationship with God- a steady\
4:52\
movement away from "What do I want?" to\
"What does God want?" Like the\
4:58\
Savior, we want to act "not as I will,\
but as thou wilt." We want to do\
5:04\
God's work and be an instrument in His\
hands.\
5:08\
Our progression is an eternal one.\
5:10\
President Nelson has taught there is so\
much more that Heavenly Father wants\
5:14\
us to know.\
5:16\
As we progress, we better understand\
what the Lord taught Joseph\
5:19\
Smith: "For if you keep my commandments,\
you shall receive of His\
5:23\
fulness, and be glorified in me...\
5:25\
I say unto you, you shall receive grace\
for grace." How high we climb on\
5:30\
the Ladder of Faith is our decision.\
5:33\
Elder Anderson taught that, "Faith is\
not by chance, but by choice." We can\
5:38\
choose to make the choices needed to\
increase our faith in the Savior.\
5:44\
Consider the impact of the choices made\
when Laman and Lemuel descended\
5:48\
the Ladder of Faith while Nephi climbed\
higher.\
5:51\
Is there a clearer representation than\
the difference between Nephi's response\
5:56\
of "I will go and do" versus Laman and\
Lemuel, having just seen an\
6:00\
angel, responding with, "How is it\
possible that God will deliver?"\
6:06\
Unbelief blocks our ability to see\
miracles, whereas a mindset of faith in\
6:11\
the Savior unlocks the powers of heaven.\
6:15\
Even when our faith is weak, the Lord's\
hand will always be\
6:19\
stretched out.\
6:20\
Years ago, I received the assignment to\
reorganize a stake in Nigeria.\
6:24\
At the last minute there was a change in\
the date.\
6:27\
There was a man in the stake who had\
decided to skip town for the first\
6:31\
conference date.\
6:32\
He did not want to risk being called as\
the stake president.\
6:36\
While he was away, he was in a terrible\
accident, but he was unharmed.\
6:42\
This caused him to consider why his life\
had been spared.\
6:45\
He revisited the decision he had made.\
6:47\
He repented and humbly attended the new\
conference date.\
6:51\
And yes, he was called to be the new\
stake president.\
6:56\
Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught, \
“Only by aligning our will with God’s\
7:00\
is full happiness to be found.\
7:03\
Anything less results and a lesser\
portion." After doing all things that\
7:08\
lie in our power, then it is time to\
stand still to see the salvation of God.\
7:14\
I saw this while serving as a\
ministering brother\
7:16\
to the McCormick family.\
7:18\
Married for 21 years, Mary Kay served\
faithfully in her callings.\
7:22\
Ken was not a member of the Church and\
had no interest in becoming one.\
7:27\
But loving his wife, he chose to attend\
church with her.\
7:31\
One Sunday, I felt impressed to share my\
testimony with Ken.\
7:35\
I asked him if I could do so.\
7:38\
His response was simple and clear: "No,\
thank you." I was puzzled.\
7:44\
I had felt a prompting and tried to\
follow it.\
7:47\
It was tempting to decide that I had\
done my part.\
7:51\
But after prayer and reflection, I could\
see that, though my\
7:53\
intentions were correct, I had relied\
too much on myself and too little\
7:58\
on the Lord.\
8:00\
Later I returned, but with a different\
mindset.\
8:03\
I would go simply as an instrument in\
the Lord's hands with no other desire\
8:07\
than to follow the Spirit.\
8:09\
Together with my faithful companion,\
Gerald Cardon, we entered\
8:13\
the McCormick home.\
8:15\
Soon after, I felt prompted to invite\
Gerald to sing "I Know that My Redeemer\
8:19\
Lives." He gave me a questioning look,\
but having faith in my\
8:24\
faith, he did it.\
8:26\
A beautiful spirit filled the room.\
8:29\
The prompting came to invite Mary Kay\
and Kristin, their daughter, to share\
8:33\
their testimonies.\
8:35\
As they did so, the Spirit grew\
stronger.\
8:38\
In fact, after Kristin's testimony,\
tears were streaming down\
8:41\
Ken's cheeks.\
8:43\
God had taken over.\
8:45\
Hearts were not just touched, but\
changed forever.\
8:48\
Twenty-one years of unbelief were washed\
away by the power of the Holy Ghost.\
8:52\
A week later, Ken was baptized.\
8:55\
A year later, Ken and Mary Kay were\
sealed in the House of the Lord\
8:59\
for time and for all eternity.\
9:02\
Together, we had experienced what it\
meant to replace our will with\
9:06\
the Lord's will and our faith in Him\
increased.\
9:09\
Please consider a few questions posed by\
God's prophets as you strive to\
9:14\
climb your Ladder of Faith: Am I\
stripped of pride?\
9:20\
Do I give place in my heart for the word\
of God?\
9:23\
Do I allow my afflictions to be\
consecrated for my gain?\
9:27\
Am I willing to let my will be swallowed\
up in the will of\
9:31\
the Father?\
9:32\
If I have felt to sing the song of\
redeeming love, can I feel so now?\
9:38\
Do I let God prevail in my life?\
9:41\
If you find your current path in\
conflict with your faith in\
9:44\
the Savior, then please find your way\
back to Him.\
9:48\
Your exaltation and that of your\
posterity depend upon it.\
9:53\
May we plant the seeds of faith deep in\
our hearts.\
9:56\
May we nourish these seeds as we bind\
ourselves to the Savior by honoring\
10:00\
the covenants we have made with Him.\
10:02\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
