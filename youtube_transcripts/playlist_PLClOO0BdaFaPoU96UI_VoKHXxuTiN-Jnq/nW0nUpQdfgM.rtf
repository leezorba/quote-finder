As young parents, Brother and Sister\
Samad learned the gospel of Jesus\
0:05\
Christ in their simple two-room home in\
Semarang, Indonesia.\
0:11\
Seated around a small table, with a dim\
light that seemed to provide more\
0:15\
mosquitos than illumination, two young\
missionaries taught them eternal truths.\
0:21\
Through sincere prayer and the guidance\
of the Holy\
0:23\
Ghost, they came to believe what they\
were taught and chose to be baptized\
0:28\
and become members of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
0:34\
That decision and their pattern of\
living since has blessed Brother\
0:38\
and Sister Samad and their family in\
every aspect of their lives.\
0:44\
They are among the early pioneer saints\
in Indonesia.\
0:47\
Later, they received the ordinances of\
the temple and Brother Samad served\
0:52\
as the branch president and then\
district president, driving throughout\
0:55\
central Java to fulfill his\
responsibilities.\
0:59\
For the past decade, he has served as\
the first patriarch of\
1:03\
the Surakarta Indonesia Stake.\
1:06\
As one of the missionaries in that\
humble, faith-filled home 49 years\
1:12\
ago, I have witnessed in them what King\
Benjamin taught in the Book of\
1:17\
Mormon: "I would desire that ye should\
consider on the blessed and happy state\
1:23\
of those that keep the commandments of\
God.\
1:26\
For behold, they are blessed in all\
things, both temporal and spiritual."\
1:32\
The blessings that flow into the lives\
of those who follow the example\
1:36\
and teachings of Jesus Christ, who\
choose to be counted among His\
1:40\
disciples, are numerous, joyful, and\
eternal.\
1:46\
Alma's baptismal covenant invitation to\
those gathered at the waters of Mormon\
1:51\
begins with this phrase: "Now, as you\
are desirous to come into the fold of\
1:56\
God." A fold or a sheepfold is a large\
enclosure, often constructed with stone\
2:03\
walls, where the sheep are protected at\
night.\
2:06\
It has only one opening.\
2:08\
At the end of the day, the shepherd\
calls the sheep.\
2:12\
They know his voice, and through the\
gate, they enter the safety of\
2:15\
the fold.\
2:17\
The people of Alma would have known that\
shepherds stand at the narrow\
2:20\
opening of the fold so that when the\
sheep enter, they are\
2:24\
numbered, and their wounds and ailments\
noted and cared for one by one.\
2:30\
The safety and well-being of the sheep\
depend on their willingness to come\
2:34\
into the fold and to stay in the fold.\
2:38\
Among us, there may be some who feel\
they are at the edge of the\
2:41\
flock, perhaps thinking they are less\
needed or valued, or that they don't\
2:46\
belong in the fold.\
2:47\
And as in the sheepfold, in the fold of\
God, we sometimes step on one another's\
2:52\
toes and need to repent or forgive.\
2:56\
But the Good Shepherd, our true\
shepherd, is always good.\
3:01\
Within the fold of God, we experience\
His watchful, nurturing care and are\
3:06\
blessed to feel His redeeming love.\
3:08\
He said, "I have graven thee upon the\
palms of my hands.\
3:13\
Thy walls are continually before me."\
Our Savior has graven upon His\
3:18\
palms, our sins, pains, afflictions, and\
all that is unfair in life.\
3:24\
All are welcome to receive these\
blessings, as they are desirous to come\
3:30\
and choose to be in the fold.\
3:33\
The gift of agency is not simply the\
right to choose.\
3:38\
It is the opportunity\
to choose the right.\
3:42\
And the walls of the fold\
are not a constraint,\
3:45\
but a source of spiritual safety.\
3:49\
Jesus taught that there is one fold and\
one shepherd.\
3:53\
He said: "He that interest in by the\
door is the shepherd of\
3:56\
the sheepâ€¦ and the sheep hear his\
voiceâ€¦ and the sheep follow\
4:00\
him, for they know his voice." Jesus\
then stated, "I am the door.\
4:06\
By me, if any man enter in, he shall be\
saved," teaching clearly that there is\
4:13\
only one way into the fold of God, and\
only one way to be saved.\
4:19\
It is by and through Jesus Christ.\
4:24\
We learn how to come into the fold from\
the word of God, which is the doctrine\
4:28\
taught by Jesus Christ and His prophets.\
4:31\
When we follow the doctrine of Christ\
and come into the fold through faith in\
4:36\
Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism and\
confirmation and continuing\
4:42\
faithfulness, Alma promised four\
specific personal blessings.\
4:48\
You may (1) "be redeemed of God," (2)\
"be numbered with those of\
4:53\
the first resurrection," (3) "have\
eternal life," and (4) the Lord will\
4:59\
"pour out His Spirit more abundantly\
upon you." After Alma taught about\
5:04\
these blessings, the people clapped\
their hands for joy.\
5:08\
Here's why.\
5:10\
First, to redeem means to pay off a debt\
or obligation, or to free from\
5:15\
what distresses or harms.\
5:18\
No amount of personal improvement on our\
part can make us clean from\
5:23\
the sins we have committed or whole from\
the wounds we have suffered\
5:27\
without the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
5:30\
He is our Redeemer.\
5:33\
Second, because of Christ's\
Resurrection, all will be resurrected.\
5:38\
After our spirits depart our mortal\
bodies, we will undoubtedly look\
5:42\
forward to when we can again with a\
resurrected body, embrace those we love.\
5:48\
We will eagerly look forward to being\
among those of the First Resurrection.\
5:54\
Third, eternal life means to live with\
God and as He lives.\
5:59\
It is the greatest of all the gifts of\
God and will bring a fullness of joy.\
6:05\
It is the ultimate purpose and objective\
of our lives.\
6:10\
Fourth, the companionship of a member of\
the Godhead.\
6:13\
The Holy Ghost provides much needed\
guidance and comfort\
6:17\
during this mortal life.\
6:20\
Consider some causes of unhappiness.\
6:23\
Misery comes from sin, sadness and\
loneliness from the death of\
6:27\
a loved one, and fear from the\
uncertainty of what happens when we die.\
6:33\
But when we enter the fold of God and\
keep our covenants with\
6:36\
Him, we feel the peace of knowing and\
trusting that Christ will redeem us\
6:42\
from our sins, that the separation of\
our body and spirit will end more\
6:46\
quickly, and that we will live eternally\
with God in a most glorious manner.\
6:53\
Brothers and sisters, the scriptures are\
filled with examples of\
6:57\
the Savior's majestic power and His\
compassionate mercy and grace.\
7:03\
During His earthly ministry, His\
blessings of healing came to those who\
7:07\
trusted Him and acted in faith.\
7:10\
For example, the infirm man at the pool\
of Bethesda walked\
7:15\
when, with faith, he followed the\
Savior's command to "rise, take up\
7:20\
thy bed, and walk." Those who were sick\
or afflicted in any manner in the land\
7:26\
of Bountiful were healed when with one\
accord they "did go forth." Similarly\
7:33\
to receive the marvelous blessings\
promised to those who come into\
7:37\
the fold of God requires us to do just\
that.\
7:42\
We need to choose to come.\
7:46\
Alma the younger taught, "And now I say\
into you that the good shepherd\
7:51\
doth call after you; and if you will\
hearken onto his voice, he will bring\
7:56\
you into his fold." Several years ago, a\
dear friend passed away from cancer.\
8:03\
When his wife, Sharon, first wrote about\
his diagnosis, she said, "We\
8:08\
choose faith.\
8:10\
Faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
8:13\
Faith in our Heavenly Father's plan.\
8:15\
And faith that He knows our needs and\
fulfills His promises." I have met\
8:21\
many Latter-day Saints like Sharon, who\
feel the inward peace of\
8:26\
being securely within the fold of God,\
especially when\
8:30\
temptation, opposition, or adversity\
comes.\
8:35\
They have chosen to have faith in Jesus\
Christ and to follow His prophet.\
8:40\
Our dear prophet President Russell M\
Nelson has taught, "Everything good in\
8:45\
life, every potential blessing of\
eternal significance begins\
8:51\
with faith."\
8:53\
My great-great-great grandfather, James\
Sawyer\
8:57\
Holman, came to Utah in 1847.\
9:01\
But he wasn't among those to arrive in\
July with Brigham Young.\
9:06\
He came later that year and, according\
to Family Records, was responsible to\
9:11\
bring the sheep.\
9:13\
He didn't reach the Salt Lake Valley\
until October, but he and the sheep\
9:18\
made it.\
9:20\
Figuratively speaking, some of us are\
still on the plains.\
9:24\
Not everyone arrives in the first group.\
9:27\
My dear friends, please continue the\
journey and help others to come\
9:33\
fully into the fold of God.\
9:36\
The blessings of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ are immeasurable, because they\
9:41\
are eternal.\
9:43\
I am profoundly grateful to be a member\
of The Church of Jesus Christ\
9:47\
of Latter-day Saints.\
9:49\
I bear witness of the love of our\
Heavenly Father and our\
9:52\
Redeemer, Jesus Christ, and of the peace\
that comes only from\
9:57\
them, the inner peace and the blessings\
found in the fold of God.\
10:03\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
