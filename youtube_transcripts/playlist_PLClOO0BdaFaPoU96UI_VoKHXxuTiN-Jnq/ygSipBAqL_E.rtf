Dear sisters, thank you for being here.\
0:05\
I'm honored to participate in this\
women's session of general conference.\
0:11\
On occasion, I've also been privileged\
to attend Young Women classes.\
0:16\
But let me point out the obvious: I'm\
not young, and I'm not\
0:23\
a woman.\
0:25\
I learned, however, that I feel less out\
of place if I can recite the Young\
0:29\
Women Theme along with the young women.\
0:32\
The profound doctrine taught in the\
Young Women Theme is important\
0:36\
for young women, but it's applicable to\
all, including those of us who aren't\
0:42\
young women.\
0:44\
The Young Women Theme begins, "I am a\
beloved daughter of heavenly parents\
0:49\
with a divine nature and eternal\
destiny." This statement contains four\
0:55\
important truths.\
0:57\
First, you are a beloved daughter.\
1:01\
Nothing you do or don't do can change\
that.\
1:05\
God loves you because you are His spirit\
daughter.\
1:09\
Sometimes we may not feel His love, but\
it is always there.\
1:14\
God's love is perfect.\
1:17\
Our ability to sense that love is not.\
1:21\
The Spirit plays a pivotal role in\
communicating God's love to us.\
1:27\
Yet the influence of the Holy Ghost can\
be obscured by strong emotions such\
1:32\
as anger, hate, or fear.\
1:37\
Like trying to savor the delicate flavor\
of a grape while eating\
1:42\
a jalapeño pepper, one flavor completely\
overpowers the other.\
1:49\
So, too, behaviors that distance us from\
the Holy Ghost, including\
1:54\
sin, make it difficult for us to\
perceive God's love for us.\
2:00\
Similarly, our sense of God's love may\
be blunted by challenging circumstances\
2:06\
and physical or mental illness, among\
other things.\
2:10\
In all these cases, the counsel of\
trusted leaders or professionals\
2:15\
can be beneficial.\
2:18\
We can also try to improve our\
receptivity to God's love by asking\
2:22\
ourselves, "Is my love for God constant?\
2:27\
Or do I love him when I have good days,\
but not so much when I have bad\
2:32\
days?" The second truth is that we have\
heavenly parents, a Father and\
2:39\
a Mother.\
2:41\
The doctrine of a Heavenly Mother comes\
by revelation and is a distinctive\
2:46\
belief among Latter-day Saints.\
2:49\
President Dallin H.\
2:50\
Oaks explained the importance of this\
truth.\
2:54\
Our theology begins with heavenly\
parents.\
2:58\
Our highest aspiration is to be like\
Them.\
3:02\
Very little has been revealed about\
Mother in Heaven.\
3:06\
But what we do know is summarized in a\
Gospel Topic found in our Gospel\
3:10\
Library application.\
3:13\
Once you've read what's there, you'll\
know everything that I know about\
3:17\
the subject.\
3:19\
I wish I knew more.\
3:21\
You, too, may still have questions and\
want to find more answers.\
3:27\
Seeking greater understanding\
3:29\
is an important part of our\
spiritual development.\
3:33\
But please be cautious.\
3:35\
Reason cannot replace revelation.\
3:40\
Speculation won't lead to greater\
spiritual knowledge, but it can lead us\
3:45\
to deception or divert us and divert our\
focus from what has been revealed.\
3:52\
For example, the Savior taught His\
disciples, "Always pray unto\
3:58\
the Father in my name.”\
4:00\
We follow this pattern and\
direct our worship to our\
4:03\
Heavenly Father in the\
name of Jesus Christ,\
4:06\
and do not pray to Heavenly Mother.\
4:11\
Ever since God appointed prophets,\
they've been authorized to\
4:14\
speak on His behalf, but they don't\
pronounce doctrines fabricated of their\
4:19\
own mind or teach what hasn't been\
revealed.\
4:23\
Consider the words of the Old Testament\
prophet Balaam, who was offered\
4:27\
a bribe to coerce the Israelites to\
benefit Moab, Balaam said, "If\
4:34\
the King of Moab would give me his house\
full of silver and gold,\
4:39\
I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord,\
my God, to do less or more.\
4:46\
Latter-day prophets are similarly\
constrained.\
4:50\
Demanding revelation from God is both\
arrogant and unproductive.\
4:56\
Instead, we wait on the Lord and His\
timetable to reveal His truths through\
5:03\
the means that He has established.\
5:07\
The third truth in the opening paragraph\
of the Young Women Theme is\
5:10\
that we have a divine nature.\
5:13\
This is intrinsic to who we are.\
5:16\
It's spiritually genetic, inherited from\
our heavenly parents,\
5:20\
and requires no effort on our part.\
5:24\
This is our most important identity,\
regardless of how else we\
5:29\
choose to identify ourselves.\
5:32\
Understanding this profound truth is\
important for everyone, but especially\
5:37\
for individuals belonging to groups\
who've been historically\
5:41\
marginalized, oppressed, or subjugated.\
5:46\
Remember that your most important\
identity relates to your divine nature\
5:51\
as a child of God.\
5:55\
The fourth truth is that we have an\
eternal destiny.\
5:59\
Such a destiny will not be forced on us.\
6:03\
After death, we will receive what we've\
qualified for and enjoy only that which\
6:09\
we're willing to receive.\
6:12\
Realizing our eternal destiny is\
dependent on our choices.\
6:17\
It requires making and keeping sacred\
covenants.\
6:21\
This covenant path is the way we come\
unto Christ and is based on absolute\
6:26\
truth and eternal, unchanging law.\
6:30\
We cannot create our own path and expect\
God's promised outcomes.\
6:36\
To expect His blessings while not\
following the eternal laws upon which\
6:40\
they're predicated is misguided, like\
thinking we can touch\
6:45\
a hot stove and decide not to be burned.\
6:51\
You may know that I used to treat\
patients with heart failure.\
6:55\
Their best outcomes were obtained by\
following established, evidence-based\
6:59\
treatment plans.\
7:01\
Despite knowing this, some patients\
tried to negotiate a different\
7:06\
treatment plan.\
7:07\
They said, "I don't want to take so many\
medications," or "I don't want\
7:13\
to undergo so many follow-up tests." Of\
course, patients were free to make\
7:19\
their own decisions, but if they\
deviated from the optimal treatment\
7:24\
plans, their results suffered.\
7:29\
Patients with heart failure cannot\
choose an inferior course and blame\
7:33\
their cardiologists for inferior\
outcomes.\
7:37\
The same is true for us.\
7:39\
Heavenly Father's prescribed path leads\
to the best eternal outcomes.\
7:44\
We are free to choose, but we cannot\
choose the consequences of not\
7:49\
following the revealed path.\
7:52\
The Lord has said that which breaketh\
the law and abideth not by\
7:57\
law, but seeketh to become a law unto\
itself, cannot be sanctified by\
8:03\
law, neither by mercy, justice nor\
judgment.\
8:08\
We cannot deviate from Heavenly Father's\
course and then blame Him\
8:14\
for inferior outcomes.\
8:17\
The second paragraph in the Young Women\
Theme reads, "As a disciple of Jesus\
8:22\
Christ, I strive to become like Him.\
8:26\
I seek and act upon personal revelation\
and minister to others in His holy\
8:31\
name." We can develop a testimony of\
Jesus Christ by acting in faith.\
8:38\
We can claim the spiritual gift to know\
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God\
8:42\
and that He was crucified for the sins\
of the world.\
8:47\
Or we can receive the gift to believe on\
the words of those who do know until\
8:51\
we know for ourselves.\
8:53\
We can follow the Savior's teachings and\
help others come unto Him.\
8:58\
In this way, we join Him in His work.\
9:02\
The Young Women Theme continues.\
9:05\
"I will stand as a witness of God at all\
times, and in all things, and in\
9:09\
all places." All members of the Church\
are needed as witnesses of\
9:15\
God, although Apostles and Seventies are\
commissioned as special witnesses\
9:20\
of the name of Christ.\
9:23\
Imagine a soccer match in which only the\
goalie protects the goal.\
9:30\
Without the help of the other team\
players, the goalie won't be able to\
9:34\
adequately defend the goal, and the team\
will always lose.\
9:40\
So, too, everyone is needed on the\
Lord's team.\
9:47\
The final paragraph of the Young Women\
Theme begins, "As I strive to qualify\
9:52\
for exaltation, I cherish the gift of\
repentance and seek to improve each\
9:57\
day." Because of the Savior's atoning\
sacrifice, we can repent, learn from\
10:05\
our mistakes, and not be condemned by\
them.\
10:09\
President Russell M. Nelson taught,\
10:12\
“Too many people consider\
repentance as punishment.\
10:16\
But this feeling of being penalized is\
engendered by Satan.\
10:21\
He tries to block us from looking to\
Jesus Christ, who stands with open\
10:26\
arms, hoping and willing to heal,\
forgive, cleanse,\
10:34\
strengthen, purify, and sanctify us."\
When we sincerely repent, no spiritual\
10:44\
scar remains, no matter what we've done,\
how serious it was, or how many\
10:50\
times we repeated it.\
10:53\
As often as we repent and seek\
forgiveness with real intent,\
10:57\
we can be forgiven.\
11:00\
What a remarkable gift from our Savior,\
Jesus Christ.\
11:06\
The Holy Ghost can assure us that we've\
been forgiven.\
11:10\
As we sense joy and peace, guilt is\
swept away, and we're no longer\
11:15\
tormented by our sin.\
11:19\
Even after sincere repentance, however,\
we may stumble.\
11:24\
Stumbling doesn't mean that the\
repentance was inadequate but may\
11:28\
simply reflect human weakness.\
11:32\
How comforting to know that the Lord\
sees weaknesses differently than He\
11:36\
sees rebellion.\
11:38\
We shouldn't doubt the Savior's ability\
to help us with our\
11:41\
weaknesses, because when the Lord speaks\
of weaknesses, it is always with mercy.\
11:50\
The Young Woman Theme concludes, "With\
faith, I will\
11:54\
strengthen my home and family, make and\
keep sacred covenants, [and]\
11:59\
receive the ordinances and blessings of\
the holy temple."\
12:04\
Strengthening home and family may mean\
forging the first link in a chain of\
12:10\
faithfulness, carrying on a legacy of\
faith or restoring it.\
12:17\
Regardless, strength comes through faith\
in Jesus Christ and by making\
12:23\
sacred covenants.\
12:25\
In the temple, we learn who we are and\
where we have been.\
12:31\
The Roman philosopher Cicero said, "To\
be ignorant of what occurred\
12:36\
before you were born is to remain always\
as a child."\
12:42\
He was, of course, referring to secular\
history.\
12:46\
But his astute observation can be\
expanded.\
12:50\
We live as perpetual children if we're\
ignorant of the eternal perspective\
12:55\
gained in temples.\
12:58\
There, we grow up in the Lord, receive a\
fullness of the Holy Ghost,\
13:03\
and become more fully committed as\
disciples of the Savior.\
13:08\
As we keep our covenants, we receive\
God's power in our lives.\
13:15\
I invite you to center your life on\
Jesus Christ and remember\
13:20\
the foundational truths in the Young\
Women Theme.\
13:24\
If you are willing, the Holy Ghost will\
guide you.\
13:29\
Our Heavenly Father wants you to become\
His heir and receive all that He has.\
13:37\
He cannot offer you more.\
13:40\
He cannot promise you more.\
13:43\
He loves you more than you know and\
wants you to be happy in this life\
13:48\
and in the life to come.\
13:50\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
