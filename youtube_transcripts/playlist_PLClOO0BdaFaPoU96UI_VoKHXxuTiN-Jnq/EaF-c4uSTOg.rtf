My dear brothers and sisters, welcome to\
general conference.\
0:08\
I look forward to this day with great\
anticipation.\
0:13\
I pray for you every day.\
0:16\
I've also prayed that this conference\
will be a time of spiritual\
0:19\
rejuvenation for each one of you.\
0:24\
Since last conference, difficulties in\
the world have continued.\
0:29\
The global pandemic still affects our\
lives, and now the world has been\
0:36\
rocked by a conflict that is raining\
terror on millions of innocent\
0:40\
men, women, and children.\
0:44\
Prophets have foreseen our day when\
there would be wars and rumors of\
0:49\
wars, and when the whole earth would be\
in commotion.\
0:54\
As followers of Jesus Christ, we plead\
with leaders of nations to find\
1:01\
peaceful resolutions to their\
differences.\
1:05\
We call upon people everywhere to pray\
for those in need,\
1:10\
to do what they can\
to help the distressed,\
1:13\
and to seek the Lordâ€™s help in\
ending any major conflicts.\
1:22\
Brothers and sisters, the gospel of\
Jesus Christ has never been needed more\
1:26\
than it is today.\
1:28\
Contention violates everything the\
Savior stood for and taught.\
1:36\
I love the Lord Jesus Christ and testify\
that His Gospel is\
1:40\
the only enduring solution for peace.\
1:46\
His gospel is a gospel of peace.\
1:50\
His gospel is the only answer when many\
in the world are stunned with fear.\
2:00\
This underscores the urgent need for us\
to follow the Lord's\
2:03\
instructions to His disciples to\
"go...into all the world, and preach\
2:08\
the gospel to every creature." We have\
the sacred responsibility to share\
2:16\
the power and peace of Jesus Christ with\
all who will listen and who will\
2:22\
let God prevail in their lives.\
2:26\
Every person who has made covenants with\
God has promised to care about\
2:32\
others and serve those in need.\
2:37\
We can demonstrate faith in God and\
always be ready to respond to those\
2:41\
who ask about the hope that is in us.\
2:45\
Each of us has a role to play in the\
gathering of Israel.\
2:53\
Today, I reaffirm strongly that the Lord\
has asked every\
2:59\
worthy, able young man to prepare for\
and serve a mission.\
3:08\
For Latter-day Saint young men,\
missionary service is\
3:11\
a priesthood responsibility.\
3:14\
You young men have been reserved for\
this time when the promised\
3:18\
gathering of Israel is taking place.\
3:21\
As you serve missions,\
you play a pivotal role in this\
3:24\
unprecedented event.\
3:29\
For you, young and able sisters, a\
mission is also a\
3:34\
powerful, but optional, opportunity.\
3:40\
We love sister missionaries and welcome\
them wholeheartedly.\
3:46\
What they contribute in this work is\
magnificent.\
3:50\
Pray to know if the Lord would have you\
serve a mission, and the Holy Ghost\
3:55\
will respond to your heart and mind.\
3:58\
Dear young friends, you are each vital\
to the Lord.\
4:04\
He has held you in reserve until now to\
help gather Israel.\
4:11\
Your decision to serve a mission,\
whether a proselyting or\
4:16\
a service mission, will bless you and\
many others.\
4:24\
We also welcome senior couples to serve\
when their circumstances permit.\
4:29\
Their efforts are simply irreplaceable.\
4:34\
All missionaries teach and testify of\
the Savior.\
4:38\
The spiritual darkness in the world\
makes the light of Jesus Christ needed\
4:43\
more than ever.\
4:45\
Everyone deserves the chance to\
know about the restored gospel\
4:49\
of Jesus Christ.\
4:51\
Every person deserves to know where they\
can find the hope and peace "that\
4:56\
[passes] all understanding."\
5:02\
May this conference be a time of peace\
and spiritual feasting for you.\
5:08\
May you seek and receive personal\
revelation during these sessions,\
5:14\
I pray in the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
