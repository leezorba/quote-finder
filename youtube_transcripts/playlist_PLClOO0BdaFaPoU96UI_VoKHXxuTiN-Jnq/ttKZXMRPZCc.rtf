Speaking to Thomas B. Marsh,\
0:03\
a recent convert, the Lord said\
encouragingly, “Lift up your heart\
0:09\
and rejoice, for the hour of your\
mission is come." I believe this\
0:15\
invitation can serve as an inspiration\
for all members of the Church.\
0:20\
After all, we have each received from\
our Heavenly Father the mission of\
0:24\
gathering Israel on both sides of the\
veil.\
0:29\
That gathering, President Russell M.\
0:31\
Nelson has said, is the "most important\
thing taking place on earth today."\
0:37\
Nothing else compares in magnitude.\
0:40\
Nothing else compares in importance.\
0:42\
Nothing else compares in majesty.\
0:46\
Certainly there are many worthy causes\
in the world.\
0:50\
It is impossible to name them all.\
0:53\
But wouldn't you like to participate in\
a great cause within your reach\
0:59\
and where your contribution makes a\
vital difference?\
1:04\
The gathering makes an eternal\
difference to all.\
1:09\
People of all ages can participate in\
this cause regardless of their\
1:14\
circumstances and where they live.\
1:17\
There is no other cause in the world\
more inclusive.\
1:22\
Speaking specifically to the youth,\
President Nelson said that "our\
1:27\
Heavenly Father has reserved many\
of His most noble spirits - perhaps...\
1:34\
His finest team - for this final phase.\
1:39\
Those noble spirits-those finest\
players, those heroes-are you!"\
1:46\
Yes, you have been prepared from before\
this life and born now to participate\
1:53\
in the great work of the gathering of\
Israel on both sides of the veil in\
1:58\
these latter days.\
2:00\
And why is this cause so important?\
2:05\
Because the "worth of souls is great in\
the sight of God," and because "whoso\
2:11\
believeth in [Jesus Christ], and is\
baptized, the same shall be saved...\
2:18\
and shall inherit the kingdom of God."\
Furthermore, "all that [the] Father\
2:24\
hath shall be given unto [those who\
receive his ordinances and keep his\
2:30\
covenants]." In addition, the laborers\
are few.\
2:36\
Only in The Church of Jesus Christ of\
Latter- day Saints do we find\
2:40\
the power, the authority, and the way to\
offer such a blessing to\
2:45\
others, whether living or dead.\
2:50\
As President Nelson said, "Anytime you\
do anything that helps anyone-on either\
2:56\
side of the veil-take a step toward\
making covenants with God\
3:01\
and receiving their essential baptismal\
and temple ordinances, you are helping\
3:07\
to gather Israel.\
3:09\
It is as simple as that." While there\
are many ways to help in\
3:15\
the gathering, I would like to speak of\
one in particular-serving as\
3:20\
a full-time missionary.\
3:23\
For many of you, this will mean being a\
teaching missionary.\
3:27\
For many others, it will mean being a\
service missionary.\
3:33\
But the world tries to distract youth\
from this most sacred responsibility\
3:39\
using fear and insecurities.\
3:42\
Some distractions might be\
experiencing a pandemic,\
3:47\
leaving a good job,\
3:49\
putting off education, \
or being particularly\
3:52\
interested in someone romantically.\
3:55\
Everyone will have his or her own set of\
challenges.\
4:02\
Such distractions can arise at precisely\
the time of embarking in\
4:06\
the service of the Lord.\
4:08\
And choices that seem obvious later are\
not always as easy in the moment.\
4:14\
I know from experience the troubled mind\
of such a young person.\
4:19\
When I was preparing to go on my\
mission, some surprising forces tried\
4:23\
to discourage me.\
4:25\
One was my dentist.\
4:29\
When he realized my appointment was so I\
could be a missionary, he tried to\
4:35\
dissuade me from serving.\
4:37\
I had not had the least notion that my\
dentist was against the Church.\
4:43\
The interruption of my education was\
also complicated.\
4:47\
When I asked for a two-year leave of\
absence from my university\
4:51\
program, I was informed that it was not\
possible.\
4:55\
I would lose my place at the university\
if I did not return\
4:59\
after one year.\
5:01\
In Brazil, this was serious since the\
only criteria for admittance in\
5:08\
a university program was a very\
difficult and competitive examination.\
5:15\
After repeatedly insisting, I was\
reluctantly informed that after being\
5:20\
absent for one year, I could apply for\
an exception on extraordinary grounds.\
5:27\
It might be approved or not.\
5:30\
I was terrified at the idea of retaking\
that difficult admissions test after\
5:37\
two years away from my studies.\
5:41\
I also was especially interested in a\
young woman.\
5:45\
Several of my friends shared that same\
interest.\
5:51\
I thought to myself, "If I go on a\
mission, I'm running a risk." But\
5:57\
the Lord Jesus Christ was my great\
inspiration not to be afraid of\
6:01\
the future as I strove to serve Him with\
all my heart.\
6:05\
He also had a mission to fulfill.\
6:08\
In His own words, He explained, "For I\
came down from\
6:12\
heaven, not to do mine own will, but the\
will of him that sent\
6:15\
me." And was His mission easy?\
6:18\
Of course not.\
6:20\
His suffering, which was an essential\
part of His mission, "caused\
6:23\
[Him], even God, the greatest of all, to\
tremble because of\
6:28\
pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to\
suffer both body\
6:32\
and spirit-and would that [He] might not\
drink the bitter cup, and shrink-\
6:38\
nevertheless, glory be\
to the Father. ...\
6:42\
[He] partook and finished [His]\
preparations unto the children of men."\
6:47\
Serving a full-time mission may seem\
difficult to us.\
6:50\
Perhaps it requires that we give up\
important things for a moment.\
6:55\
The Lord certainly knows this, and He\
will always be by our side.\
7:00\
In fact, in their message to\
missionaries in Preach My\
7:04\
Gospel, the First Presidency promises,\
"The Lord will reward\
7:10\
and richly bless you as you humbly and\
prayerfully serve Him." It is true\
7:16\
that all the children of God are blessed\
in one way or another.\
7:20\
But there is a difference between being\
blessed\
7:23\
and being richly blessed in His service.\
7:27\
Remember the challenges that I thought I\
faced prior to my mission?\
7:31\
My dentist- I found another.\
7:33\
My university- they made an exception\
for me.\
7:37\
Remember that young woman?\
7:39\
She married one of my good friends.\
7:44\
But God truly blessed me richly, and I\
learned that\
7:49\
the blessings of the Lord can come in\
ways different from how we expect.\
7:53\
After all, His thoughts are not our\
thoughts.\
7:57\
Among the many rich blessings He has\
given me for serving Him as\
8:01\
a full-time missionary are a greater\
faith in Jesus Christ and in His\
8:06\
Atonement and a stronger knowledge and\
testimony of His teachings so that\
8:12\
I am not easily swayed by every wind of\
doctrine.\
8:17\
I lost my fear of teaching.\
8:19\
My capacity to face challenges with\
optimism increased.\
8:24\
By observing individuals and families I\
met or taught as a\
8:28\
missionary, I learned that the teachings\
of God are true when He\
8:33\
says that sin does not bring true\
happiness and that obedience to\
8:38\
the commandments of God help us prosper,\
both temporally\
8:41\
and spiritually.\
8:43\
And I learned for myself that God is a\
God of miracles.\
8:50\
All of these things were instrumental in\
my preparation for adult\
8:53\
life, including possible marriage and\
parenthood, Church\
8:58\
service, and professional and community\
life.\
9:01\
After my mission, I benefited from my\
increased courage to present myself\
9:06\
as a faithful follower of Jesus Christ\
and His Church in all circumstances\
9:10\
and to all people, even sharing the\
gospel with a beautiful woman who\
9:16\
would become my virtuous, wise, fun, and\
beloved eternal\
9:21\
companion, the sunshine of my life.\
9:26\
Yes, God has blessed me richly far\
beyond what I imagined, just as He will\
9:33\
all those who humbly and prayerfully\
serve Him.\
9:37\
I am eternally grateful to God for His\
goodness.\
9:41\
My mission completely shaped my life.\
9:43\
I learned it is worth the effort to\
trust in God, to trust in His\
9:48\
wisdom, in mercy, and in His promises.\
9:51\
After all, He is our Father, and without\
any doubt, He wants\
9:57\
the best for us.\
9:59\
Dear youth throughout the world, I\
extend the same invitation\
10:04\
that our prophet, President Nelson, has\
made to all of you to\
10:08\
enlist in the youth battalion of the\
Lord to help gather Israel.\
10:13\
President Nelson said, "There is nothing\
of greater consequence.\
10:18\
Absolutely nothing.\
10:20\
This gathering should mean everything to\
you.\
10:23\
This is the mission for which you were\
sent to earth." We were born at this\
10:28\
time for a divine purpose-the gathering\
of Israel.\
10:32\
When we serve as full-time missionaries,\
we will be challenged at times.\
10:36\
But the Lord Himself\
10:38\
is our great exemplar and guide\
in such circumstances.\
10:42\
He understands what\
a difficult mission is.\
10:46\
With His help, we can do hard things.\
10:51\
He will be by our side, and He will\
bless us greatly as we humbly serve Him.\
10:56\
For all of these reasons,\
10:58\
I am not surprised that the Lord said to\
Thomas B. Marsh and to all of us,\
11:04\
“Lift up your\
heart and rejoice, for the hour of your\
11:08\
mission is come." In the name of Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
