Imagine with me, for a moment, standing\
on a mountain in Galilee, witnessing\
0:08\
the wonder and glory of the resurrected\
Savior visiting His disciples.\
0:15\
How awe- inspiring to consider\
personally hearing these words which He\
0:18\
shared with them, His solemn charge to\
"Go ye therefore, and teach all\
0:24\
nations, baptizing them in the name of\
the Father, and of the Son, and of\
0:29\
the Holy Ghost." Surely those words\
would empower, inspire, and move each\
0:34\
of us, as it did His disciples.\
0:38\
Indeed, they devoted the rest of their\
lives to doing just that.\
0:43\
Interestingly, it wasn't only the\
Apostles who\
0:47\
took Jesus's words to\
heart.\
0:49\
Members of the early Church, from the\
newest to the most\
0:52\
seasoned, took part in the Savior's\
great commission, sharing the good news\
0:58\
of the gospel with those they met and\
knew.\
1:03\
The determination to share their\
testimony of Jesus Christ helped His\
1:08\
newly established Church grow\
expansively.\
1:13\
We, too, as Christ's disciples, are\
invited to heed His\
1:16\
commission today, as if we were there on\
that mountain in Galilee when He\
1:21\
first proclaimed it.\
1:24\
This commission began again in 1830,\
when Joseph Smith set apart his\
1:30\
brother Samuel as an early missionary of\
the Church of Jesus Christ.\
1:37\
Since that time, more than 1.5 million\
missionaries have traveled throughout\
1:43\
the world, teaching all nations and\
baptizing those who embrace\
1:47\
the glad tidings of the restored gospel.\
1:51\
This is our doctrine.\
1:54\
Our fond desire.\
1:56\
From our young children to the eldest\
among us, we yearn for the time when we\
1:59\
can heed the Savior's call and share the\
gospel with the nations of\
2:04\
the world.\
2:06\
I'm sure you young men and young women\
felt a similar empowering challenge\
2:11\
from our prophet yesterday as he invited\
you to prepare for full-time\
2:17\
missionary service, just as the Savior\
did with His Apostles.\
2:23\
Like sprinters at the starting blocks,\
we wait with anticipation\
2:27\
for the official invitation, complete\
with the prophet's signature, signaling\
2:33\
the start of the race.\
2:35\
This desire is noble and inspirational.\
2:37\
However, let's consider this question:\
Why don't we all begin now?\
2:45\
You might ask, "How can I be a\
missionary without a name badge?" Or\
2:50\
we tell ourselves:\
2:52\
â€œThe full-time missionaries\
2:53\
are set apart to do this work.\
2:56\
I'd like to help, but perhaps later when\
life has calmed down a bit."\
3:01\
Brothers and sisters, it is much simpler\
than that.\
3:05\
Gratefully, the Savior's great\
commission can be accomplished through\
3:08\
simple, easily understandable principles\
taught to each of us from\
3:13\
childhood: Love, share, and invite.\
3:21\
The first thing we can do is love as\
Christ loved.\
3:25\
Our hearts are heavy with the human\
suffering and tensions that we see\
3:30\
throughout the world during these\
tumultuous times.\
3:35\
However, we can also be inspired by the\
outpouring of compassion\
3:39\
and humanitarianism that has been\
demonstrated by people everywhere\
3:44\
through their efforts to reach out to\
the marginalized- those displaced from\
3:49\
their homes, separated from their\
families, or experiencing other forms\
3:54\
of sorrow and despair.\
3:58\
Recently, news sources reported how a\
group of mothers in Poland, out of\
4:01\
concern for fleeing, desperate families,\
left fully equipped strollers\
4:07\
on a train station platform in a neat\
line, ready and waiting for refugee\
4:13\
mothers and children who would need them\
at that border crossing as they\
4:18\
deboarded a train.\
4:21\
Surely our Heavenly Father smiles upon\
acts of selfless charity\
4:26\
as these.\
4:27\
For as we bear one another's burdens, we\
"fulfil the Law of Christ."\
4:33\
Whenever we show Christlike love towards\
our neighbor, we preach\
4:37\
the gospel, even if we do not voice a\
single word.\
4:42\
Love for others is the eloquent\
expression of the second great\
4:46\
commandment to love our neighbor.\
4:48\
It shows the refining process of the\
Holy Spirit working within our souls.\
4:53\
By demonstrating Christ's love to\
others, we may cause those who see our\
4:57\
good works to glorify our Father, which\
is in heaven.\
5:01\
We do this expecting nothing in return.\
5:06\
Of course, we hope that they will accept\
our love and our\
5:10\
message, though how they react is not\
within our control.\
5:16\
What we do and who we are certainly is.\
5:21\
Through Christlike love for others, we\
preach the glorious life-\
5:25\
transforming properties of Christ's\
gospel, and we participate\
5:30\
significantly in the fulfilling of His\
great commission.\
5:36\
The second thing we can do is share.\
5:41\
During the early months of the COVID-19\
pandemic, Brother Wisan\
5:44\
from Thailand felt prompted to share his\
feelings and impressions of what he\
5:50\
was learning in his study of the Book of\
Mormon on his social media account.\
5:56\
In one of his particularly personal\
posts, he shared a story of two Book of\
6:01\
Mormon missionaries, Alma and Almulek.\
6:05\
His brother, Winai, although set in his\
religious beliefs, was touched by\
6:09\
the post and responded unexpectedly\
asking, "Can I get that book in Thai?"\
6:17\
Wisan wisely arranged for a copy of the\
Book of Mormon to be delivered by\
6:21\
two sister missionaries who began\
teaching his brother.\
6:26\
Wisan joined in virtual lessons, during\
which he shared his\
6:31\
feelings about the Book of Mormon.\
6:34\
Winai learned to pray and study with a\
truth-seeking spirit, to accept\
6:38\
and embrace the truth.\
6:41\
Within months, Winai was baptized!\
6:45\
Wisan later said, "We have a\
responsibility to be an instrument in\
6:50\
the hands of God, and we must be always\
ready for Him to do His work in His way\
6:56\
through us." Their family miracle came\
because Wisan simply shared the gospel\
7:04\
in a normal and natural way.\
7:07\
We share all things with others.\
7:09\
We do it often.\
7:11\
We share what movies and food we like,\
funny things we see, places we\
7:15\
visit, art we appreciate, quotes we're\
inspired by.\
7:21\
How might we simply add to the list of\
things we already share what we love\
7:26\
about the Gospel of Jesus Christ?\
7:30\
Elder Dieter F.\
7:31\
Uchtdorf explained, quote: "If someone\
asks you about your weekend, don't\
7:36\
hesitate to talk about what you\
experienced at church.\
7:40\
Tell about the little children who stood\
in front of a congregation\
7:43\
and sang with eagerness how they're\
trying to be like Jesus.\
7:48\
Talk about the group of youth who spent\
time helping the elderly in rest homes\
7:53\
to compile their personal histories,"\
close quote.\
7:59\
Sharing isn't about "selling" the\
gospel.\
8:03\
You don't have to write a sermon or\
correct someone's incorrect perceptions.\
8:08\
When it comes to missionary work, God\
doesn't need you to be His\
8:12\
sheriff; He does, however, ask you to be\
His sharer.\
8:19\
By sharing our positive experiences in\
the gospel with others, we take part in\
8:24\
fulfilling the Savior's great\
commission.\
8:29\
The third thing you can do is invite.\
8:33\
Sister Mayra is a recent convert from\
Ecuador.\
8:38\
Her joy in the gospel skyrocketed\
immediately following her baptism\
8:43\
as she invited friends and loved ones\
8:46\
around her through her social media\
accounts.\
8:50\
Many family members and friends who saw\
her posts responded with questions.\
8:56\
Mayra connected with them, often\
inviting them to her home to meet with\
9:02\
the missionaries together.\
9:05\
Mayra's parents, her siblings, her aunt,\
two cousins, and several of her\
9:09\
friends were baptized because she\
courageously invited them to "come\
9:16\
and see," "come and serve," and "come\
and belong." Through her normal\
9:21\
and natural invitations, over 20 people\
have accepted her invitation to be\
9:28\
baptized members of the Church of Jesus\
Christ.\
9:33\
This came about because Mayra simply\
invited others to experience the joy\
9:39\
she felt as a member of the Church.\
9:44\
There are hundreds of invitations we can\
extend to others.\
9:47\
We can invite others to "come and see" a\
sacrament service, a ward\
9:51\
activity, an online video that explains\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
9:57\
"Come and see" can be an invitation to\
read the Book of Mormon or visit a new\
10:02\
temple during its open house prior to\
its dedication.\
10:07\
Sometimes the invitation is something we\
extend inward- an invitation to\
10:11\
ourselves, giving us awareness and\
vision of opportunities surrounding\
10:16\
us to act upon.\
10:20\
In our digital age, members often share\
messages through social media.\
10:24\
There are hundreds, if not thousands, of\
uplifting things you\
10:28\
might find worthy of sharing.\
10:32\
This content offers invitations to "come\
and see," "come and\
10:37\
serve," and "come and belong." As we\
invite others to learn more about\
10:43\
the gospel of Jesus Christ, we take part\
in the Savior's call to engage in\
10:49\
the work of His commission.\
10:54\
My beloved brothers and sisters, we have\
spoken today of three\
10:57\
simple, easy things that anyone can do.\
11:01\
Things you can do!\
11:04\
Perhaps you're already doing them-even\
without fully realizing it!\
11:09\
I invite you to consider ways that you\
can love, share, and invite.\
11:15\
As you do so, you will feel a measure of\
joy, knowing that you are heeding\
11:20\
the words of our beloved Savior.\
11:24\
What I'm urging you to do is not a new\
program.\
11:30\
You've heard these principles before.\
11:33\
This is not the "next big thing" the\
Church is asking you to do.\
11:39\
These three things are merely an\
extension of who we already are\
11:45\
as disciples of Jesus Christ.\
11:48\
No name badge or letter is required.\
11:51\
No formal calling is needed.\
11:54\
As these three things become a natural\
part of who we are and how we\
11:59\
live, they will become an automatic,\
unforced expression of\
12:05\
genuine love.\
12:07\
As those disciples of Christ who\
gathered together to learn from Him in\
12:12\
Galilee 2,000 years ago, we, too, can\
embrace the Savior's charge\
12:19\
and go into all the world preaching the\
gospel.\
12:24\
As we love, share, and invite, we take\
part in that great and glorious work\
12:30\
that prepares the earth for the return\
of its Messiah.\
12:37\
That we may heed the Savior's call and\
strive to engage in His great\
12:41\
commission is my prayer.\
12:44\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
