A few years ago at a family gathering,\
my then eight-year-old\
0:06\
nephew, William, asked our oldest son,\
Briton, if he would play ball with him.\
0:11\
Briton enthusiastically responded, "Yes!\
0:14\
I would love to!" After they had been\
playing for quite some time, a ball got\
0:19\
away from Briton, and he accidentally\
broke one of his\
0:22\
grandparents' antique\
pots.\
0:25\
Briton felt awful.\
0:27\
As he began picking up the broken\
pieces, William walked over to his\
0:32\
cousin and lovingly patted him on the\
back.\
0:35\
He then comforted, "Don't worry, Briton.\
0:38\
I broke something at Grandma and\
Grandpa's house once and Grandma\
0:42\
put her arm around me and said, 'It's\
okay, William, you are only\
0:47\
five.'" To which Briton responded, "But\
William, I'm 23!"\
0:55\
We can learn much from the scriptures\
about how our Savior, Jesus\
0:59\
Christ, will help us successfully\
navigate the things in our lives that\
1:04\
are broken, no matter our age.\
1:07\
He can heal broken relationships with\
God, broken relationships with\
1:12\
others, and broken parts of ourselves.\
1:16\
While the Savior was teaching in the\
temple, a woman was brought to him\
1:19\
by the scribes and Pharisees.\
1:21\
We do not know her full story, just that\
she was "taken in adultery." Often\
1:27\
the scriptures give only a small portion\
of someone's life, and based\
1:31\
on that portion, we sometimes tend to\
exalt or condemn.\
1:36\
No one's life can be understood by one\
magnificent moment or one regrettable\
1:41\
public disappointment.\
1:43\
The purpose of these scriptural accounts\
is to help us see that Jesus\
1:48\
Christ was the answer then, and He is\
the answer now.\
1:53\
He knows our complete story and exactly\
what we suffer, as well\
1:58\
as our capabilities and vulnerabilities.\
2:01\
Christ's response to this precious\
daughter of God was, "Neither do\
2:05\
I condemn thee; go and sin no more."\
Another way to say "go and sin no more"\
2:13\
could be "go forth and change." The\
Savior was inviting her to\
2:18\
repent, to change her behavior, her\
associations, the way she\
2:23\
felt about herself, her heart.\
2:26\
Because of Christ, our decision to "go\
forth and change" can also allow us to\
2:32\
"go forth and heal." For He is the\
source of healing all that is\
2:37\
broken in our lives.\
2:39\
As the great Mediator and Advocate with\
the Father, Christ sanctifies\
2:44\
and restores broken relationships- most\
importantly our relationship with God.\
2:50\
The Joseph Smith Translation makes it\
clear that the woman did follow\
2:54\
the Savior's counsel and changed her\
life: "And the woman glorified God from\
2:59\
that hour and believed on his name." It\
is unfortunate we do not know her name\
3:05\
or other details about her life after\
this moment because it would have\
3:10\
required great determination, humility,\
and faith in Jesus Christ\
3:16\
for her to repent and change.\
3:18\
What we do know is she was a woman who\
believed on His name with\
3:23\
the understanding that she was not\
beyond the reach of His infinite\
3:28\
and eternal sacrifice.\
3:31\
In Luke Chapter 15, we read a parable of\
a man who had two sons.\
3:36\
The younger son asked his father for his\
inheritance, took his journey\
3:40\
into a far country, and wasted his\
substance with riotous living.\
3:45\
"And when he had spent all, there arose\
a mighty famine in that land; And he\
3:49\
began to be in want.\
3:52\
And he went and joined himself to a\
citizen of that country; and he sent\
3:56\
him into his fields to feed swine.\
3:58\
And he would fain have filled his belly\
with the husks that the swine did\
4:03\
eat; and no man gave unto him.\
4:06\
And when he came to himself, he said,\
How many hired servants of my\
4:11\
father's have bread enough and to spare,\
and I perish with hunger!\
4:17\
I will arise and go to my father, and\
will say unto him,\
4:21\
Father, I have sinned against Heaven,\
and before thee, And I'm no\
4:25\
more worthy to be called thy son; make\
me as one of thy hired servants.\
4:31\
And he arose, and came to his father.\
4:34\
But when he was yet a great way off, his\
father saw him, and had\
4:39\
compassion, and ran, and fell on his\
neck, and kissed him." The fact that\
4:45\
the father ran to his son, I believe, is\
significant.\
4:50\
The personal hurt that the son had\
inflicted upon his father was surely\
4:54\
deep and profound.\
4:55\
Likewise, the father may have been\
genuinely\
4:58\
embarrassed by his son's\
actions.\
5:00\
So, why didn't the father wait for his\
son to apologize?\
5:05\
Why didn't he hold out for an offering\
of restitution and reconciliation\
5:10\
before extending forgiveness and love?\
5:14\
This is something I have often pondered.\
5:17\
The Lord teaches us that forgiving\
others is a universal\
5:21\
commandment: "I, the Lord, will forgive\
whom I will forgive.\
5:25\
But of you it is required to forgive all\
men." Extending forgiveness\
5:31\
and love can take tremendous courage and\
humility.\
5:36\
It can also take time.\
5:39\
It requires us to put our faith and\
trust in the Lord as we assume\
5:43\
accountability for the condition of our\
hearts.\
5:48\
Here lies the significance and power of\
our agency.\
5:53\
With the depiction of this father in the\
parable of the prodigal\
5:56\
son, the Savior emphasized that\
forgiveness is one of the noblest gifts\
6:01\
we can give one another, and most\
specifically, ourselves.\
6:07\
Unburdening our hearts through\
forgiveness isn't always easy,\
6:11\
but through the enabling power of Jesus\
Christ, it is possible.\
6:17\
In Acts chapter 3, we learn about a man\
who was born lame and "whom they\
6:20\
laid daily at the gate of the temple\
which is called Beautiful, to ask alms\
6:26\
of them that entered into the temple."\
The lame beggar was over 40 years old\
6:32\
and had spent his entire life in a\
seemingly never-ending state of\
6:37\
wanting and waiting, for he was\
dependent on the generosity of others.\
6:44\
One day he saw "Peter and John about to\
go into the temple [and] asked\
6:48\
an alms.\
6:50\
And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him\
with John, said, Look on us.\
6:55\
And he gave heed unto them, expecting to\
receive something of them.\
6:59\
Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I\
none, but such as I have give\
7:05\
I thee: in the name of Jesus Christ of\
Nazareth rise up and walk.\
7:13\
And he took him by the hand, and lifted\
him up: and immediately his\
7:18\
feet and ankle bones received strength.\
7:21\
And he leaping up stood, and walked, and\
entered with them into\
7:25\
the temple, walking and leaping and\
praising God." Oftentimes we can\
7:33\
find ourselves like the lame beggar at\
the gate of the temple, patiently-or\
7:39\
sometimes impatiently-"waiting upon the\
Lord." Waiting to be healed\
7:45\
physically or emotionally.\
7:47\
Waiting for answers that penetrate the\
deepest part of our hearts.\
7:53\
Waiting for a miracle.\
7:56\
Waiting upon the Lord can be a sacred\
place, a place of polishing\
8:01\
and refining where we can come to know\
the Savior in a deeply personal way.\
8:08\
Waiting upon the Lord may also be a\
place where we find ourselves\
8:13\
asking, "Oh, God, where art thou?" A\
place where spiritual perseverance\
8:21\
requires us to exercise faith in Christ\
by intentionally choosing Him again\
8:29\
and again and again.\
8:33\
I know this place and I understand this\
type of waiting.\
8:39\
I spent countless hours at a cancer\
treatment facility, united in my\
8:43\
suffering with many who were yearning to\
be healed.\
8:48\
Some lived; others did not.\
8:52\
I learned in a profound way that\
deliverance from our trials is\
8:56\
different for each of us, and therefore\
our focus should be less\
9:00\
about the way in which we are delivered\
and more about the Deliverer Himself.\
9:07\
Our emphasis should always be on Jesus\
Christ.\
9:11\
Exercising faith in Christ means\
trusting not only in God's\
9:15\
will, but also in His timing, for He\
knows exactly what we need\
9:21\
and precisely when we need it.\
9:23\
When we submit to the will of the Lord,\
we will ultimately receive\
9:27\
substantially more than that which we\
had desired.\
9:31\
My dear friends, we all have something\
in our lives that is broken, that needs\
9:36\
to be mended, fixed, or healed as we\
turn to the Savior, as we align our\
9:42\
hearts and minds with Him, as we repent,\
He comes to us with "healing in\
9:49\
his wings," puts His arms lovingly\
around us and says, "It's okay.\
9:55\
You are only 5, or 16, 23, 48, 64, 91.\
10:03\
We can fix this together." I testify\
that there is nothing in your life that\
10:10\
is broken that is beyond the curative,\
redeeming, and enabling power\
10:15\
of Jesus Christ.\
10:16\
In the sacred and holy name of He who is\
mighty to heal, Jesus\
10:22\
Christ, amen.\
