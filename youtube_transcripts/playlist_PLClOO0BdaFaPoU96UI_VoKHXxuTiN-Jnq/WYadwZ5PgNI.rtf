my wife susan our three sons and their\
0:04\
wives\
0:05\
all of our grandchildren\
0:07\
and elder quentin l cook my seat mate in\
0:10\
the quorum of the twelve\
0:12\
for almost 15 years\
0:14\
all readily will attest to the fact that\
0:17\
i do not sing well\
0:22\
but in spite of my lack of vocal talent\
0:24\
i love to sing the hymns of the\
0:26\
restoration\
0:28\
the combination of inspired lyrics and\
0:31\
majestic melodies\
0:33\
helps me to learn essential gospel\
0:35\
principles and stirs my soul\
0:40\
one hymn that has blessed my life in\
0:42\
remarkable ways is let us all press on\
0:46\
recently i have been pondering and\
0:48\
learning about a specific phrase in the\
0:50\
refrain of that hymn\
0:53\
we will heed not\
0:56\
what the wicked may say but the lord\
0:59\
alone we will obey\
1:02\
we will heed\
1:04\
not\
1:06\
as i sing let us all press on i often\
1:08\
think of the people in lehi's vision\
1:11\
pressing forward on the path that led to\
1:14\
the tree of life\
1:15\
who were not merely clinging to\
1:19\
but were continually holding fast to the\
1:22\
rod of iron\
1:23\
until they came forth and fell down and\
1:26\
partook of the fruit of the tree\
1:30\
lehi described multitudes in the great\
1:32\
and spacious building\
1:34\
that were pointing the finger of scorn\
1:36\
at him\
1:37\
and those partaking of the fruit\
1:41\
his response to the jeers and insults is\
1:44\
magnificent\
1:46\
and memorable\
1:48\
but we heeded them not\
1:52\
i pray that the holy ghost will bless\
1:54\
and enlighten each of us\
1:55\
as we consider together how we can be\
1:58\
strengthened to heed not\
2:00\
the evil influences and mocking voices\
2:04\
of the contemporary world in which we\
2:06\
live\
2:08\
the word heed suggests taking notice of\
2:11\
or paying attention to someone or\
2:14\
something\
2:16\
thus the lyrics of the hymn let us all\
2:18\
press on\
2:20\
admonish us to make an affirmative\
2:22\
decision to pay no attention to what the\
2:24\
wicked may say\
2:27\
and lehi and the people who were with\
2:29\
him\
2:30\
who were partaking of the fruit of the\
2:31\
tree\
2:32\
provide a strong example of not paying\
2:34\
attention to the mocking and scorn\
2:37\
that so frequently come from the great\
2:39\
and spacious building\
2:43\
the doctrine of christ written with the\
2:45\
spirit of the living god in fleshy\
2:47\
tables of our hearts\
2:49\
increases our capacity to heed not\
2:53\
the many distractions taunts and\
2:55\
diversions in our fallen world\
2:57\
for example\
2:59\
faith focused in and on the lord jesus\
3:02\
christ fortifies us with spiritual\
3:06\
strength\
3:08\
faith in the redeemer is a principle of\
3:10\
action and of power\
3:12\
as we act in accordance with the truths\
3:15\
of his gospel\
3:17\
we are blessed with the spiritual\
3:18\
capacity to press forward through the\
3:21\
challenges of mortality\
3:23\
while focusing on the joys the savior\
3:26\
offers to us\
3:28\
truly\
3:30\
if we do what's right\
3:32\
we have no need to fear\
3:35\
for the lord our helper\
3:37\
will ever be near\
3:41\
entering into sacred covenants and\
3:43\
worthily receiving priesthood ordinances\
3:46\
yokes us with and binds us to\
3:49\
the lord jesus christ and heavenly\
3:51\
father\
3:53\
this simply means that we trust in the\
3:55\
savior as our advocate and mediator\
3:59\
and rely on his merits mercy and grace\
4:02\
during the journey of life\
4:05\
as we are steadfast in coming unto\
4:07\
christ and are yoked with him\
4:10\
we receive the cleansing healing and\
4:13\
strengthening blessings of his infinite\
4:16\
and eternal atonement\
4:19\
living\
4:20\
and loving\
4:21\
covenant commitments\
4:23\
creates a connection with the lord that\
4:25\
is deeply personal and spiritually\
4:28\
powerful\
4:31\
as we honor the conditions of sacred\
4:33\
covenants and ordinances\
4:35\
we gradually and incrementally are drawn\
4:38\
closer to him\
4:40\
and experience the impact of his\
4:42\
divinity and living reality in our lives\
4:47\
jesus then becomes much more\
4:50\
than the central character in scripture\
4:52\
stories\
4:53\
his example and teachings influence our\
4:56\
every desire thought and action\
5:02\
i frankly do not have the ability to\
5:04\
describe adequately\
5:06\
the precise nature and power of our\
5:08\
covenant connection\
5:10\
with the resurrected\
5:12\
and living son of god\
5:15\
but i witness that the connections with\
5:17\
him and heavenly father are real\
5:20\
and are the ultimate sources of\
5:22\
assurance peace joy\
5:26\
and the spiritual strength that enable\
5:28\
us to fear not though the enemy deride\
5:34\
as covenant making and covenant keeping\
5:36\
disciples of jesus christ\
5:38\
we can be blessed\
5:40\
to take courage\
5:42\
for the lord is on our side\
5:45\
and pay no attention to evil influences\
5:48\
and secular scoffing\
5:52\
as i visit with members of the church\
5:54\
around the world i often ask them this\
5:57\
question\
5:58\
what helps you\
6:00\
to heed not\
6:01\
worldly influences mocking and scorn and\
6:06\
their answers are most instructive\
6:09\
valiant members often highlight the\
6:11\
importance of inviting the power of the\
6:13\
holy ghost into their lives\
6:16\
through meaningful scripture study\
6:18\
fervent prayer and proper preparation to\
6:21\
participate in the ordinance of the\
6:23\
sacrament\
6:24\
also mentioned frequently are the\
6:26\
spiritual support of faithful family\
6:28\
members and trusted friends\
6:31\
the vital lessons learned through\
6:33\
ministering and serving in the lord's\
6:35\
restored church\
6:37\
and the capacity to discern the absolute\
6:41\
emptiness of anything in\
6:44\
or coming from\
6:45\
the great and spacious building\
6:49\
i have noted in these member responses a\
6:51\
particular pattern that is especially\
6:53\
significant\
6:55\
first and foremost\
6:58\
these disciples have firm testimonies of\
7:00\
heavenly father's plan of happiness\
7:03\
and the role of jesus christ as our\
7:06\
redeemer and savior\
7:08\
and secondly\
7:10\
their spiritual knowledge and conviction\
7:12\
are individual\
7:14\
personal\
7:15\
and specific\
7:17\
they are not general and abstract\
7:21\
i listen to these devoted souls speak of\
7:24\
covenants providing strength to overcome\
7:26\
opposition\
7:28\
and their connection with the living\
7:31\
lord\
7:32\
supporting them through times both good\
7:34\
and bad\
7:36\
to these individuals\
7:40\
jesus christ indeed\
7:42\
is a personal\
7:44\
savior\
7:47\
gospel covenants and ordinances operate\
7:50\
in our lives much like a compass\
7:53\
a compass is a device used to indicate\
7:55\
the cardinal directions of north south\
7:59\
east and west\
8:00\
for purposes of navigation\
8:03\
and geographic orientation\
8:06\
in a similar way\
8:08\
our covenants and ordinances point us to\
8:11\
and help us always remember our\
8:14\
connection\
8:15\
with the lord jesus christ\
8:17\
as we progress along the covenant path\
8:22\
the cardinal direction for all of us in\
8:24\
mortality\
8:25\
is to come unto and be perfected in\
8:28\
christ\
8:30\
holy covenants and ordinances help us to\
8:32\
keep our focus upon the savior\
8:35\
and strive with his grace\
8:38\
to become more like him\
8:41\
most assuredly\
8:43\
an unseen power will aid me in you\
8:47\
in the glorious cause of truth\
8:51\
our covenant connection with god and\
8:53\
jesus christ is the channel through\
8:56\
which\
8:57\
we can receive the capacity and strength\
8:59\
to heed not\
9:02\
and this bond is strengthened as we\
9:04\
continually hold fast to the rod of iron\
9:08\
but as nephi's brethren asked what\
9:11\
meaneth the rod of iron which our father\
9:13\
saw\
9:15\
and nephi said unto them that it was the\
9:17\
word of god\
9:19\
and whoso would hearken unto the word of\
9:21\
god\
9:23\
and who would hold fast unto it\
9:26\
they would never perish\
9:28\
neither could the temptations and the\
9:30\
fiery darts of the adversary overpower\
9:33\
them unto blindness\
9:35\
to lead them away to destruction\
9:38\
please note that the ability to resist\
9:41\
the temptations\
9:43\
and the fiery darts of the adversary is\
9:45\
promised to those individuals\
9:48\
who hold fast to\
9:51\
rather than merely cling to\
9:53\
the word of god\
9:56\
interestingly the apostle john described\
9:58\
jesus christ as the word\
10:02\
in the beginning was the word\
10:04\
and the word was with god\
10:07\
and the word was god\
10:09\
all things were made by him\
10:12\
and without him was not anything made\
10:14\
that was made\
10:16\
and the word was made flesh\
10:18\
and dwelt among us\
10:20\
and we beheld his glory\
10:22\
the glory as of the only begotten of the\
10:24\
father\
10:25\
full of grace and truth\
10:28\
therefore\
10:30\
one of the names of jesus christ\
10:32\
is the word\
10:34\
in addition the eighth article of faith\
10:37\
states\
10:38\
we believe the bible to be the word of\
10:40\
god\
10:41\
as far as it is translated correctly\
10:44\
we also believe the book of mormon to be\
10:46\
the word of god\
10:48\
thus\
10:49\
the teachings of the savior as recorded\
10:51\
in the holy scriptures are also the word\
10:56\
let me suggest that holding fast to the\
10:59\
word of god entails one\
11:01\
remembering honoring and strengthening\
11:04\
the personal connection we have with the\
11:07\
savior and his father\
11:09\
through the covenants and ordinances of\
11:11\
the restored gospel and two\
11:14\
prayerfully earnestly and consistently\
11:18\
using the holy scriptures and the\
11:20\
teachings of living prophets and\
11:22\
apostles\
11:23\
as sure sources of revealed truth\
11:28\
as we are bound and hold fast to the\
11:30\
lord and are transformed by his by\
11:33\
living his doctrine\
11:35\
i promise that individually and\
11:37\
collectively\
11:39\
we will be blessed to stand in holy\
11:42\
places\
11:43\
and shall not be moved\
11:45\
if we abide in christ\
11:48\
then he will abide in and walk with us\
11:52\
surely\
11:53\
in the days of trial\
11:55\
his saints he will cheer\
11:57\
and prosper the cause of truth\
12:01\
press on\
12:03\
hold fast\
12:06\
heed not\
12:08\
i witnessed the\
12:09\
fidelity to the covenants and ordinances\
12:12\
of the savior's restored gospel\
12:15\
enables us to press on in the work of\
12:17\
the lord\
12:19\
to hold fast to him\
12:21\
as the word of god and to heed not the\
12:25\
allurements of the adversary\
12:29\
in the fight\
12:31\
for right\
12:33\
may each of us will the sword\
12:36\
even the mighty sword of truth\
12:40\
in the sacred name of the lord jesus\
12:42\
christ amen\
12:58\
you\
