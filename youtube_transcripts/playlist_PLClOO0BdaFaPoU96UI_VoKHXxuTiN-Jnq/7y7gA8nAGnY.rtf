after receiving an invitation to come\
0:03\
and see i attended the church of jesus\
0:06\
christ of latter-day saints for the\
0:08\
first time at the age of 26.\
0:11\
i had recently separated from my first\
0:13\
husband i had a three-year-old boy\
0:17\
and i felt powerless with fear\
0:19\
when i entered that building i was\
0:22\
filled with warmth as i perceived the\
0:25\
faith and joy of the people surrounding\
0:27\
me\
0:28\
it was truly a refuge from the storm\
0:32\
three weeks later i made the baptismal\
0:34\
covenant with heavenly father and\
0:37\
started my journey as a disciple of\
0:39\
christ\
0:40\
although my life has not been perfect\
0:42\
along that journey\
0:44\
for me to receive those eternal\
0:46\
blessings\
0:47\
many physical and spiritual elements had\
0:50\
to be in place\
0:51\
the gospel of jesus christ had been\
0:53\
restored and preached\
0:55\
that meeting house had been built and\
0:57\
maintained\
0:59\
there was an ecclesiastical structure\
1:01\
from the prophet to local leaders\
1:04\
and a branch filled by covenant members\
1:07\
was ready to embrace me and my son as we\
1:10\
were brought to the savior\
1:12\
nourished by the good word of god and\
1:15\
given opportunities to serve\
1:18\
from the beginning god has sought to\
1:20\
gather and organize his children to\
1:23\
bring to pass our immortality and\
1:26\
eternal life\
1:28\
with that purpose in mind he has\
1:30\
instructed us to build places of worship\
1:34\
where we receive knowledge and the\
1:36\
ordinances of salvation and exaltation\
1:39\
make and keep covenants that bind us to\
1:42\
jesus christ\
1:44\
are endowed with the power of godliness\
1:47\
and gather together often to remember\
1:50\
jesus and strengthen each other in him\
1:54\
the church organization and its\
1:56\
buildings exist for our spiritual\
2:00\
benefit\
2:01\
the church is the scaffolding with which\
2:03\
we build eternal families\
2:07\
while talking to a friend going through\
2:09\
a difficult time\
2:11\
i asked how he was surviving financially\
2:14\
in tears he replied that his bishop was\
2:18\
helping him using fast offering funds\
2:21\
he added\
2:22\
i don't know where my family and i will\
2:24\
be if it wasn't for the church\
2:27\
i replied\
2:29\
the church is the members\
2:31\
they are the ones who willingly and\
2:33\
joyfully give fast offerings to help\
2:35\
those of us in need\
2:38\
you are receiving the fruits of their\
2:40\
faith and determination to follow jesus\
2:43\
christ\
2:44\
my fellow disciples of christ\
2:47\
let us not underestimate the marvelous\
2:49\
work the lord is doing through us\
2:51\
his church despite our shortcomings\
2:55\
sometimes we are givers and sometimes we\
2:57\
are receivers but we are all one family\
3:00\
in christ\
3:01\
his church is the structure he has given\
3:04\
to guide and bless us as we worship him\
3:08\
and serve each other\
3:10\
some sisters have apologized to me\
3:13\
thinking they are not active members of\
3:14\
religious society because they are\
3:16\
serving in primary or young women\
3:19\
those sisters are among the most active\
3:22\
members of relief society because they\
3:24\
are helping our\
3:25\
precious children and youth strengthen\
3:28\
their faith in jesus christ\
3:31\
relief society is not limited to a room\
3:33\
in a building a sunday lesson an\
3:36\
activity or a presidency at the local or\
3:39\
general level\
3:40\
relief society is the covenant women of\
3:42\
the church it is us\
3:45\
each of us and all of us\
3:47\
it is our global community of compassion\
3:50\
and service\
3:52\
anywhere and everywhere we go we are\
3:54\
always part of relief society as we\
3:57\
strive to fulfill is divine purpose\
4:00\
which is for women to accomplish god's\
4:02\
work in individual as well as collective\
4:05\
ways by providing relief\
4:08\
relief of poverty relief of illness\
4:12\
relief of doubt relief of ignorance\
4:15\
relief of all that hinders joy and\
4:18\
progress\
4:20\
similar belonging exists in elders\
4:22\
forums and organizations of the church\
4:25\
for all ages\
4:26\
including our children and youth\
4:29\
the church is more than the buildings\
4:31\
and the ecclesiastical structure\
4:33\
the church is us the members\
4:36\
we are the church of jesus christ of\
4:38\
latter-day saints with christ at the\
4:41\
head\
4:42\
and the prophet as his mouthpiece\
4:46\
the lord has said\
4:48\
behold this is my doctrine whosoever\
4:51\
repenteth and cometh unto me the same is\
4:55\
my church\
4:56\
and whosoever is of my church and the\
4:59\
endureth of my church to the end\
5:02\
him will i establish upon my rock\
5:05\
sisters and brothers\
5:07\
let us realize how privileged we are to\
5:10\
belong to the church of jesus christ\
5:13\
where we can unite our faith hearts\
5:15\
strengths minds and hands for him to\
5:18\
perform his mighty miracles\
5:21\
for the body of christ church is not one\
5:24\
member but many\
5:27\
a teenage boy told his mother\
5:30\
when i was little\
5:31\
every time i gave one dollar in tithing\
5:35\
i thought that with that one dollar a\
5:37\
whole meeting house will be built\
5:41\
isn't that silly\
5:43\
touched she replied\
5:45\
that is lovely\
5:47\
did you picture them in your mind\
5:50\
yes he exclaimed\
5:52\
they were beautiful\
5:54\
and there were millions of them\
5:56\
my dear friends\
5:58\
let us have the faith of a child and\
6:01\
rejoicing knowing that even our smallest\
6:05\
efforts are making a significant\
6:07\
difference in god's kingdom\
6:10\
our purpose in his kingdom should be to\
6:12\
bring each other to christ\
6:14\
as we read in the scriptures\
6:16\
the savior extended this invitation to\
6:19\
the nephites\
6:20\
have ye any that are sick among you\
6:24\
bring them here\
6:26\
have ye any that are afflicted in any\
6:28\
manner\
6:30\
bring them either and i will heal them\
6:33\
for i have compassion upon you\
6:35\
my bowels are filled with mercy\
6:38\
i see that your faith is sufficient that\
6:41\
i should heal you\
6:43\
do we not all have afflictions that can\
6:45\
be brought to the savior's feet once\
6:48\
while some of us have physical\
6:50\
challenges many more battle with\
6:52\
emotional strife\
6:54\
others struggle to nurture social\
6:56\
connections and we all seek respite when\
7:00\
our spirits are challenged\
7:02\
we are all afflicted in some some manner\
7:06\
we read that\
7:08\
all the multitude with one accord\
7:10\
did go forth with their sick and with\
7:13\
all them that were afflicted in any\
7:15\
manner and he did heal them\
7:18\
everyone as they were brought forth unto\
7:21\
him\
7:22\
and they did all\
7:24\
both they who had been healed\
7:26\
and they who were who\
7:28\
bowed down at his feet and did worship\
7:31\
him\
7:32\
from a little boy who is based tiding\
7:34\
with faith\
7:36\
to a single mother in need of the lord's\
7:38\
empowering grace\
7:40\
to a father struggling to provide for\
7:42\
his family to our ancestors in need of\
7:45\
the ordinances of salvation and\
7:47\
exaltation\
7:49\
to each of us who renews covenants with\
7:51\
god every week\
7:53\
we need each other\
7:55\
and we can bring each other to the\
7:57\
savior's redeeming healing\
8:00\
my dear sisters and brothers let us\
8:02\
follow jesus christ's invitation to\
8:04\
bring ourselves and our afflictions to\
8:07\
him\
8:08\
when we come to him and bring those we\
8:10\
love to him he sees our faith\
8:13\
he will make them whole\
8:16\
and he will make us whole\
8:18\
as the peaceable followers of christ\
8:21\
we are striving to become of one heart\
8:24\
and one mind and to be humble submissive\
8:28\
gentle easy to being treated\
8:31\
full of patience and long suffering\
8:34\

8:38\
