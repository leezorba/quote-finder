I will speak about self-reliance and how\
it can be taught to children\
0:06\
and to youth.\
0:07\
Self-reliance may be perceived as being\
a subject matter for adults.\
0:12\
I've come to know that adults can best\
be on the path towards self-reliance\
0:17\
when they have been taught the gospel of\
Jesus Christ and have practiced its\
0:21\
doctrine and principles since childhood\
and as youth in the home.\
0:27\
The best illustration is the great real-\
life example.\
0:30\
Wilfried Vanie, his seven siblings, and\
his mother joined\
0:35\
the Church in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, when\
he was six years old.\
0:40\
He was baptized at eight.\
0:42\
His father, the main provider in the\
family, died when he was 11.\
0:47\
Though saddened by the family situation,\
Wilfried decided to continue\
0:52\
in school with his mother's\
encouragement and with Church support.\
0:57\
He graduated from secondary school and\
served a full-time mission in\
1:02\
the Ghana Cape Coast Mission, where he\
learned English.\
1:05\
After his mission, he went on to the\
university and obtained a diploma\
1:10\
in accounting and finance.\
1:12\
Though it was hard to obtain employment\
in this field, he found work in\
1:17\
the tourism and hospitality industry.\
1:20\
He started as a waiter in a five star\
hotel, but his passion to improve\
1:25\
pushed him to learn more until he became\
a bilingual receptionist there.\
1:32\
When a new hotel opened, he was hired as\
the night auditor.\
1:37\
Later, he enrolled in BYU Pathway\
Connect and is currently studying\
1:42\
a course to obtain a certificate in\
tourism and hotels.\
1:47\
His desire is to one day become the\
manager of a high-end hotel.\
1:53\
Wilfried can provide for his eternal\
companion and two children, as well\
1:58\
as help his mother and his siblings.\
2:01\
He currently serves in the Church as a\
member of the stake high council.\
2:06\
Self-reliance is defined as, quote, "the\
ability,\
2:10\
commitment, and effort to provide the\
spiritual and temporal necessities\
2:15\
of life for self and family," close\
quote.\
2:20\
Striving to be self-reliant is part of\
our work along the covenant path that\
2:26\
leads us back to Heavenly Father and to\
His Son, Jesus Christ.\
2:31\
It will strengthen our faith in Jesus\
Christ and joyfully bind us to Him\
2:36\
through the covenants and ordinances of\
salvation and exaltation.\
2:41\
Self-reliance is a doctrine of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ, not\
2:45\
a program.\
2:46\
It is a process that lasts a lifetime,\
not an event.\
2:51\
We become self-reliant throughout our\
lives by growing in spiritual\
2:56\
strength, physical and emotional health,\
pursuing our education\
3:01\
and employment, and being temporally\
prepared.\
3:05\
Is this task ever finished during\
3:08\
our lives? No.\
3:09\
It is a lifelong process of learning,\
growth, and work.\
3:14\
It never ends.\
3:15\
It is a continuous, daily process.\
3:18\
How can we teach the doctrine and\
principles of self-reliance to our\
3:23\
children and youth?\
3:25\
One important way is to regularly apply\
the principles of the Children\
3:29\
and Youth Development Program.\
3:32\
Parents and children learn the gospel of\
Jesus Christ, participate in service\
3:37\
and activities, and work together in\
four areas of personal development that\
3:43\
are unique for each child.\
3:46\
It is no longer the same Primary program\
for all.\
3:50\
The "Children's Guidebook" says, quote:\
"When Jesus was your\
3:54\
age, He learned and grew.\
3:57\
You are learning and growing too.\
4:00\
The scriptures say 'Jesus increased in\
wisdom and stature, and in favor with\
4:06\
God and man.'" This scripture refers to\
growth and learning in the spiritual\
4:12\
aspect, Favor with God; the social\
aspect, Favor with Man; The physical\
4:19\
aspect, Stature; and the intellectual\
aspect, Wisdom.\
4:24\
These developmental areas apply to all\
of us, no matter our age.\
4:29\
When do we teach them?\
4:31\
In Deuteronomy chapter 6, verses 6 and\
7, we read: "And these\
4:37\
words, which I command thee this day,\
shall be in thine heart: And thou\
4:42\
shalt teach them diligently unto thy\
children, and shall talk of them when\
4:47\
thou sittest in thine house, and when\
thou walkest by the way, and when thou\
4:53\
liest down, and when thou risest up." We\
teach these things to children by\
4:59\
our good example, working and serving\
with them, studying the\
5:04\
scriptures, and following the teachings\
of Jesus Christ\
5:08\
as taught by prophets.\
5:10\
I've mentioned that in the Children and\
Youth Development Program, children\
5:14\
choose different goals in each one of\
the four areas of development.\
5:19\
It is important that they create their\
own goals in each area.\
5:24\
Parents and leaders can teach, counsel,\
and support.\
5:28\
For example, our granddaughter Miranda\
is very motivated to grow spiritually\
5:33\
by participating in daily, early morning\
Seminary classes.\
5:39\
She became interested by hearing\
positive comments from other Seminary\
5:43\
students in her ward.\
5:45\
Her mother does not have to wake her up\
for class.\
5:48\
On her own, she is up and connected by\
videoconference at the appointed time\
5:54\
of 6:20 in the morning because she has\
developed good habits that help her to\
5:58\
do so.\
6:01\
My own parents told me recently that\
Miranda now talks more when she visits\
6:06\
them as she has grown in\
self-confidence.\
6:10\
These are lessons for life and growth\
with noticeable outcomes.\
6:16\
Parents, grandparents, leaders, and\
friends assist in\
6:20\
the growth and development of the\
children.\
6:23\
Fully engaged, ministering brothers and\
sisters, together with priesthood\
6:27\
and organization leaders of the ward,\
provide support.\
6:32\
"The Family: a Proclamation to the\
World" says: "By divine\
6:36\
design, fathers are to preside over\
their families in love\
6:41\
and righteousness and are responsible to\
provide the necessities of life\
6:46\
and protection for their families.\
6:49\
Mothers are primarily responsible for\
the nurture of their children.\
6:55\
In these sacred responsibilities,\
fathers and mothers\
6:59\
are obligated to help one another\
7:01\
as equal partners. ...\
7:04\
Extended families should lend support\
when needed." That last line refers to\
7:10\
grandparents, among others.\
7:13\
As we serve in West Africa, my wife,\
Nuria, has done a remarkable job\
7:19\
ministering and remaining connected with\
our family and grandchildren\
7:23\
across the ocean.\
7:25\
She does this by using technology.\
7:28\
She reads books to the younger\
grandchildren.\
7:31\
She teaches the older granddaughters\
topics like the story of our\
7:35\
family, science, history of Puerto Rico,\
the Articles of Faith, and\
7:41\
the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\
7:44\
Distances nowadays do not limit\
connecting, belonging, ministering\
7:50\
to, and teaching the rising generation\
of our families.\
7:55\
I also join in with Nuria when I can to\
teach our precious\
7:58\
grandchildren, to love them, and to\
spoil them and make them laugh.\
8:04\
You should notice the inspired\
similarities between Children\
8:09\
and Youth Development and building\
self-reliance.\
8:12\
The four areas of development in each\
are very similar.\
8:16\
Spiritual Strength in self-reliance\
relates with the Spiritual in Children\
8:21\
and Youth.\
8:22\
Physical and Emotional Health in\
self-reliance connect with\
8:27\
the Physical and Social in Children and\
Youth.\
8:30\
Education, Employment, and Temporal\
Preparedness in self-reliance are akin\
8:36\
to the Intellectual in the Children and\
Youth Development Program.\
8:40\
In closing, let us follow our Savior,\
Jesus Christ, and His Gospel by\
8:45\
becoming self-reliant throughout our\
lives and teaching this to our children\
8:50\
and youth.\
8:52\
We can do this best by: 1.\
8:54\
Being good examples of service to\
others.\
8:58\
2.\
8:59\
Living and teaching the doctrine and\
principles of self-reliance.\
9:03\
3.\
9:04\
Obeying the commandment to build\
self-reliance as part of the gospel of\
9:09\
Jesus Christ.\
9:10\
Doctrine and Covenants Section 104,\
verses 15 and 16, says, "And it is\
9:17\
my purpose to provide for my saints, for\
all things are mine.\
9:21\
But it must needs be done in mine own\
way; And behold, this is the way that\
9:27\
I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for\
my saints, that the poor shall be\
9:32\
exalted, in that the rich are made low."\
This is the Church of Jesus Christ.\
9:40\
His Gospel blesses families here on\
earth and throughout\
9:43\
the eternities.\
9:45\
It guides us in our lives as we strive\
to become eternal families.\
9:51\
I know this is true.\
9:53\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
