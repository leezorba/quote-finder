Friends, brothers, and sisters, we each\
have a story.\
0:07\
As we discover our story, we connect, we\
belong, we become.\
0:15\
My name is Gerrit Walter Gong.\
0:18\
Gerrit is a Dutch name.\
0:20\
Walter, my father's name, is an American\
name.\
0:24\
Gong, of course, is a Chinese name.\
0:28\
Experts estimate some 70 to 110 billion\
people have lived on the earth.\
0:35\
Perhaps only one has been named Gerrit\
Walter Gong.\
0:42\
We each have a story.\
0:44\
I love the rain on my face and the wind\
as it rushes by.\
0:48\
I waddle with penguins in Antarctica.\
0:52\
I give orphans in Guatemala, street,\
kids in Cambodia, Maasai women\
0:57\
in the African Mara their first very own\
photo of themselves.\
1:03\
I wait at the hospital as each of our\
children is born.\
1:07\
Once, the doctor has me help.\
1:10\
I trust God.\
1:11\
I believe we are that we might have joy,\
that there are times and seasons\
1:17\
to everything under heaven.\
1:19\
Do you know your story?\
1:22\
what your name means?\
1:25\
World population grew from 1.1 billion\
people in 1820\
1:30\
to nearly 7.8 billion in 2020.\
1:34\
The year 1820 seems to be an inflection\
point in history.\
1:39\
Many born after 1820\
1:41\
have living memory and records to\
identify several family generations.\
1:48\
Can you think of a special, sweet memory\
with a grandparent or other\
1:53\
family member?\
1:55\
Whatever the total number of individuals\
who have lived on\
1:58\
the earth, it is finite, countable, one\
person at a time.\
2:04\
You and I, we each matter.\
2:07\
And please consider this.\
2:09\
Whether or not we know them, we're each\
born of a mother and father.\
2:13\
And each mother and father is born of a\
mother and father by birth\
2:18\
or adoptive lineage.\
2:20\
We're ultimately all connected in the\
family of God and in the human family.\
2:28\
Born AD 837, my 30th great-grandfather\
First Dragon Gong started our family\
2:35\
village in southern China.\
2:38\
The first time I visited Gong village,\
the people said, "Wenhan\
2:42\
huilaile" ("Gerrit has returned").\
2:47\
On my mother's side, our living family\
tree includes thousands of family names\
2:51\
with more to discover.\
2:54\
We each have more family with whom to\
connect.\
2:57\
If you think your great-aunt has\
completed all your family\
3:01\
genealogy, please find your cousins and\
cousins' cousins.\
3:06\
Connect your living memory family names\
with the 10 billion searchable names\
3:11\
FamilySearch now has in its online\
collection and the 1.3 billion\
3:16\
individuals in its family tree.\
3:20\
Ask friends or family to draw a living\
tree.\
3:24\
As President Russell M.\
3:25\
Nelson teaches, living trees have\
branches and roots.\
3:31\
Whether you or your first or tenth known\
generation, connect yesterday\
3:35\
for tomorrow.\
3:37\
Connect the roots and branches in your\
living family tree.\
3:43\
The question "Where are you from?" asks\
lineage, birthplace, home,\
3:48\
country, or homeland.\
3:50\
Globally, 25% of us trace our homeland\
to China, 23% to India, 17% to other\
3:58\
Asia Pacific, 18% to Europe, 10% to\
Africa, 7% to the Americas.\
4:07\
The question "Where are you from?" also\
invites us to discover our divine\
4:13\
identity and spiritual purpose in life.\
4:17\
We each have a story.\
4:19\
A family I know connected five family\
generations when they visited their old\
4:24\
home in Winnipeg, Canada.\
4:27\
There, the grandfather told his\
grandsons about the day two\
4:30\
missionaries- he called them angels from\
heaven- brought the restored\
4:35\
gospel of Jesus Christ, changing their\
family forever.\
4:41\
A mother I know invited her children and\
their cousins to ask their great-\
4:45\
grandmother about her childhood\
experiences.\
4:50\
Great-grandma's adventures and life\
lessons are now a treasured family book\
4:54\
uniting generations.\
4:57\
A young man I know is compiling a dad\
journal.\
5:01\
Years ago, a car hit and killed his\
father.\
5:04\
Now to know his father, this courageous\
young man is preserving childhood\
5:09\
memories and stories from family and\
friends.\
5:13\
When asked where meaning comes in life,\
most people rank family first.\
5:20\
This includes family living and gone\
before.\
5:24\
Of course, when we die, we don't cease\
to exist.\
5:29\
We continue to live on the other side of\
the veil.\
5:33\
Still very much alive, our ancestors\
deserve to be remembered.\
5:39\
We remember our heritage through oral\
histories, clan records and family\
5:43\
stories, memorials or places of\
remembrance, celebrations with\
5:48\
photos, foods, or items which remind us\
of loved ones.\
5:53\
Think of where you live.\
5:55\
Isn't it wonderful how your country and\
community remember and honor\
6:00\
ancestors, family, others who served and\
sacrificed?\
6:05\
For example, at the Harvest Remembrance\
in South Molton, Devonshire,\
6:10\
England, Sister Gong and I loved finding\
the little church\
6:14\
and community where generations of our\
Baden family lived.\
6:18\
We honor our ancestors by opening the\
heavens through temple and family\
6:23\
history work and by becoming a welding\
link in the chain of our generations.\
6:30\
In this age of "I choose me," societies\
benefit when generations connect in\
6:36\
meaningful ways.\
6:38\
We need roots to have wings, real\
relationships, meaningful\
6:42\
service, life beyond fleeting social\
media veneers.\
6:47\
Connecting with our ancestors can change\
our lives in surprising ways.\
6:53\
From their trials and accomplishments,\
we gain faith\
6:56\
and strength.\
6:57\
From their love and sacrifices, we learn\
to forgive\
7:00\
and move forward.\
7:01\
Our children become resilient.\
7:04\
We gain protection and power.\
7:07\
Ties with ancestors increase family\
closeness, gratitude, miracles.\
7:12\
Such ties can bring help from the other\
side of the veil.\
7:17\
Just as joys come in families, so can\
sorrows.\
7:22\
No individual is perfect, nor is any\
family.\
7:26\
When those who should love, nurture, and\
protect us fail to do\
7:29\
so, we feel abandoned, embarrassed,\
hurt.\
7:34\
Family can become a hollow shell.\
7:37\
Yet with heaven's help, we can come to\
understand our family and make peace\
7:43\
with each other.\
7:45\
Sometimes unwavering commitment to\
abiding family relationships helps us\
7:49\
accomplish hard things.\
7:50\
In some cases, community becomes family.\
7:55\
A remarkable young woman whose troubled\
family moved frequently found a loving\
7:59\
church family wherever she was to\
nurture and give her place.\
8:05\
Genetics and family patterns influence\
but do not determine us.\
8:10\
God wants our families to be happy and\
forever.\
8:13\
Forever is too long if we make each\
other unhappy, and happy is too short\
8:19\
if cherished relationships stop with\
this life.\
8:23\
Through sacred covenants, Jesus Christ\
offers His love, power, and grace to\
8:28\
change us and heal our relationships.\
8:31\
Selfless temple service for dear ones\
makes our Savior's Atonement real\
8:37\
for them and us.\
8:39\
Sanctified we can return home to God's\
presence as families united eternally.\
8:47\
Each of our stories is a journey still\
in progress as we discover,\
8:51\
create, and become with possibilities\
beyond imagination.\
8:57\
The Prophet Joseph said,\
â€œIt may seem to some.. .\
9:00\
a bold doctrine that we [speak] of- a\
power which records or binds\
9:04\
on earth and binds in heaven." The\
sociality we create here can exist with\
9:10\
the eternal glory there.\
9:12\
Indeed, we without our family members\
cannot be made perfect.\
9:16\
Neither can they without us be made\
perfect.\
9:20\
What can we do now?\
9:22\
First, imagine your image reflected back\
and forth\
9:26\
between two mirrors of eternity.\
9:28\
In one direction, picture yourself as\
daughter,\
9:31\
granddaughter, great-granddaughter.\
9:34\
In the other direction, smile at\
yourself as aunt, mother, grandmother.\
9:39\
In each time and role, notice who's with\
you.\
9:42\
Gather their photos and stories.\
9:44\
Make their memories real.\
9:46\
Record their names, experiences, key\
dates.\
9:50\
They're your family- the family you will\
have and the family you want.\
9:56\
As you perform temple ordinances for\
family members, a manifestation of\
10:00\
the Holy Ghost, the spirit of Elijah\
will knit the hearts of your\
10:05\
fathers, mothers, and children together\
in love.\
10:09\
Second, let the adventure of family\
history be intentional\
10:12\
and spontaneous.\
10:14\
Call your grandmother.\
10:15\
Look deeply into the eyes of that new\
baby.\
10:19\
Learn and acknowledge with gratitude and\
honesty your family heritage.\
10:23\
Celebrate and become the positive.\
10:26\
And where needed, humbly do everything\
possible not to pass on the negative.\
10:32\
Let good things begin with you.\
10:35\
Third, visit FamilySearch.org.\
10:39\
Download the available mobile apps.\
10:41\
See how you're related to people in the\
room.\
10:44\
How easy and rewarding it is to add\
names to your living family tree.\
10:49\
Fourth, help unite families eternally.\
10:53\
Remember the demographics of heaven.\
10:56\
There are more on the other side of the\
veil than on this side.\
11:00\
As more temples come closer to us,\
please offer those waiting\
11:05\
for temple ordinances opportunity to\
receive them.\
11:10\
The promise at Easter and always is that\
in and through Jesus\
11:15\
Christ, we become our best story and our\
families can become happy\
11:21\
and forever.\
11:22\
In all our generations, Jesus Christ\
heals the brokenhearted, delivers\
11:28\
the captives, sets at liberty them that\
are bruised.\
11:32\
Covenant belonging with God and each\
other includes knowing our spirit\
11:37\
and body will be reunited in\
resurrection, and our most precious\
11:42\
relationships can continue beyond death\
with a fulness of joy.\
11:49\
We each have a story.\
11:51\
Come discover yours.\
11:53\
Come find your voice, your song, your\
harmony in Him.\
11:58\
This is the very purpose for which God\
created the heavens and the earth\
12:04\
and saw that they were good.\
12:08\
Praise God's plan of happiness, Jesus\
Christ's\
12:12\
Atonement, continuing restoration in His\
gospel and Church.\
12:18\
Please come find your family, all your\
generations, and bring them home.\
12:27\
In the sacred and holy name of Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
