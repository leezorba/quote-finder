my dear brothers and sisters\
0:04\
as we experience sobering days of\
0:06\
commotion\
0:07\
contention and for many deep suffering\
0:11\
our hearts are filled with overwhelming\
0:12\
gratitude for our savior and the eternal\
0:15\
blessings of the restored gospel of\
0:18\
jesus christ\
0:19\
we love him and we trust him and we pray\
0:22\
that we will forever follow him\
0:25\
the powerful impact of the internet\
0:28\
is a blessing and a challenge\
0:31\
unique to our time\
0:34\
in a world of social media and\
0:35\
information super highways\
0:38\
one person's voice can be multiplied\
0:40\
exponentially\
0:42\
that voice whether true or false\
0:46\
whether fair or prejudicial\
0:48\
whether kind or cruel\
0:50\
moves instantly across the world\
0:54\
social media posts of thoughtfulness and\
0:56\
goodness\
0:57\
are often quietly under the radar\
1:00\
while words of contempt and anger\
1:03\
are frequently thundering in our ears\
1:06\
whether with political philosophy\
1:09\
people in the news or opinions on the\
1:12\
pandemic\
1:14\
no one\
1:15\
or no subject\
1:17\
is immune from this social phenomenon of\
1:20\
polarized voices\
1:22\
including\
1:23\
the savior and his restored gospel\
1:27\
the sermon on the mount is a message for\
1:29\
all\
1:30\
but was specifically given to the\
1:32\
savior's disciples\
1:34\
those who had chosen to follow him\
1:37\
the lord taught how to live then and now\
1:41\
in a contemptuous world\
1:43\
blessed are the peacemakers he declared\
1:47\
for they shall be called the children of\
1:49\
god\
1:51\
by the shield of our faith in jesus\
1:53\
christ\
1:54\
we become peacemakers\
1:56\
quenching\
1:57\
meaning to calm\
1:59\
cool or extinguish all the five regards\
2:02\
of the adversary\
2:04\
as we do our part\
2:06\
his promise is that we will be called\
2:10\
the children of god\
2:13\
every person on earth\
2:14\
is the offspring of god\
2:17\
but to be called the children of god\
2:19\
means much much more as we come unto\
2:23\
jesus christ and make covenants with him\
2:26\
we become his seed and heirs of the\
2:29\
kingdom\
2:30\
children of christ his sons and his\
2:34\
daughters\
2:37\
how does a peacemaker calm and cool the\
2:39\
fiery darts\
2:41\
certainly not by shrinking before those\
2:44\
who disparage us\
2:46\
rather we remain confident in our faith\
2:49\
sharing our beliefs with conviction but\
2:52\
always void of anger or malice\
2:57\
recently after a strongly worded opinion\
3:00\
piece that was critical of the church\
3:02\
reverend amos brown\
3:04\
a national civil rights leader and\
3:07\
pastor of the third baptist church in\
3:10\
san francisco responded\
3:14\
i respect the experience and perspective\
3:16\
of the individual who wrote those words\
3:20\
granted\
3:21\
i don't see what he sees\
3:23\
i counted one of my life's greatest joys\
3:27\
to know these leaders of the church\
3:28\
including president russell m nelson\
3:32\
they are in my estimation the embodiment\
3:36\
of the best leadership our country has\
3:38\
to offer\
3:40\
he then added\
3:42\
we can gripe about the way things were\
3:44\
we can refuse to acknowledge all the\
3:47\
good going on\
3:48\
but these approaches will not heal our\
3:51\
national divisions\
3:53\
as jesus taught\
3:55\
we don't eradicate evil with more evil\
3:59\
we love generously and live mercifully\
4:02\
even toward those we think to be our\
4:05\
enemies\
4:08\
reverend brown\
4:09\
is a peacemaker\
4:11\
he calmly and respectfully cooled the\
4:14\
fiery darts\
4:16\
peacemakers are not passive\
4:19\
they are persuasive\
4:20\
in the savior's way\
4:24\
what gives us the inner strength to cool\
4:27\
calm and quench\
4:28\
the fiery darts aim toward the truths we\
4:31\
love\
4:33\
the strength comes from our faith in\
4:35\
jesus christ and our faith in his words\
4:39\
blessed are ye\
4:40\
when men shall revile you and shall say\
4:43\
all manner of evil against you falsely\
4:46\
for my sake\
4:48\
for great is your reward in heaven for\
4:51\
so persecuted they the prophets which\
4:53\
were before you\
4:57\
two important principles guide our\
4:59\
desire to be peacemakers\
5:02\
first\
5:03\
our heavenly father has given each\
5:05\
individual\
5:06\
his or her moral agency with the ability\
5:10\
to choose one's own path\
5:13\
this agency is one of the greatest gifts\
5:16\
of god\
5:19\
second\
5:20\
with this agency\
5:22\
our heavenly father allowed for\
5:24\
opposition in all things\
5:27\
we taste the bitter that we may notice\
5:30\
the good\
5:32\
opposition should not surprise us\
5:36\
we learn to distinguish good from evil\
5:40\
we rejoice in the blessing of agency\
5:44\
understanding that there will be many\
5:45\
who do not believe what we believe\
5:48\
in fact\
5:49\
few in the latter days will choose to\
5:52\
make their faith in jesus christ\
5:54\
central\
5:55\
to all they think and do\
6:00\
because of social media platforms\
6:03\
one voice of disbelief can appear to be\
6:05\
a multitude of negative voices\
6:07\
but even if it is a multitude of voices\
6:11\
we choose the path of peacemakers\
6:17\
some view the first presidency in the\
6:19\
quorum of the twelve as having worldly\
6:21\
motives like political business and\
6:24\
cultural leaders\
6:26\
however we come very differently to our\
6:29\
responsibilities\
6:31\
we are not elected or selected from\
6:33\
applications\
6:35\
without any specific professional\
6:37\
preparation\
6:39\
we are called\
6:40\
and ordained to bear testimony of the\
6:42\
name of jesus christ\
6:45\
throughout all the world until our final\
6:47\
breath\
6:49\
we endeavor to bless the sick\
6:51\
the lonely the down-hearted\
6:54\
and the poor and to strengthen the\
6:56\
kingdom of god\
6:58\
we seek to know the lord's will\
7:01\
and to proclaim it\
7:03\
especially to those who seek eternal\
7:05\
life\
7:08\
although our humble desire is for the\
7:10\
savior's teachings to be honored by all\
7:14\
the words of the lord through his\
7:16\
prophets\
7:17\
are often contrary to the thinking and\
7:19\
trends of the world\
7:21\
it's always been so\
7:23\
the savior said to his apostles if the\
7:26\
world hates you ye know that it hated me\
7:29\
before it hated you\
7:31\
all these things will they do\
7:33\
because they know not him\
7:36\
that sent me\
7:40\
we genuinely love and care for all our\
7:42\
neighbors whether or not they believe as\
7:44\
we do\
7:46\
jesus taught us in the parable of the\
7:48\
good samaritan that those of different\
7:51\
beliefs should sincerely reach out to\
7:53\
help everyone in need being peacemakers\
7:56\
pursuing good and noble causes\
8:00\
in february a headline in the arizona\
8:03\
republic stated\
8:05\
bipartisan bills supported by latter-day\
8:08\
saints\
8:09\
would protect gay and transgender\
8:12\
arizonans\
8:15\
we as latter-day saints\
8:17\
are pleased to be part of a coalition\
8:20\
of faith\
8:21\
business lgbtq people and community\
8:25\
leaders\
8:26\
who have worked together in a spirit of\
8:28\
trust\
8:29\
and mutual respect\
8:32\
president russell m nelson once\
8:34\
thoughtfully asked\
8:36\
can we not\
8:37\
cannot boundary lines exist without\
8:40\
becoming battle lines\
8:43\
we endeavor to be peaceable followers of\
8:46\
christ\
8:49\
some of the attacks upon the savior were\
8:51\
so malicious that he said nothing\
8:54\
and the chief priests and scribes\
8:56\
vehemently accused him\
8:58\
and mocked him\
9:00\
but jesus answered them nothing\
9:03\
there are times when being a peacemaker\
9:06\
means that we resist the impulse to\
9:08\
respond\
9:10\
and instead with dignity\
9:12\
remain quiet\
9:15\
it is heartbreaking for all of us\
9:18\
when harsh or dismissive words about the\
9:21\
savior his followers and his church\
9:25\
are spoken or published by those who\
9:28\
once stood with us took the sacrament\
9:30\
with us and testified with us of the\
9:33\
divine mission of jesus christ\
9:37\
this is this also happened during the\
9:39\
savior's ministry\
9:41\
some of the disciples of jesus who were\
9:44\
with him during his most majestic\
9:46\
miracles\
9:47\
determined to walk no more with him\
9:51\
sadly\
9:53\
not all will remain firm in their love\
9:55\
for the savior and their determination\
9:58\
to keep his commandments\
10:02\
jesus taught us to withdraw from the\
10:04\
circle of anger and contention\
10:07\
in one example after the pharisees\
10:09\
confronted jesus and counseled how they\
10:12\
might destroy him\
10:13\
the scriptures say\
10:15\
that jesus withdrew himself from them\
10:18\
and miracles occurred as great\
10:21\
multitudes followed him and he healed\
10:24\
them all\
10:26\
we too\
10:27\
can move away from contention and bless\
10:30\
the lives of others while not isolating\
10:33\
ourselves in our own corner\
10:37\
in mujimai democratic republic of the\
10:39\
congo\
10:41\
initially some were critical of the\
10:42\
church not understanding our beliefs or\
10:45\
knowing our members\
10:48\
some time ago kathy and i attended a\
10:51\
very special church service in mujimai\
10:54\
the children were dressed immaculately\
10:56\
with bright eyes and big smiles\
11:00\
i had hoped to speak to them\
11:02\
about their education\
11:04\
but learned that many were not attending\
11:06\
school\
11:08\
our leaders with very nominal\
11:11\
humanitarian funds\
11:13\
found a way to help\
11:15\
now more than 400 students girls and\
11:18\
boys\
11:19\
members as well as those not of our\
11:22\
faith\
11:23\
are welcomed and taught by 16 teachers\
11:26\
who are members of the church of jesus\
11:29\
christ\
11:30\
14 year old kalonga muya said\
11:34\
having little money\
11:36\
i spent four years without attending\
11:38\
school\
11:40\
i am so grateful for what the church has\
11:42\
done\
11:44\
i can now read write\
11:46\
and speak french\
11:49\
speaking of this initiative the mayor of\
11:51\
mujimai said\
11:53\
i am inspired by the church of jesus\
11:55\
christ of latter-day saints\
11:57\
because while other churches are being\
11:59\
divided each one in his corner\
12:02\
you are working with others to help the\
12:04\
community in need\
12:10\
time i read john chapter 13\
12:13\
i am reminded of the savior's perfect\
12:15\
example as a peacemaker\
12:18\
jesus lovingly washed the feet of the\
12:19\
apostles\
12:21\
then we read\
12:22\
that he was troubled in his spirit\
12:25\
as he thought about one he loved\
12:28\
preparing to betray him\
12:30\
i've tried to imagine the thoughts and\
12:32\
feelings of the savior\
12:34\
as judas left\
12:36\
interestingly at that sobering moment\
12:40\
jesus spoke no more about his troubling\
12:42\
feelings\
12:43\
or about betrayal\
12:46\
rather he spoke to his apostles about\
12:49\
love\
12:50\
his words cascading through the\
12:51\
centuries\
12:53\
a new commandment i give unto you\
12:55\
that ye love one another\
12:57\
as i have loved you\
12:59\
by this shall all men know that ye are\
13:02\
my disciples\
13:04\
if ye have love\
13:05\
one to another\
13:07\
may we love him\
13:09\
and love one another\
13:11\
may we be peacemakers that we may be\
13:13\
called the children of god\
13:16\
i pray\
13:17\
in the name of jesus christ amen\
13:35\
you\
