I am grateful for President Russell M.\
0:04\
Nelson's powerful prophetic call to\
missionary service and President M.\
0:10\
Russell Ballard's and Elder Marcos\
Aidukaitis's inspiring missionary\
0:14\
messages today.\
0:17\
A missionary assignment to Great Britain\
late last year allowed me to\
0:21\
reflect on the precious spiritual events\
that were foundational to my\
0:27\
decision to serve as a missionary.\
0:29\
When I was 15 years old, my beloved\
older brother, Joe, was 20- the age of\
0:35\
eligibility then to serve a mission.\
0:39\
In the United States, because of the\
Korean conflict, very few were\
0:43\
allowed to serve.\
0:45\
Only one could be called from each ward\
per year.\
0:49\
It was a surprise when our bishop asked\
Joe to explore this possibility with\
0:54\
our father.\
0:56\
Joe had been preparing applications for\
medical school.\
1:00\
Our father, who was not active in the\
Church, had made financial\
1:03\
preparations to help him and was not in\
favor of Joe going on a mission.\
1:10\
Dad suggested that Joe could do more\
good by going to medical school.\
1:15\
This was a huge issue in our family.\
1:19\
In a remarkable discussion with my wise\
and exemplary older brother, we\
1:26\
concluded that his decision on whether\
to serve a mission and delay\
1:31\
his education depended on three\
questions: (1) Is Jesus Christ divine?\
1:39\
(2) Is the Book of Mormon the word of\
God?\
1:41\
And (3) Is Joseph Smith the Prophet of\
the Restoration?\
1:47\
If the answer to these questions was\
yes, it was clear that Joe could do\
1:52\
more good taking the gospel of Jesus\
Christ to the world than becoming\
1:57\
a doctor at an earlier date.\
2:00\
That night I prayed fervently and and\
with real intent.\
2:05\
The Spirit, in an undeniably powerful\
way, confirmed to me that the answers\
2:12\
to all three of these questions were\
true.\
2:15\
This was a seminal event for me.\
2:19\
I realized that every decision I would\
make for the rest of my life would be\
2:24\
influenced by these truths.\
2:27\
I also knew that I would serve a mission\
if given the opportunity.\
2:32\
Over a lifetime of service and spiritual\
experiences, I have come\
2:37\
to understand that true conversion is\
the result of the conscious acceptance\
2:43\
of the will of God, and we can be guided\
in our actions by the Holy Ghost.\
2:50\
I already had a testimony of the\
divinity of Jesus Christ as Savior\
2:55\
of the world.\
2:56\
That night I received a spiritual\
testimony of the Book of Mormon\
3:00\
and the Prophet Joseph Smith.\
3:02\
Your testimony will be strengthened when\
you know in your heart, through\
3:06\
your prayers, that the\
Prophet Joseph Smith\
3:09\
was an instrument\
in the Lord’s hands.\
3:13\
During the past eight years, one of my\
assignments in the Twelve Apostles was\
3:18\
to review and read all the remarkable\
Joseph Smith papers and documents\
3:24\
and the research that led to the\
publication of the Saints volumes.\
3:28\
My testimony and admiration of the\
Prophet Joseph Smith has been\
3:32\
greatly strengthened and enhanced after\
reading the inspiring details of his\
3:38\
life and foreordained prophetic\
ministry.\
3:43\
Joseph's translation of the Book of\
Mormon by the gift and power of God was\
3:48\
foundational to the Restoration.\
3:51\
The Book of Mormon is internally\
consistent, beautifully\
3:54\
written, and contains the answers to\
life's great questions.\
3:58\
It is another testament of Jesus Christ.\
4:03\
I testify that Joseph Smith was\
righteous, full of faith, and\
4:07\
an instrument in the Lord's hands in\
bringing forth the Book of Mormon.\
4:12\
The revelations and events recorded in\
the Doctrine and Covenants provide\
4:16\
the keys, ordinances, and covenants\
necessary for salvation\
4:21\
and exaltation.\
4:24\
They set forth not only the essentials\
required to establish the Church\
4:28\
but also provide profound doctrine that\
allows us to understand the purpose of\
4:34\
life and gives us an eternal\
perspective.\
4:39\
One of the numerous examples of Joseph\
Smith's prophetic role is found in\
4:44\
the 76th section of the Doctrine and\
Covenants.\
4:48\
It is an explicit record of the vision\
of heaven, including kingdoms of\
4:53\
glory, which the Prophet Joseph and\
Sidney Rigdon were blessed to\
4:57\
receive on February 16, 1832.\
5:02\
At the time, the vast majority of\
churches were teaching that\
5:05\
the Savior's Atonement would not provide\
salvation for most people.\
5:10\
It was believed that a few would be\
saved and the vast majority would be\
5:15\
doomed to hell and damnation, including\
endless tortures of the most awful\
5:20\
and unspeakable intensity.\
5:23\
The revelation contained in the 76th\
section provides a glorious vision of\
5:28\
the degrees of glory, where the vast\
majority of Heavenly Father's children\
5:33\
who were valiant in their premortal\
estate are profoundly blessed following\
5:38\
the ultimate judgment.\
5:41\
The vision of the three degrees of\
glory, the lowest of which "surpasses\
5:45\
all understanding," is a direct\
refutation of the then- strong\
5:51\
but erroneous doctrine that the majority\
would be doomed to hell\
5:55\
and damnation.\
5:57\
When you realize Joseph Smith was only\
26 years old, had a limited\
6:01\
education, and little or no exposure to\
the classical languages from which\
6:06\
the Bible was translated, he was truly\
an instrument in the Lord's hands.\
6:12\
In the 17th verse of section 76, he was\
inspired to use the word\
6:18\
unjust instead of damnation that was\
used in the Gospel of John.\
6:24\
It is interesting that 45 years later,\
an Anglican Church leader\
6:28\
and academically credentialed classical\
scholar Frederic W Farrar, who wrote\
6:33\
The Life of Christ, asserted that the\
definition of damnation in\
6:38\
the King James version of the Bible was\
the result of translation errors from\
6:43\
Hebrew and Greek to English.\
6:46\
In our day, many have adopted the\
concept that there should be no\
6:52\
consequence for sin.\
6:54\
They support the unconditional condoning\
of sin without repentance.\
7:00\
Our revealed doctrine not only refutes\
the idea that most people would be\
7:05\
eternally condemned to hell and\
damnation but also establishes that\
7:10\
personal repentance is a commanded\
prerequisite to partake of\
7:15\
the Savior's Atonement and inherit the\
celestial kingdom.\
7:20\
I testify that Joseph Smith was truly an\
instrument in the Lord's hands in\
7:25\
bringing forth the Restoration of His\
gospel.\
7:30\
Because of the Restoration of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ,\
7:33\
we understand the importance\
of both repentance\
7:36\
and the works of righteousness.\
7:39\
We understand the overwhelming\
significance of the Savior's Atonement\
7:43\
and of His saving ordinances and\
covenants, including those\
7:47\
performed in the temple.\
7:50\
The works of righteousness emanate from\
and are the fruits of conversion.\
7:55\
True conversion is brought about by the\
conscious acceptance\
7:59\
and commitment to follow the will of\
God.\
8:03\
The banquet of consequences and\
blessings that flow from conversion\
8:07\
are true and permanent peace and the\
personal assurance of ultimate\
8:13\
happiness despite the storms of this\
life.\
8:17\
Conversion to the Savior changes a\
natural man into a\
8:22\
sanctified, born again, purified\
person-a new creature in Christ Jesus.\
8:29\
What are the obligations that flow from\
conversion?\
8:34\
In Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph\
noted that many "are only kept from\
8:39\
the truth because they know not where to\
find it." In the Lord's preface to\
8:43\
the Doctrine and Covenants, a big\
picture declaration of the Lord's\
8:47\
purpose for us was set forth.\
8:50\
He declared, "Wherefore I the Lord,\
knowing the calamity which should\
8:55\
come upon the inhabitants of the earth,\
called upon my servant\
8:58\
Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him\
from heaven, and gave him\
9:03\
commandments." He further instructs,\
"That the fullness of my\
9:07\
gospel might be proclaimed by the weak\
and the simple unto the ends of\
9:13\
the world." That includes full-time\
missionaries.\
9:17\
That includes each of us.\
9:19\
This should be a laser-like focus to\
everyone who has been blessed with\
9:24\
a conversion to the will of God.\
9:28\
The Savior graciously invites us to be\
His voice and His hands.\
9:33\
The love of the Savior will be our\
guiding light.\
9:36\
The Savior taught His disciples, "Go ye\
therefore, and teach\
9:40\
all nations." And to Joseph Smith, he\
declared, "Preach my gospel\
9:45\
unto every creature who has not received\
it." One week after\
9:50\
the dedication of the Kirtland Temple,\
on April 3, 1836-which was\
9:56\
Easter Sunday and also Passover- the\
Lord appeared in the magnificent\
10:01\
vision to Joseph and Oliver Cowdery.\
10:04\
The Lord accepted the temple and\
declared, "This is the beginning of\
10:09\
the blessing which shall be poured out\
upon the heads of my people." After\
10:14\
this vision closed, Moses appeared\
“and committed...\
10:18\
the keys of the gathering of Israel from\
the four parts of the\
10:21\
earth, and the leading of the ten tribes\
from the land of the north."\
10:26\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
10:28\
our beloved prophet today, who\
holds these same\
10:32\
keys, taught this morning, "You young\
men have been reserved for this time\
10:39\
when the promised gathering of Israel is\
taking place.\
10:42\
As you serve missions, you play a\
pivotal role in\
10:48\
this unprecedented event!"\
10:51\
For the Savior's mandate to share the\
gospel to become part of who we\
10:55\
are, we need to become converted to the\
will of God.\
11:00\
We need to love our neighbors, share the\
restored gospel of Jesus\
11:04\
Christ, and invite all to come and see.\
11:09\
As members of the Church, we cherish the\
Prophet Joseph's reply to John\
11:14\
Wentworth, the editor of the Chicago\
Democrat, in 1842.\
11:18\
He was requesting information about the\
Church.\
11:22\
Joseph concluded his response by using\
the standard of truth as a preface to\
11:27\
the 13 Articles of Faith.\
11:30\
The standard conveys in a concise way\
what must be accomplished: "No\
11:36\
unhallowed hand can stop the work from\
progressing; persecutions may\
11:40\
rage, mobs may combine, armies may\
assemble, calumny may defame, but\
11:47\
the truth of God will go forth boldly,\
nobly, and\
11:51\
independent, till it has penetrated\
every continent, visited every\
11:56\
climb, swept every country, and sounded\
in every ear; till\
12:01\
the purposes of God shall be\
accomplished, and the Great Jehovah\
12:06\
shall say the work is done." This has\
been the clarion call for generations\
12:12\
of Latter-day Saints, especially\
missionaries.\
12:16\
In the spirit of the standard of truth,\
we are grateful that in\
12:20\
the midst of a worldwide pandemic,\
faithful missionaries have\
12:24\
shared the gospel.\
12:26\
Missionaries, we love you.\
12:29\
The Lord asks each one of us to share\
His gospel in word and deed.\
12:33\
Our personal conversion includes the\
responsibility to share the gospel\
12:38\
of Jesus Christ with the world.\
12:41\
The blessings of sharing the gospel\
include increasing our conversion to\
12:46\
the will of God and letting God prevail\
in our lives.\
12:51\
We bless others to experience a mighty\
change of heart.\
12:55\
There is truly eternal joy in helping to\
bring souls unto Christ.\
13:01\
Laboring for the conversion of oneself\
and others is the noble task.\
13:08\
I so testify in the name of Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
