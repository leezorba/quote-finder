Thank you, President Nelson,\
for sharing again that counsel\
0:05\
regarding missionary service.\
0:09\
Brothers and sisters, several years ago,\
while speaking in general\
0:15\
conference, the sight in my left eye was\
suddenly compromised by something\
0:22\
called macular degeneration, which\
subsequently worsened and has left me\
0:31\
without useful vision in that eye.\
0:35\
As I have dealt with this challenge,\
I’m ever more thankful\
0:40\
for other kinds of vision,\
including hindsight vision.\
0:47\
As I've looked back over my life, I've\
been able to see certain\
0:52\
experiences that made a\
significant difference.\
0:57\
One of those experiences is how my\
full-time missionary service as\
1:03\
a young man in England blessed my life\
and shaped my spiritual destiny.\
1:12\
I've reflected on how the economic\
challenges associated with the Great\
1:19\
Depression in the 1930s led to an\
unfortunate turn\
1:27\
for my parents and our family.\
1:32\
My father became so involved in saving\
his automobile dealership\
1:38\
and supporting a family during this\
difficult period that for a time my\
1:45\
parents did not attend church.\
1:49\
Although we did not attend church\
services as a family, that did not\
1:55\
prevent me from attending\
occasionally with my friends.\
2:01\
In those days, going on a mission was in\
the back of my mind, but it wasn't\
2:09\
something I talked about with my\
parents.\
2:14\
While attending college, several friends\
and I decided to serve missions.\
2:21\
Visiting with my bishop, I filled out my\
missionary application while my\
2:27\
parents were out of town.\
2:30\
When my parents returned, I surprised\
them with the news that I had been\
2:39\
called to serve in Great Britain.\
2:43\
I'm grateful for their enthusiastic\
support, and for the good friends who\
2:53\
helped me decide to serve.\
2:57\
My missionary service prepared me to be\
a better husband and father and to be\
3:06\
successful in business.\
3:09\
It also prepared me for\
a lifetime of service\
3:17\
in the Lord's Church.\
3:21\
In the April 1985 general conference, I\
was assigned to speak in\
3:28\
the priesthood session.\
3:31\
I directed my remarks to the young men.\
3:36\
I spoke about preparing to\
3:43\
serve a mission.\
3:45\
I said, "Of all the training I have\
received in my Church\
3:51\
assignments, none has been more\
important to me than the training\
3:58\
I received as a 19-year-old elder\
serving a full time mission."\
4:07\
The Lord knows you.\
4:10\
When you are serving your mission, you\
will have experiences that\
4:17\
will help you come to know Him better.\
4:23\
You'll grow spiritually in serving Him.\
4:27\
In His name, you'll be sent on errands\
to serve others.\
4:34\
He will give you experiences with\
promptings of the Holy Ghost.\
4:40\
The Lord will authorize you to teach in\
His name.\
4:47\
You can show Him that He can trust you\
and can rely on you.\
4:56\
Just over five months ago, Elder Jeffrey\
R.\
4:59\
Holland and Elder Quentin L.\
5:01\
Cook, who had also served as\
missionaries in the British\
5:07\
Isles, joined me in visiting with\
members and missionaries in that\
5:14\
beautiful land.\
5:17\
I reflected on my experiences as a young\
missionary.\
5:23\
I testify that my mission is where I\
came to know that Heavenly Father\
5:32\
and my Savior Jesus Christ know and love\
me.\
5:38\
I was blessed to have two wonderful\
mission presidents, Selvoy J.\
5:45\
Boyer and Stainer Richards, along with\
their dedicated companions, Gladys\
5:54\
Boyer and Jane Richards.\
5:58\
I look back, I can see even more clearly\
that they trusted me and loved me.\
6:10\
They taught me the gospel.\
6:13\
They expected a lot from me.\
6:16\
They gave me many challenging\
assignments and leadership\
6:19\
responsibilities to help me grow and\
prepare for a life of service.\
6:27\
I've also reflected on being called by\
President Spencer W.\
6:32\
Kimball to preside over the Canada\
Toronto Mission with my dear\
6:38\
wife, Barbara, and our children at our\
sides.\
6:44\
President Kimball called us to serve in\
April 1974,\
6:51\
shortly after he gave his\
6:54\
inspired missionary message titled “When\
the World Will Be Converted.”\
7:04\
In that message, President Kimball\
explained his vision for how\
7:09\
the gospel would be taken to all the\
world.\
7:14\
He called for many more missionaries\
from around the world.\
7:19\
He reminded us of the Lord's expectation\
"that every man\
7:26\
should...lift a warning voice onto the\
inhabitants of the earth."\
7:34\
President Kimball's teaching about the\
expectation for young men to serve\
7:42\
a mission became a topic of conversation\
in homes all around\
7:48\
the world.\
7:50\
That expectation has not changed.\
7:54\
I’m grateful that President Nelson also\
8:00\
reaffirmed the Lord's expectation this\
morning.\
8:07\
It has been almost 10 years since\
President Thomas S.\
8:14\
Monson announced the lowering of the\
missionary age for young men\
8:20\
and young women.\
8:22\
In my view, a primary reason for this\
change was to give our youth\
8:32\
the life-changing opportunity to serve\
as a missionary.\
8:39\
As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ.\
8:43\
I call upon you, young men, and those\
young women who desire to serve\
8:49\
a mission, to begin right now to talk\
with your parents about serving\
8:57\
a mission.\
8:58\
I also invite you to talk with your\
friends about serving a mission and if\
9:06\
one of your friends is not sure about\
serving,\
9:10\
encourage him to talk with his bishop.\
9:18\
Commit to yourselves and to your\
Heavenly Father that you will serve\
9:26\
a mission and that from this time\
forward you will strive to keep your\
9:33\
hearts, hands, and minds clean and\
unworthy.\
9:40\
I invite you to gain a solid testimony\
of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.\
9:51\
Fathers and mothers of these wonderful\
youth, you have a vital role in this\
9:58\
preparation process.\
10:01\
Begin today to talk with your children\
about missionary service.\
10:08\
We know that the family is the most\
profound influence in building our\
10:15\
young men and young women to prepare.\
10:21\
If you are still the age range for\
missionary service but have not\
10:27\
served yet due to the pandemic \
or other reasons,\
10:33\
I invite you to serve now.\
10:39\
Talk to your bishop and prepare to serve\
the Lord.\
10:46\
I encourage you bishops to help all\
young men and young women who are close\
10:53\
to missionary age to prepare to serve.\
10:58\
And I also encourage you bishops to\
identify those who are old enough\
11:05\
but who have not yet served.\
11:08\
Invite each young man to become a\
missionary, as well as each young\
11:16\
woman who desires to serve.\
11:21\
To the missionaries currently serving,\
thank you.\
11:28\
Your mission has been during a worldwide\
pandemic.\
11:35\
As a result, your mission\
experience has been\
11:38\
unlike my missionary experience\
11:42\
or the missionary experience of\
missionaries who served prior to 2020.\
11:50\
I know it has not been easy.\
11:54\
But even during these difficult times,\
the Lord has had a work for you\
12:00\
to do, and you have done it wonderfully\
well.\
12:06\
For example, you have used technology\
12:12\
and new ways to find those who are ready\
12:18\
to learn about the Restoration of\
12:23\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
12:26\
As you have served diligently and\
according to your\
12:30\
abilities, I know that the Lord is\
pleased with your effort.\
12:36\
I know that your service will bless your\
life.\
12:42\
When you're released from your mission,\
remember that you are not\
12:47\
released from activity in the Church.\
12:51\
Build upon the good habits you learned\
on your mission, continue to strengthen\
12:58\
your testimony, work hard, pray, and be\
obedient to the Lord.\
13:06\
Honor the covenants you have made.\
13:09\
Continue to bless and serve others.\
13:14\
I pray that you, young men and the young\
women and your parents will\
13:21\
see and know how missionary service will\
bless forever your life.\
13:31\
May you know in your minds and feel in\
your hearts the power of\
13:40\
the invitation of the Lord that He gave\
to the great missionary sons of Mosiah.\
13:50\
He said, “Go forth... \
and establish my word;\
13:59\
yet ye shall be patient in long-\
14:03\
suffering and afflictions, that ye may\
show forth good examples...\
14:10\
in me, and I will make an instrument\
of thee in my hands\
14:19\
unto the salvation of many souls.”\
14:24\
May God bless the youth of\
the Church to desire to prepare\
14:31\
and serve Him is my humble prayer, which\
I offer this morning in\
14:39\
the sacred name of the Lord Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
