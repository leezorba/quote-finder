My dear brothers and sisters, I love\
you.\
0:07\
I cherish this opportunity to speak with\
you today.\
0:12\
I pray daily that you will be protected\
from the fierce attacks of\
0:17\
the adversary and have the strength to\
push forward through whatever\
0:23\
challenges you face.\
0:26\
Some trials are deeply private burdens\
no one else can see.\
0:33\
Others are played out on the world\
stage.\
0:38\
The armed conflict in Eastern Europe is\
one of these.\
0:43\
I have been to Ukraine and Russia many\
times.\
0:48\
I love those lands, the people, and\
their languages.\
0:53\
I weep and pray for all who are affected\
by this conflict.\
1:00\
As a Church, we're doing all we can to\
help those who are suffering\
1:06\
and struggling to survive.\
1:09\
We invite everyone to continue to fast\
and pray for all the people being hurt\
1:14\
by this calamity.\
1:17\
Any war is a horrifying violation of\
everything the Lord Jesus Christ stands\
1:26\
for and teaches.\
1:30\
None of us can control nations or the\
actions of others, or even members\
1:36\
of our own families.\
1:39\
But we can control ourselves.\
1:44\
My call today, dear brothers and\
sisters, is to end conflicts that\
1:49\
are raging in your heart, your home, and\
your life.\
1:58\
Bury any and all inclination to hurt\
others-whether those inclinations be\
2:07\
a temper, a sharp tongue, or a\
resentment for someone who has hurt you.\
2:16\
The Savior commanded us to turn the\
other cheek, to love our\
2:21\
enemies, and to pray for those who\
despitefully use us.\
2:29\
It can be painfully difficult to let go\
of anger that feels so justified.\
2:35\
It can seem impossible to forgive those\
whose destructive actions have hurt\
2:40\
the innocent.\
2:43\
And yet the Savior admonished us "to\
forgive all men."\
2:50\
We are followers of the Prince of Peace.\
2:54\
Now more than ever, we need the peace\
only He can bring.\
3:04\
How can we expect peace to exist in the\
world when we are not individually\
3:08\
seeking peace and harmony?\
3:12\
Brothers and sisters, I know what I'm\
suggesting is not easy, but followers\
3:16\
of Jesus Christ should set the example\
for all the world to follow.\
3:23\
I plead with you to do all you can to\
end personal conflicts that are\
3:27\
currently raging in your hearts and in\
your lives.\
3:33\
May I underscore this call to action by\
discussing a concept I was reminded of\
3:39\
recently while watching a basketball\
game.\
3:46\
In that game, the first half was a\
seesaw battle back and forth.\
3:53\
Then, during the last 5 seconds of the\
first half, a guard on one team\
3:57\
made a beautiful three-point shot.\
4:02\
With only one second left, his teammate\
stole the inbound pass and made another\
4:08\
basket at the buzzer.\
4:11\
So that team went into the locker room\
four points ahead with a palpable surge\
4:17\
of momentum.\
4:21\
They were able to carry that momentum\
into the second half and win the game.\
4:27\
Momentum is a powerful concept.\
4:33\
We all have experienced it in one form\
or another-\
4:38\
for example, in a vehicle that picks up\
speed or with a disagreement that\
4:43\
suddenly turns into an argument.\
4:46\
So I ask, "What can ignite spiritual\
momentum?"\
4:54\
We've seen examples of both positive and\
negative momentum.\
4:59\
We know followers of Jesus Christ\
5:01\
who became converted and\
5:02\
grew in their faith.\
5:04\
But we also know of once committed\
believers who fell away.\
5:08\
Momentum can swing either way.\
5:11\
We have never needed positive spiritual\
momentum more than we do now, to\
5:18\
counteract the speed with which evil and\
5:21\
the darker signs of times are\
intensifying.\
5:26\
Positive spiritual momentum will keep us\
moving forward amid the fear\
5:31\
and uncertainty created by pandemics,\
tsunamis, volcanic\
5:36\
eruptions, and armed hostilities.\
5:40\
Spiritual momentum can help us withstand\
the relentless, wicked\
5:46\
attacks of the adversary and thwart his\
efforts to erode our personal,\
5:52\
spiritual foundation.\
5:57\
Many actions can ignite positive\
spiritual momentum.\
6:04\
Obedience, love, humility, service, and\
gratitude are but a few.\
6:13\
Today, I would like to suggest five\
specific actions we can take to help us\
6:20\
maintain positive spiritual momentum.\
6:25\
First, get on the covenant path and stay\
there.\
6:32\
Not long ago, I had a vivid dream in\
which I met a large group of people.\
6:37\
They asked me many questions, most\
frequent of which was about\
6:41\
the covenant path and why is it so\
important?\
6:46\
In my dream, I explained that we entered\
the covenant path by being\
6:51\
baptized and by making our first\
covenant with God.\
6:56\
Each time we partake of the sacrament,\
we promise again to take\
7:01\
the name of the Savior upon us to\
remember Him and keep His commandments.\
7:06\
In return, God assures us that we may\
always have the Spirit of the Lord to\
7:13\
be with us.\
7:16\
Later, we make additional covenants in\
the temple where we receive even\
7:19\
greater promises.\
7:22\
Ordinances and covenants give us access\
to godly power.\
7:28\
The covenant path is the only path that\
leads to exaltation and eternal life.\
7:35\
Well, in my dream, a woman then asked\
how someone who has broken their\
7:40\
covenants can get back on the path.\
7:45\
My answer to her question leads to my\
second suggestion: Discover the joy of\
7:53\
daily repentance.\
7:56\
How important is repentance?\
8:00\
Alma taught that we should "preach\
nothing save it were repentance\
8:03\
and faith on the Lord." Repentance is\
required of every accountable person\
8:10\
who desires eternal glory.\
8:14\
There are no exceptions.\
8:17\
In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph\
Smith, the Lord chastised early Church\
8:22\
leaders for not teaching the gospel to\
their children.\
8:27\
Repenting is the key to progress.\
8:31\
Pure faith keeps us moving forward on\
the covenant path.\
8:36\
Please do not fear or delay repenting.\
8:40\
Satan delights in your misery.\
8:43\
Cut it short.\
8:46\
Cast his influence out of your life.\
8:50\
Start today to experience the joy of\
putting off the natural man.\
8:56\
The Savior loves us always, but\
especially when we repent.\
9:03\
He promised that though "the mountains\
shall depart, and the hills be\
9:08\
removed; ...my kindness shall not depart\
from thee."\
9:15\
If you feel you have strayed off the\
covenant path too far or too long\
9:19\
and have no way to return, that simply\
is not true.\
9:24\
Please contact your bishop or branch\
president.\
9:27\
He is the Lordâ€™s agent and will help you\
experience\
9:30\
the joy and relief of repenting.\
9:35\
Now, a caution.\
9:39\
Returning to the covenant path does not\
mean that life will be easy.\
9:46\
This path is rigorous and at times will\
feel like a steep climb.\
9:52\
This ascent, however, is designed to\
test and teach us, to refine our\
9:58\
natures, and help us to become Saints.\
10:02\
It is the only path that leads to\
exaltation.\
10:07\
One prophet described the blessed and\
happy state of those that keep\
10:10\
the commandments of God: "For behold,\
they are blessed in all\
10:14\
things, both temporal and spiritual; and\
if they hold out\
10:19\
faithful to the end they are received\
into heaven...\
10:21\
[and] dwell with God in a state of\
never-ending happiness."\
10:30\
Walking the covenant path, coupled with\
daily repentance, fuels positive\
10:35\
spiritual momentum.\
10:40\
My third suggestion: Learn about God and\
how He works.\
10:48\
One of our greatest challenges today is\
distinguishing between the truths of\
10:52\
God and the counterfeits of Satan.\
10:57\
This is why the Lord warned us to "pray\
always,...that [we] may conquer\
11:03\
Satan, and...escape the hands of the\
servants of Satan that do uphold\
11:09\
his work."\
11:12\
Moses provided an example of how to\
discern between God and Satan.\
11:19\
When Satan came tempting Moses,\
11:24\
he detected the deception because he had\
just had a face-to-face interaction\
11:29\
with God.\
11:31\
Moses quickly realized who Satan was and\
commanded him to depart.\
11:38\
When Satan persisted, Moses knew how to\
call upon God for more help.\
11:44\
Moses received divine strength and\
rebuked the evil one\
11:48\
again, saying, "Depart from me, Satan,\
for this one God only will\
11:54\
I worship." We should follow that\
example.\
11:59\
Cast Satan's influence out of your life.\
12:03\
Please do not follow him down to his\
"gulf of misery and endless wo." With\
12:10\
frightening speed, a testimony that is\
not nourished daily "by the good word\
12:16\
of God" can crumble.\
12:20\
Thus the antidote to Satan's scheme is\
clear.\
12:26\
We need daily experiences worshipping\
the Lord and studying His gospel.\
12:31\
I plead with you to let God prevail in\
your life.\
12:36\
Give Him a fair share of your time.\
12:39\
As you do, notice what happens to your\
positive spiritual momentum.\
12:47\
Suggestion number four: Seek and expect\
miracles.\
12:54\
Moroni assured us that "God has not\
ceased to be a God of miracles." Every\
13:00\
book of scripture demonstrates how\
willing the Lord is to intervene in\
13:04\
the lives of those who believe in Him.\
13:08\
He parted the Red Sea for Moses, helped\
Nephi retrieve the brass\
13:14\
plates, and restored the Church through\
the Prophet Joseph Smith.\
13:19\
Each of these miracles took time and may\
not have been exactly what\
13:25\
those individuals originally requested\
from the Lord.\
13:31\
In the same way, the Lord will bless you\
with miracles if you believe in\
13:38\
Him, "doubting nothing." Do the\
spiritual work to seek miracles.\
13:45\
Prayerfully ask God to help you exercise\
that kind of faith.\
13:52\
I promise that you can experience for\
yourself that Jesus Christ "giveth\
13:57\
power to the faint; and to them that\
have no might, he increaseth strength."\
14:06\
Few things will accelerate your\
spiritual momentum more than realizing\
14:12\
the Lord is helping you to move a\
mountain in your life.\
14:18\
Suggestion number five: End conflict in\
your personal life.\
14:27\
I repeat my call to end the conflicts in\
your life.\
14:32\
Exercise the humility, courage, and\
strength required both to\
14:37\
forgive and to seek forgiveness.\
14:42\
The Savior has promised that if we\
forgive men their trespasses, our\
14:47\
Heavenly Father will also forgive us.\
14:54\
Two weeks from today, we celebrate\
Easter.\
14:58\
Between now and then, I invite you to\
seek an end to a personal conflict that\
15:03\
has weighed you down.\
15:06\
Could there be a more fitting act of\
gratitude\
15:09\
to Jesus Christ for His\
Atonement?\
15:12\
If forgiveness presently seems\
impossible, plead for power through\
15:16\
the atoning blood of Jesus Christ to\
help you.\
15:21\
As you do so, I promise a personal peace\
and a burst of spiritual momentum.\
15:32\
When the Savior atoned for all mankind,\
He opened a way that those who\
15:37\
follow Him can have access to His\
healing,\
15:41\
strengthening, and redeeming\
power.\
15:46\
These spiritual privileges are available\
to all who seek to hear Him\
15:52\
and follow Him.\
15:55\
My dear brothers and sisters, with all\
the pleadings of my heart, I urge you\
16:00\
to get on the covenant path and stay\
there.\
16:06\
Experience the joy of repenting daily.\
16:10\
Learn about God and how He works.\
16:13\
Seek and expect miracles.\
16:17\
Strive to end conflict in your life.\
16:22\
As you act on these pursuits, I promise\
you the ability to move\
16:27\
forward on the covenant path with\
increased momentum despite whatever\
16:32\
obstacles you face.\
16:35\
And I promise you greater strength to\
resist temptation, more peace of\
16:40\
mind, freedom from fear, and greater\
unity in your families.\
16:48\
God lives.\
16:50\
Jesus is the Christ.\
16:52\
He lives.\
16:54\
He loves us and will help us.\
16:56\
Of this I testify in the sacred name of\
our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, amen.\
