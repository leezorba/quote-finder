For her entire life,\
my wife, Melinda,\
0:03\
has tried with all her heart to\
be a faithful disciple of Jesus\
0:08\
Christ.\
0:09\
Yet, beginning in\
her youth, she felt\
0:11\
unworthy of Heavenly\
Father's love and blessings\
0:14\
because she\
misunderstood His nature.\
0:17\
Fortunately, Melinda continued\
to keep the commandments\
0:20\
in spite of the sadness\
she felt. A few years ago,\
0:23\
she had a series\
of experiences that\
0:26\
helped her better understand\
God's nature, including\
0:31\
His love for His children\
and His gratitude\
0:34\
for our even-imperfect\
efforts to do His work.\
0:39\
She explains how this\
has influenced her:\
0:43\
"I now feel sure that\
the Father's plan works,\
0:47\
that He is personally\
invested in our success,\
0:50\
and that He provides\
us with the lessons\
0:52\
and experiences we need\
to return to His presence.\
0:56\
I see myself and others\
more as God sees us.\
1:00\
I am able to parent,\
teach, and serve\
1:03\
with more love and less fear.\
1:05\
I feel peace and\
confidence rather than\
1:08\
anxiety and insecurity.\
1:10\
Instead of feeling\
judged, I feel supported.\
1:13\
My faith is more certain.\
1:15\
I feel my Father's love\
more often and more deeply."\
1:22\
Having "a correct idea of\
[Heavenly Father's] character,\
1:25\
perfections, and attributes"\
is essential to exercising\
1:29\
faith sufficient to\
obtain exaltation.\
1:32\
A correct understanding of\
Heavenly Father's character\
1:35\
can change how we see\
ourselves and others\
1:38\
and help us to understand\
God's tremendous love\
1:41\
for His children\
and His great desire\
1:43\
to help us become like Him.\
1:46\
An incorrect view\
of His nature can\
1:48\
leave us feeling as if we are\
incapable of ever making it\
1:52\
back to His presence.\
1:55\
My objective today is to\
teach key doctrinal points\
1:58\
about the Father that\
will allow each of us,\
2:01\
but especially those who wonder\
if God loves them, to better\
2:06\
understand His true character\
and to exercise greater faith\
2:10\
in Him, His Son,\
and His plan for us.\
2:16\
In the premortal world,\
we were born as spirits\
2:18\
to Heavenly Parents and\
lived with Them as a family.\
2:22\
They knew us, taught\
us, and loved us.\
2:25\
We wanted very much to be\
like our Heavenly Father.\
2:29\
However, to do so, we recognized\
that we would have to:\
2:32\
1.\
2:33\
Obtain glorified,\
immortal, physical bodies;\
2:37\
2.\
2:38\
Be married and form families\
by the sealing power\
2:41\
of the priesthood; and\
2:43\
3.\
2:44\
Acquire all knowledge,\
power, and divine attributes.\
2:48\
Consequently, the\
Father created a plan\
2:50\
that would allow us,\
upon certain conditions,\
2:53\
to obtain physical\
bodies that would become\
2:56\
immortal and glorified in the\
Resurrection; marry and form\
3:00\
families in mortality or, for\
the faithful who did not have\
3:04\
this opportunity,\
after mortality;\
3:07\
progress towards\
perfection; and ultimately\
3:10\
return to our Heavenly\
Parents and live with Them\
3:13\
and our families in\
a state of exaltation\
3:17\
and eternal happiness.\
3:19\
The scriptures call this\
the plan of salvation.\
3:22\
We were so grateful\
for this plan\
3:24\
that when it was presented\
to us, we shouted for joy.\
3:28\
Each of us accepted the\
conditions of the plan,\
3:31\
including the experiences\
and challenges of mortality\
3:35\
that would help us\
develop divine attributes.\
3:39\
During mortality,\
Heavenly Father\
3:41\
provides us with the\
conditions we need\
3:43\
to progress within His plan.\
3:45\
The Father begot Jesus\
Christ in the flesh\
3:48\
and provided Him\
with divine help\
3:50\
to fulfill His mortal mission.\
3:52\
Heavenly Father will\
likewise help each of us\
3:55\
if we will strive to\
keep His commandments.\
3:58\
The Father gives us agency.\
4:01\
Our lives are in His\
hands, and our "days\
4:03\
are known" and "shall\
not be numbered less."\
4:06\
And He ensures that\
eventually all things\
4:09\
work for the good of\
those who love Him.\
4:13\
It is Heavenly Father who\
gives us our daily bread, which\
4:16\
includes both the food we\
eat and the strength we\
4:20\
need to keep His commandments.\
4:22\
The Father gives good gifts.\
4:24\
He hears and\
answers our prayers.\
4:27\
Heavenly Father delivers us\
from evil when we let Him.\
4:30\
He weeps for us when we suffer.\
4:33\
Ultimately, all of our\
blessings come from the Father.\
4:37\
Heavenly Father\
guides us and gives us\
4:39\
the experiences we need based\
on our strengths, weaknesses,\
4:44\
and choices so that we\
might bear good fruit.\
4:47\
The Father chastens us when\
necessary because He loves us.\
4:51\
He is a "Man of Counsel," who\
will counsel with us if we ask.\
4:55\
It is Heavenly Father who\
sends both the influence\
4:58\
and the gift of the Holy\
Ghost into our lives.\
5:01\
Through the gift\
of the Holy Ghost,\
5:03\
the glory--or\
intelligence, light,\
5:05\
and power--of the\
Father can dwell in us.\
5:09\
If we will strive to increase in\
light and truth until our eyes\
5:12\
become single to God's glory,\
Heavenly Father will send\
5:16\
the Holy Spirit of Promise to\
seal us up unto eternal life\
5:19\
and reveal His face unto\
us--either in this life\
5:23\
or the next.\
5:25\
In the postmortal spirit\
world, Heavenly Father\
5:28\
continues to shed\
forth the Holy Ghost\
5:30\
and send missionaries to\
those who need the gospel.\
5:33\
He answers prayers\
and helps those\
5:35\
who lack them receive\
vicarious saving ordinances.\
5:39\
The Father raised\
up Jesus Christ\
5:41\
and gave Him power to bring to\
pass the Resurrection, which\
5:44\
is the means by which we\
obtain immortal bodies.\
5:48\
The Savior's Redemption\
and Resurrection\
5:50\
bring us back into the\
presence of the Father,\
5:53\
where we will be\
judged by Jesus Christ.\
5:56\
Those who rely upon "the\
merits, and mercy, and grace\
5:59\
of the Holy Messiah" will\
receive glorified bodies\
6:03\
like the Father\
and dwell with Him\
6:05\
"in a state of\
never-ending happiness."\
6:08\
There, the Father will\
wipe away all our tears\
6:11\
and help us continue on our\
journey to become like Him.\
6:15\
As you can see, Heavenly\
Father is always there for us.\
6:20\
To become like the\
Father, we must\
6:23\
develop His character traits.\
6:24\
Heavenly Father's\
perfections and attributes\
6:27\
include the following:\
6:29\
The Father is\
"Endless and Eternal."\
6:31\
He is perfectly just,\
merciful, kind, long-suffering,\
6:37\
and wants only what\
is best for us.\
6:39\
Heavenly Father is love.\
6:41\
He keeps His covenants.\
6:43\
He does not change.\
6:44\
He cannot lie.\
6:46\
The Father is no\
respecter of persons.\
6:49\
He knows all\
things--past, present,\
6:51\
and future--from the beginning.\
6:54\
Heavenly Father is more\
intelligent than us all.\
6:58\
The Father has\
all power and does\
7:00\
all that He takes\
into His heart to do.\
7:03\
Brothers and sisters,\
we can trust in\
7:05\
and rely upon the Father.\
7:10\
Because He has an\
eternal perspective,\
7:12\
Heavenly Father can\
see things we cannot.\
7:14\
His joy, work, and glory are to\
bring to pass our immortality\
7:19\
and exaltation.\
7:21\
Everything He does\
is for our benefit.\
7:24\
He "wants [our]\
eternal happiness\
7:27\
even more than [we] do."\
7:28\
And He "would not require\
[us] to experience\
7:31\
a moment more of difficulty\
than is absolutely needed\
7:34\
for [our] benefit or for\
that of those [we] love."\
7:38\
As a result, He focuses\
on helping us to progress,\
7:42\
not on judging\
and condemning us.\
7:45\
As spirit sons and\
daughters of God, each of us\
7:48\
has the potential to\
become like the Father.\
7:51\
To do so, we must worship the\
Father in the name of the Son.\
7:54\
We do this by striving to\
be obedient to the will\
7:57\
of the Father, as\
the Savior was,\
7:59\
and by continually repenting.\
8:02\
As we do these things, we\
"receive grace for grace"\
8:05\
until we receive of\
the Father's fulness\
8:08\
and are endowed\
with "his character,\
8:11\
perfections, and attributes."\
8:13\
Given the distance between\
what we are as mortals\
8:16\
and what Heavenly\
Father has become,\
8:19\
it is not surprising\
that some feel\
8:21\
that becoming like the\
Father is unattainable.\
8:24\
Nevertheless, the\
scriptures are clear.\
8:27\
If we will cleave\
in faith to Christ,\
8:29\
repent, and seek God's\
grace through obedience,\
8:32\
eventually we will\
become like the Father.\
8:36\
I take great comfort\
in the fact that those\
8:39\
who strive to be obedient\
will "receive grace for grace"\
8:44\
and ultimately "receive\
of his fulness."\
8:47\
In other words, we won't become\
like the Father on our own.\
8:51\
Rather, it will come\
through gifts of grace,\
8:54\
some big but mostly small,\
that build upon one another\
8:59\
until we have a fulness.\
9:01\
But brothers and\
sisters, it will come!\
9:05\
I invite you to trust that\
Heavenly Father knows how\
9:07\
to exalt you; seek His\
daily, sustaining help;\
9:11\
and press forward with faith\
in Christ even when you cannot\
9:14\
feel God's love.\
9:16\
There is much we\
do not understand\
9:18\
about becoming like the Father.\
9:20\
But I can testify with\
certainty that striving\
9:24\
to become like the Father\
is worth every sacrifice.\
9:28\
The sacrifices we make here in\
mortality, no matter how great,\
9:32\
are simply incomparable to the\
immeasurable joy, happiness,\
9:36\
and love we will feel\
in God's presence.\
9:38\
If you are struggling to believe\
it is worth the sacrifices you\
9:42\
are asked to make, the\
Savior calls to you, saying,\
9:45\
"Ye have not as yet understood\
how great blessings the Father\
9:50\
hath ... prepared for you; ...\
ye cannot bear all things now;\
9:54\
nevertheless, be of good cheer,\
for I will lead you along."\
9:58\
I testify that your Heavenly\
Father loves you and wants\
10:02\
you to live with Him again.\
10:03\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
