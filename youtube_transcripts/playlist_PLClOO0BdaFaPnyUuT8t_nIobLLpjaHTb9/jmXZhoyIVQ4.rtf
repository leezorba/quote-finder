My beloved sisters, it is\
wonderful to meet with you.\
0:06\
This is an exciting time in\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
0:11\
of Latter-day Saints.\
0:13\
The Lord is pouring\
out knowledge\
0:16\
on His Church as He\
promised that He would.\
0:21\
You remember what He said: "How\
long can rolling waters remain\
0:25\
impure?\
0:26\
What power shall\
stay the heavens?\
0:29\
As well [man might]\
stretch forth his puny arm\
0:32\
to stop the Missouri river\
in its decreed course,\
0:36\
or to turn it up stream,\
as to hinder the Almighty\
0:41\
from pouring down\
knowledge from heaven\
0:45\
upon the heads of the\
Latter-day Saints."\
0:49\
Part of the Lord's current\
sharing of knowledge\
0:54\
relates to accelerating\
His pouring out\
0:58\
eternal truth on the heads and\
into the hearts of His people.\
1:04\
He has made clear that the\
daughters of Heavenly Father\
1:10\
will play a primary role in\
that miraculous acceleration.\
1:16\
One evidence of the miracle is\
His leading His living prophet\
1:23\
to put far greater emphasis on\
gospel instruction in the home\
1:29\
and within the family.\
1:33\
Now, you might ask, "How does\
that make faithful sisters\
1:37\
a primary force to\
help the Lord pour out\
1:42\
knowledge on His Saints?"\
1:44\
The Lord gives the answer\
in the family proclamation\
1:49\
to the world.\
1:51\
You remember the words,\
but you may see new meaning\
1:56\
and recognize that the Lord\
foresaw these exciting changes\
2:02\
which are now occurring.\
2:04\
In the proclamation, He\
gave the sisters charge\
2:09\
to be the principal gospel\
educators in the family\
2:13\
in these words:\
"Mothers are primarily\
2:18\
responsible for the\
nurture of their children."\
2:24\
This includes the nurture of\
gospel truth and knowledge.\
2:31\
The proclamation,\
of course, goes on:\
2:33\
"Fathers and mothers\
are obligated to help\
2:36\
one another as equal partners."\
2:41\
They are equal partners,\
equal in their potential\
2:44\
for spiritual growth and\
for acquiring knowledge,\
2:48\
and so are unified by\
helping each other.\
2:52\
They are equal in their divine\
destiny to be exalted together.\
2:59\
In fact, men and women\
cannot be exalted alone.\
3:06\
Why, then, does a daughter\
of God in a united and equal\
3:09\
relationship receive the primary\
responsibility to nourish with\
3:15\
the most important nutrient\
all must receive--a knowledge\
3:20\
of truth coming from heaven?\
3:23\
As nearly as I can see,\
that has been the Lord's way\
3:28\
since families were\
created in this world.\
3:32\
For instance, it was Eve\
who received the knowledge\
3:35\
that Adam needed to partake\
of the fruit of the tree\
3:38\
of knowledge for them to keep\
all of God's commandments\
3:42\
and to form a family.\
3:44\
I do not know why it\
came to Eve first,\
3:48\
but Adam and Eve were perfectly\
united when the knowledge was\
3:52\
poured out on Adam.\
3:54\
Another example of the\
Lord's using the nurturing\
3:57\
gifts of women is the\
way He strengthened\
4:00\
the sons of Helaman.\
4:02\
I get a lump in my throat\
when I read the account\
4:06\
and remember my own mother's\
quiet words of assurance\
4:10\
as I left home for\
military service.\
4:14\
Helaman recorded:\
4:18\
"They had been taught\
by their mothers,\
4:22\
that if they did not doubt,\
God would deliver them.\
4:27\
"And they rehearsed unto me\
the words of their mothers,\
4:30\
saying: We do not doubt\
our mothers knew it."\
4:37\
While I do not know\
all the Lord's reasons\
4:39\
for giving primary\
responsibility for nurturing\
4:42\
in the family to\
faithful sisters,\
4:45\
I believe it has to do\
with your capacity to love.\
4:49\
It takes great love to\
feel the needs of someone\
4:52\
else more than your own.\
4:55\
That is the pure love of Christ\
for the person you nurture.\
5:00\
That feeling of charity\
comes from the person\
5:04\
chosen to be the\
nurturer having qualified\
5:07\
for the effects of the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
5:12\
The motto of the Relief\
Society, which my own mother\
5:16\
exemplified, seems to me\
inspired: "Charity Never\
5:21\
Faileth."\
5:23\
As daughters of God, you have\
an innate and great capacity\
5:28\
to sense the needs of\
others and to love.\
5:32\
That in turn makes you more\
susceptible to the whisperings\
5:37\
of the Spirit.\
5:38\
That Spirit can then guide\
what you think, what you say,\
5:43\
and what you do\
to nurture people\
5:47\
so the Lord may pour knowledge,\
truth, and courage upon them.\
5:55\
You sisters hearing\
my voice tonight\
5:58\
are each in a unique place\
in your journey through life.\
6:01\
Some are young girls in\
a general women's session\
6:05\
for the first time.\
6:07\
Some are young women preparing\
to be the nurturers God\
6:11\
would have them be.\
6:13\
Some are newly married who\
have not yet had children;\
6:17\
others are young mothers\
with one or more.\
6:20\
Some are mothers of\
teenagers and others\
6:23\
with children in\
the mission field.\
6:25\
Some have children who have\
become weakened in faith\
6:29\
and are far from home.\
6:31\
Some live alone with\
no faithful companion.\
6:35\
Some are grandmothers.\
6:38\
Yet whatever your\
personal circumstance,\
6:41\
you are part--a key part--of the\
family of God and of your own\
6:48\
family, whether in the\
future, in this world,\
6:52\
or in the spirit world.\
6:54\
Your trust from\
God is to nurture\
6:58\
as many of His and\
your family members\
7:02\
as you can with your love and\
your faith in the Lord Jesus\
7:07\
Christ.\
7:09\
Your practical challenge\
is to know whom to nurture\
7:13\
and how and when.\
7:15\
Well, you need the Lord's help.\
7:18\
He knows others' hearts,\
and He knows when they are\
7:21\
ready to accept your nurturing.\
7:23\
Your prayer of faith will\
be your key to success.\
7:28\
You can depend upon\
receiving His guidance.\
7:33\
He gave this encouragement:\
"Ask the Father\
7:37\
in my name in faith, believing\
that you shall receive,\
7:40\
and you shall have the Holy\
Ghost, which [will manifest]\
7:44\
all things which are expedient."\
7:49\
In addition to prayer, serious\
study of the scriptures\
7:52\
will be part of your\
growing power to nurture.\
7:56\
Here is the promise:\
"Neither take\
8:02\
ye thought beforehand\
what ye shall say;\
8:05\
but treasure up in your minds\
continually the words of life,\
8:09\
and it shall be given\
you in the very hour\
8:12\
that portion that shall\
be meted unto every man."\
8:20\
So you will take\
more time to pray,\
8:23\
to ponder, and to meditate\
on spiritual matters.\
8:27\
You will have knowledge of\
truth poured out upon you\
8:31\
and grow in your power to\
nurture others in your family.\
8:37\
There will be\
times when you feel\
8:39\
that your progress in learning\
how better to nurture is slow.\
8:43\
It will take faith to endure.\
8:45\
He sent you this encouragement:\
8:49\
"Wherefore, be not\
weary in well-doing,\
8:51\
for ye are laying the\
foundation of a great work.\
8:54\
And out of small things\
proceedeth that which is great.\
8:59\
"Behold, the Lord requireth\
the heart and a willing mind;\
9:05\
and the willing\
and obedient shall\
9:07\
eat the good of the land of\
Zion in these last days."\
9:13\
Your very presence\
tonight is evidence\
9:17\
that you are willing to\
accept the Lord's invitation\
9:20\
to nurture others.\
9:22\
That is true even for the\
youngest here tonight.\
9:26\
You can know whom to\
nurture in your family.\
9:30\
If you pray with real\
intent, a name or a face\
9:34\
will come to your mind.\
9:35\
That could happen tonight.\
9:37\
If you pray to know what\
to do or what to say,\
9:41\
you will feel an answer.\
9:43\
Each time you obey, your\
power to nurture will grow.\
9:49\
You will be\
preparing for the day\
9:51\
when you will nurture\
your own children.\
9:54\
Mothers of teenagers\
could pray to know\
9:56\
how to nurture a son\
or a daughter who seems\
10:00\
unresponsive to your nurturing.\
10:02\
You might ask to\
know who could have\
10:06\
the spiritual influence your\
child needs and would accept.\
10:11\
God hears and answers\
such heartfelt prayers\
10:16\
of worried mothers, and\
so He sends them help.\
10:24\
Also, a grandmother\
here tonight may\
10:27\
feel heartache caused by\
the strains and difficulties\
10:30\
of her children\
and grandchildren.\
10:32\
You might take\
courage and direction\
10:34\
from the experiences of\
families in the scriptures.\
10:38\
From the time of Eve and\
Adam, through Father Israel,\
10:43\
and on to every family\
in the Book of Mormon,\
10:46\
there is one sure\
lesson about what\
10:49\
to do about the sorrows\
of unresponsive children:\
10:53\
never stop loving.\
10:57\
We have the encouraging\
example of the Savior\
11:00\
as He nourished the rebellious\
spirit children of His Heavenly\
11:03\
Father.\
11:04\
Even when they and\
we have caused pain,\
11:08\
the Savior's hand is\
still outstretched.\
11:11\
He spoke in 3 Nephi of His\
spiritual sisters and brothers\
11:15\
whom He had tried unsuccessfully\
to nurture: "O ye people ...\
11:20\
who are of the house of Israel,\
how oft have I gathered you\
11:24\
as a hen gathereth her\
chickens under her wings,\
11:27\
and have nourished you."\
11:30\
For sisters in every\
stage of life's journey,\
11:33\
in every family situation,\
and across every culture,\
11:37\
the Savior is your\
perfect example\
11:40\
of how you will play a\
major part in His move\
11:44\
to place greater emphasis on\
gospel learning in the home\
11:50\
and family.\
11:52\
You will bring your\
inherent feeling of charity\
11:55\
into changes in activities\
and practices in your family.\
11:59\
That will bring greater\
spiritual growth.\
12:02\
When you pray with and\
for family members,\
12:07\
you will feel your and the\
Savior's love for them.\
12:12\
That will become more and\
more your spiritual gift\
12:15\
as you seek it.\
12:16\
Your family members will feel it\
as you pray with greater faith.\
12:21\
When the family gathers\
to read scriptures aloud,\
12:23\
you will already have read\
them and prayed over them\
12:26\
to prepare yourself.\
12:27\
You will have found moments\
to pray for the Spirit\
12:30\
to enlighten your mind.\
12:32\
Then, when it is\
your turn to read,\
12:34\
family members will feel your\
love for God and for His word.\
12:39\
They will be nurtured by\
Him and by His Spirit.\
12:43\
That same outpouring can\
come in any family gathering\
12:46\
if you pray and plan for it.\
12:49\
It may take effort and time,\
but it will bring miracles.\
12:53\
I remember a lesson my mother\
taught when I was little.\
12:56\
I can still see in my\
mind the colored map\
12:59\
she had made of the travels\
of the Apostle Paul.\
13:02\
I wonder how she found the\
time and energy to do that.\
13:06\
And to this day I am\
blessed by her love\
13:08\
for that faithful Apostle as\
I now serve among Apostles.\
13:14\
You will each find\
ways to contribute\
13:16\
to the outpouring of truth upon\
your families in the Lord's\
13:22\
restored Church.\
13:23\
Each of you will pray,\
study, and ponder\
13:26\
to know what your unique\
contribution will be.\
13:29\
But this I know: each of you,\
equally yoked with sons of God,\
13:34\
will be a major part of a\
miracle of gospel learning\
13:37\
and living that will hasten\
the gathering of Israel\
13:41\
and will prepare God's family\
for the glorious return\
13:45\
of the Lord Jesus Christ.\
13:47\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
