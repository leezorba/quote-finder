In speaking of the\
President of The Church\
0:03\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints, the Lord proclaimed:\
0:08\
"And again, the duty of\
the President of the office\
0:11\
of the High Priesthood is to\
preside over the whole church,\
0:16\
and to be like unto Moses--\
0:17\
"...\
0:18\
Yea, to be a seer, a revelator,\
a translator, and a prophet,\
0:23\
having all the gifts\
of God which he bestows\
0:26\
upon the head of the church."\
0:29\
I have been blessed to witness\
some of the gifts of God\
0:32\
upon His prophets.\
0:33\
May I share one such\
sacred experience with you?\
0:37\
Prior to my current calling, I\
assisted in the identification\
0:42\
and recommending of\
future temple sites.\
0:45\
After September 11, 2001,\
crossings along the U.S.\
0:50\
borders became more controlled.\
0:52\
As a result, it took two to\
three hours for many Church\
0:56\
members to make the crossing\
from Vancouver, Canada,\
1:00\
while going to the\
Seattle Washington Temple.\
1:03\
President Gordon B.\
Hinckley, President\
1:06\
of the Church at\
that time, suggested\
1:09\
that a temple in Vancouver would\
bless members of the Church.\
1:13\
A site search was authorized,\
and after we examined\
1:17\
several Church-owned\
properties, other sites\
1:20\
not owned by the Church\
were also investigated.\
1:23\
A beautiful site\
with religious zoning\
1:26\
adjacent to the Trans-Canadian\
Highway was found.\
1:30\
The property had\
excellent access,\
1:32\
was dotted with beautiful\
Canadian pine trees,\
1:35\
and enjoyed a prominent\
location which\
1:38\
would make it visible to\
thousands of passing motorists.\
1:42\
We presented the site\
with pictures and maps\
1:45\
in the monthly Temple\
Sites Committee meeting.\
1:48\
President Hinckley authorized\
that we place it under contract\
1:52\
and complete the\
necessary studies.\
1:55\
In December of that year we\
reported back to the committee\
1:58\
that the studies were complete,\
and we sought approval\
2:02\
to proceed with the purchase.\
2:04\
After hearing our report,\
President Hinckley said,\
2:07\
"I feel I should see this site."\
2:11\
Later that month, two\
days after Christmas,\
2:14\
we left for Vancouver\
with President Hinckley,\
2:16\
President Thomas S. Monson,\
and Bill Williams, a temple\
2:20\
architect.\
2:21\
We were met by Paul Christensen,\
the local stake president,\
2:25\
who transported us to the site.\
2:27\
It was a little wet\
and misty that day,\
2:30\
but President Hinckley\
jumped out of the car\
2:32\
and began walking\
all over the site.\
2:36\
After spending time on the\
site, I asked President Hinckley\
2:40\
if he would like to see\
some of the other sites that\
2:42\
had been considered.\
2:44\
He said yes, he would like that.\
2:46\
You see, by looking\
at the other sites,\
2:49\
we were able to make a\
comparison of their virtues.\
2:53\
We did a large clockwise\
loop around Vancouver,\
2:56\
looking at the other properties,\
ultimately arriving back\
3:00\
at the original site.\
3:01\
President Hinckley said,\
"This is a beautiful site."\
3:05\
Then he asked, "Can we go to\
the Church-owned meetinghouse\
3:09\
about one-quarter mile away?"\
3:12\
"Of course, President,"\
we responded.\
3:14\
We got back into\
the cars and drove\
3:17\
to the nearby meetinghouse.\
3:18\
As we arrived at the chapel,\
President Hinckley said,\
3:22\
"Turn left here."\
3:24\
We turned and followed\
the street as instructed.\
3:27\
The street began\
to rise slightly.\
3:30\
Just as the car reached\
the crown of the rise,\
3:33\
President Hinckley said,\
"Stop the car; stop the car."\
3:38\
He then pointed to the\
right at a parcel of ground\
3:41\
and said, "What\
about this property?\
3:44\
This is where the temple goes.\
3:47\
This is where the\
Lord wants the temple.\
3:49\
Can you get it?\
3:51\
Can you get it?"\
3:53\
We hadn't looked\
at this property.\
3:55\
It was farther back and\
away from the main road,\
3:58\
and it was not listed for sale.\
4:00\
When we responded\
we didn't know,\
4:02\
President Hinckley pointed to\
the property and said again,\
4:06\
"This is where the temple goes."\
4:08\
We stayed a few minutes,\
then left for the airport\
4:11\
to return home.\
4:13\
The next day Brother\
Williams and I\
4:15\
were called to President\
Hinckley's office.\
4:17\
He had drawn out everything\
on a piece of paper:\
4:20\
the roads, the chapel,\
turn left here, x\
4:23\
marks the spot for the temple.\
4:28\
He asked what we had found out.\
4:30\
We told him he\
couldn't have picked\
4:32\
a more difficult property.\
4:35\
It was owned by three\
individuals: one from Canada,\
4:39\
one from India,\
and one from China!\
4:42\
And it didn't have the\
necessary religious zoning.\
4:48\
"Well, do your best," he said.\
4:53\
Then the miracles happened.\
4:55\
Within several months we\
owned the property, and later\
4:59\
the city of Langley,\
British Columbia,\
5:01\
gave permission to\
build the temple.\
5:04\
In reflecting upon\
this experience,\
5:07\
I am humbled by the realization\
that while Brother Williams\
5:10\
and I possessed formal education\
and years of experience in real\
5:15\
estate and temple design,\
President Hinckley had no such\
5:19\
formal training, but he had\
something far greater--the gift\
5:23\
of prophetic seership.\
5:25\
He was able to envision where\
God's temple should stand.\
5:31\
When the Lord commanded\
the early Saints\
5:33\
in this dispensation\
to construct a temple,\
5:36\
He declared:\
5:37\
"But let a house be\
built unto my name\
5:40\
according to the pattern\
which I will show unto them.\
5:44\
"And if my people build it not\
according to the pattern which\
5:47\
I shall show ..., I will not\
accept it at their hands."\
5:51\
And as with the early Saints,\
so it is with us today:\
5:56\
the Lord has revealed\
and continues\
5:59\
to reveal to the\
President of the Church\
6:01\
the patterns by which\
the kingdom of God\
6:04\
is to be directed in our day.\
6:07\
And, at a personal level,\
he provides guidance\
6:11\
as to how each of us\
should direct our lives,\
6:14\
such that our\
conduct may likewise\
6:17\
be acceptable to the Lord.\
6:20\
In April 2013, I spoke\
about the efforts involved\
6:23\
in preparing every\
temple's foundation\
6:26\
to ensure that it can withstand\
the storms and calamities\
6:30\
to which it will be subjected.\
6:31\
But the foundation is\
just the beginning.\
6:34\
A temple is composed\
of many building\
6:36\
blocks, fitted\
together according\
6:39\
to predesigned patterns.\
6:41\
If our lives are to become\
the temples each of us\
6:44\
is striving to construct\
as taught by the Lord,\
6:48\
we could reasonably\
ask ourselves,\
6:51\
"What building blocks should\
we put in place in order\
6:54\
to make our lives\
beautiful, majestic,\
6:57\
and resistant to the\
storms of the world?"\
7:00\
We can find the answer to this\
question in the Book of Mormon.\
7:04\
Concerning the Book of Mormon,\
the Prophet Joseph Smith said,\
7:07\
"I told the brethren\
that the Book of Mormon\
7:10\
was the most correct\
of any book on earth,\
7:13\
and the keystone\
of our religion,\
7:15\
and a man would get nearer to\
God by abiding by its precepts,\
7:19\
than by any other book."\
7:21\
In the introduction\
to the Book of Mormon\
7:24\
we are taught that those\
who gain a divine witness\
7:27\
from the Holy Spirit\
that the Book of Mormon\
7:30\
is the word of God will also\
come to know by the same power\
7:34\
that Jesus Christ is the Savior\
of the world, that Joseph\
7:38\
Smith is His revelator and\
prophet of the Restoration,\
7:42\
and that The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
7:45\
is the Lord's kingdom once\
again established on the earth.\
7:50\
These, then, are some\
essential building blocks\
7:52\
of our individual\
faith and testimony:\
7:55\
Jesus Christ is the\
Savior of the world.\
7:58\
The Book of Mormon\
is the word of God.\
8:01\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints\
8:04\
is the kingdom of\
God on the earth.\
8:07\
And Joseph Smith is a prophet,\
and we have living prophets\
8:11\
on the earth today.\
8:14\
In recent months I have listened\
to every general conference\
8:17\
address which President Nelson\
has given since he was first\
8:21\
called as an Apostle.\
8:22\
This exercise has\
changed my life.\
8:26\
As I studied and pondered 34\
years of President Nelson's\
8:31\
collected wisdom, clear\
and consistent themes\
8:35\
emerged from his teachings.\
8:37\
Each of these themes relates\
to those building blocks just\
8:40\
mentioned or is\
another key building\
8:43\
block for our personal temples.\
8:45\
They include faith in the\
Lord Jesus Christ, repentance,\
8:50\
baptism for the\
remission of sins,\
8:53\
the gift of the Holy Ghost,\
redemption of the dead,\
8:56\
temple work, keeping\
the Sabbath day holy,\
9:00\
beginning with the end in mind,\
staying on the covenant path.\
9:05\
President Nelson\
has spoken of them\
9:07\
all with love and devotion.\
9:10\
The chief cornerstone and\
building block of the Church\
9:13\
and for our lives\
is Jesus Christ.\
9:17\
This is His Church.\
9:19\
President Nelson is His prophet.\
9:22\
President Nelson's\
teachings witness and reveal\
9:25\
for our benefit the life and\
character of Jesus Christ.\
9:32\
He speaks lovingly and\
knowingly of the Savior's nature\
9:36\
and of His mission.\
9:38\
He has also borne frequent and\
fervent testimony of the divine\
9:42\
calling of the living\
prophets--the Presidents\
9:45\
of the Church--under\
whom he has served.\
9:48\
Now, today, it is our\
privilege to sustain him\
9:52\
as the Lord's living\
prophet on the earth.\
9:55\
We are accustomed to\
sustaining Church leaders\
9:58\
through the divine pattern of\
raising our arms to the square\
10:02\
to manifest our\
acceptance and support.\
10:04\
We did this just\
a few minutes ago.\
10:07\
But true sustaining goes well\
beyond this physical token.\
10:12\
As noted in the Doctrine\
and Covenants, section 107,\
10:15\
the First Presidency\
is to be "upheld\
10:18\
by the confidence, faith,\
and prayer of the church."\
10:23\
We come to fully and truly\
sustain the living prophet\
10:27\
as we develop the pattern\
of confiding in his words,\
10:31\
having the faith\
to act upon them,\
10:33\
and then praying for the Lord's\
continued blessings upon him.\
10:38\
When I think of President\
Russell M. Nelson,\
10:40\
I take comfort in the words\
of the Savior when He said,\
10:45\
"And if my people\
will hearken unto\
10:47\
my voice, and unto the\
voice of my servants\
10:51\
whom I have appointed to\
lead my people, behold,\
10:55\
verily I say unto\
you, they shall not\
10:58\
be moved out of their place."\
11:01\
Listening to and hearkening\
to living prophets\
11:04\
will have profound, even\
life-changing effects\
11:07\
in our lives.\
11:08\
We are strengthened.\
11:10\
We are more assured and\
confident in the Lord.\
11:13\
We hear the word of the Lord.\
11:16\
We feel God's love.\
11:18\
We will know how to conduct\
our lives with purpose.\
11:22\
I love and sustain\
President Russell M. Nelson\
11:25\
and the others who have been\
called as prophets, seers,\
11:28\
and revelators.\
11:30\
I testify that he has the\
gifts the Lord has bestowed\
11:34\
upon his head, and I\
witness that as we solidify\
11:38\
in our lives the practice\
of listening to and heeding\
11:43\
the voice of the\
living prophets,\
11:45\
our lives will be\
built according\
11:47\
to the Lord's divine\
pattern for us\
11:49\
and we will reap\
eternal blessings.\
11:52\
The invitation is\
extended to all.\
11:56\
Come, listen to a prophet's\
voice; yea, come unto Christ\
12:02\
and live.\
12:03\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen\
