Thank you, choir.\
0:05\
My beloved brothers and sisters,\
on this beautiful Sabbath day\
0:09\
we rejoice together in our\
many blessings from the Lord.\
0:13\
We are very grateful for your\
testimonies of the restored\
0:18\
gospel of Jesus Christ,\
for the sacrifices you've\
0:22\
made to stay on or return\
to His covenant path,\
0:27\
and for your consecrated\
service in His Church.\
0:34\
Today I feel compelled\
to discuss with you\
0:37\
a matter of great importance.\
0:40\
Some weeks ago, I\
released a statement\
0:43\
regarding a course correction\
for the name of the Church.\
0:48\
I did this because the\
Lord impressed upon my mind\
0:51\
the importance of the name\
He decreed for His Church,\
0:56\
even The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
1:02\
As you would expect,\
responses to this statement\
1:05\
and to the revised style\
guide have been mixed.\
1:09\
Many members\
immediately corrected\
1:12\
the name of the Church on their\
blogs and social media pages.\
1:17\
Others wondered why, with all\
that's going on in the world,\
1:20\
it was necessary to emphasize\
something so "inconsequential."\
1:27\
And some said it couldn't\
be done, so why even try?\
1:34\
Let me explain why we care\
so deeply about this issue.\
1:43\
But first let me state\
what this effort is not:\
1:49\
It is not a name change.\
1:52\
It is not rebranding.\
1:56\
It is not cosmetic.\
2:00\
It is not a whim.\
2:03\
And it is not inconsequential.\
2:08\
Instead, it is a correction.\
2:11\
It is the command of the Lord.\
2:18\
Joseph Smith did not name the\
Church restored through him;\
2:21\
neither did Mormon.\
2:23\
It was the Savior Himself\
who said, "For thus shall\
2:29\
my church be called\
in the last days,\
2:31\
even The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints."\
2:39\
Even earlier, in AD 34,\
our resurrected Lord\
2:46\
gave similar instruction\
to members of His Church\
2:49\
when He visited them\
in the Americas.\
2:52\
At that time He said:\
2:56\
"Ye shall call the\
church in my name. ...\
3:01\
"And how be it my church\
save it be called in my name?\
3:06\
For if a church be\
called in Moses' name\
3:10\
then it be Moses'\
church; or if it\
3:14\
be called in the name of a man\
then it be the church of a man;\
3:18\
but if it be called in my\
name then it is my church."\
3:25\
Thus, the name of the\
Church is not negotiable.\
3:32\
When the Savior clearly states\
what the name of His Church\
3:35\
should be and even\
precedes His declaration\
3:39\
with "Thus shall my church\
be called," He is serious.\
3:47\
And if we allow nicknames\
to be used or adopt or even\
3:51\
sponsor those nicknames\
ourselves, He is offended.\
3:59\
What's in a name or, in\
this case, a nickname?\
4:05\
When it comes to nicknames\
of the Church, such as "LDS\
4:10\
Church," the "Mormon Church,"\
or the "Church of the Latter-day\
4:16\
Saints," the most\
glaring omission\
4:20\
is the absence of\
the Savior's name.\
4:26\
To remove the Lord's name\
from the Lord's Church\
4:29\
is a major victory for Satan.\
4:35\
When we discard\
the Savior's name,\
4:37\
we are subtly disregarding\
all that Jesus Christ did\
4:41\
for us--even His Atonement.\
4:48\
Consider this from\
His perspective:\
4:51\
Premortally He was Jehovah,\
God of the Old Testament.\
4:57\
Under the direction\
of His Father,\
5:00\
He was the Creator of\
this and other worlds.\
5:03\
He chose to submit to\
the will of His Father\
5:07\
and do something for\
all of God's children\
5:09\
that no one else could do!\
5:12\
Condescending to come to\
earth as the Only Begotten\
5:16\
of the Father in the flesh,\
He was brutally reviled,\
5:21\
mocked, spit upon, and scourged.\
5:26\
In the Garden of\
Gethsemane, our Savior\
5:28\
took upon Himself every\
pain, every sin, and all\
5:33\
of the anguish and suffering\
ever experienced by you and me\
5:40\
and by everyone that has\
ever or will ever live.\
5:46\
Under the weight of that\
excruciating burden,\
5:49\
He bled from every pore.\
5:52\
All of this suffering was\
intensified as He was cruelly\
5:57\
crucified on Calvary's cross.\
6:02\
Through these excruciating\
experiences and His subsequent\
6:06\
Resurrection--His infinite\
Atonement--He granted\
6:11\
immortality to all and ransomed\
each one of us from the effects\
6:17\
of sin, on condition\
of our repentance.\
6:23\
Following the\
Savior's Resurrection\
6:25\
and the death of His\
Apostles, the world\
6:27\
plunged into\
centuries of darkness.\
6:32\
Then in the year 1820, God\
the Father and His Son,\
6:36\
Jesus Christ, appeared to\
the Prophet Joseph Smith\
6:39\
to initiate the Restoration\
of the Lord's Church.\
6:46\
After all He had endured--and\
after all He had done\
6:51\
for humankind--I realize with\
profound regret that we have\
6:58\
unwittingly acquiesced in the\
Lord's restored Church being\
7:05\
called by other names, each of\
which expunges the sacred name\
7:10\
of Jesus Christ!\
7:17\
Every Sunday as we partake\
worthily of the sacrament,\
7:20\
we make anew our sacred\
promise to our Heavenly Father\
7:24\
that we are willing to take upon\
us the name of His Son, Jesus\
7:30\
Christ.\
7:31\
We promise to follow Him,\
repent, keep His commandments,\
7:36\
and always remember Him.\
7:40\
When we omit His\
name from His Church,\
7:43\
we are inadvertently\
removing Him\
7:47\
as the central\
focus of our lives.\
7:52\
Taking the Savior's name\
upon us includes declaring\
7:55\
and witnessing to\
others--through our actions\
7:58\
and our words--that\
Jesus is the Christ.\
8:03\
Have we been so afraid to offend\
someone who called us "Mormons"\
8:08\
that we have failed to\
defend the Savior Himself,\
8:12\
to stand up for Him even in\
the name by which His Church is\
8:17\
called?\
8:20\
If we as a people and as\
individuals are to have access\
8:24\
to the power of the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ--to cleanse\
8:28\
and heal us, to\
strengthen and magnify us,\
8:33\
and ultimately to exalt us--we\
must clearly acknowledge Him\
8:39\
as the source of that power.\
8:44\
We can begin by calling His\
Church by the name He decreed.\
8:50\
For much of the world,\
the Lord's Church\
8:52\
is presently disguised\
as the "Mormon Church."\
8:59\
But we as members\
of the Lord's Church\
9:01\
know who stands at its\
head: Jesus Christ Himself.\
9:09\
Unfortunately, many who\
hear the term Mormon\
9:11\
think that we worship Mormon.\
9:14\
Not so!\
9:17\
We honor and respect that\
great ancient American prophet.\
9:22\
But we are not\
Mormon's disciples.\
9:26\
We are the Lord's disciples.\
9:30\
In the early days of\
the restored Church,\
9:33\
terms such as Mormon Church\
and Mormons were often used\
9:39\
as epithets--as cruel terms,\
abusive terms--designed\
9:46\
to obliterate God's hand in\
restoring the Church of Jesus\
9:49\
Christ in these latter days.\
9:54\
Brothers and sisters, there\
are many worldly arguments\
9:57\
against restoring the\
correct name of the Church.\
10:00\
Because of the digital world in\
which we live and with search\
10:06\
engine optimization that helps\
all of us find information we\
10:10\
need almost instantly--including\
information about\
10:14\
the Lord's Church--critics say\
that a correction at this point\
10:20\
is unwise.\
10:23\
Others feel that because\
we are known so widely\
10:27\
as "Mormons" and as\
the "Mormon Church,"\
10:29\
we should make the best of it.\
10:34\
If this were a\
discussion about branding\
10:36\
a man-made organization,\
those arguments might prevail.\
10:42\
But in this crucial\
matter, we look\
10:44\
to Him whose Church\
this is and acknowledge\
10:48\
that the Lord's ways are not,\
and never will be, man's ways.\
10:53\
If we will be patient and\
if we will do our part well,\
10:59\
the Lord will lead us\
through this important task.\
11:06\
After all, we know\
that the Lord helps\
11:08\
those who seek to\
do His will, just\
11:12\
as He helped Nephi accomplish\
the task of building a ship\
11:15\
to cross the sea.\
11:19\
We will want to be courteous\
and patient in our efforts\
11:23\
to correct these errors.\
11:25\
Responsible media will be\
sympathetic in responding\
11:30\
to our request.\
11:35\
In a previous\
general conference,\
11:37\
Elder Benjamin De Hoyos\
spoke of such an event.\
11:45\
Benjamin said:\
11:47\
"Some years ago while serving\
in the office of public affairs\
11:51\
of the Church in Mexico, [a\
companion and I] were invited\
11:55\
to participate in a\
radio talk show. ...\
11:58\
[One of the program\
directors] asked [us],\
12:02\
'Why does the Church have\
such a long name?' ...\
12:08\
"My companion and I smiled at\
such a magnificent question\
12:13\
and then proceeded to explain\
that the name of the Church\
12:17\
was not chosen by man.\
12:19\
It was given by the Savior.\
12:22\
...\
12:23\
The program director immediately\
and respectfully responded,\
12:28\
'We will thus repeat it\
with great pleasure.'"\
12:37\
Well, that report\
provides a pattern.\
12:40\
One by one, our best\
efforts as individuals\
12:45\
will be required to\
correct errors that have\
12:47\
crept in through the years.\
12:51\
The rest of the\
world may or may not\
12:53\
follow our lead in calling\
us by the correct name.\
12:56\
But it is disingenuous\
for us to be frustrated\
13:00\
if most of the world calls\
the Church and its members\
13:03\
by the wrong names\
if we do the same.\
13:09\
Our revised style\
guide is helpful.\
13:12\
It states: "In the\
first reference,\
13:16\
the full name of the\
Church is preferred:\
13:18\
'The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.'\
13:22\
When a shortened [second]\
reference is needed,\
13:26\
the terms 'the Church' or\
the 'Church of Jesus Christ'\
13:32\
are encouraged.\
13:34\
The 'restored Church\
of Jesus Christ'\
13:38\
is also accurate\
and encouraged."\
13:43\
Now, if someone should\
ask, "Are you a Mormon?"\
13:48\
you could reply,\
"If you are asking\
13:51\
if I am a member of The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
13:54\
Saints, yes, I am!"\
14:02\
If someone asks, "Are\
you a Latter-day Saint?"\
14:06\
you might respond, "Yes, I am.\
14:08\
I believe in Jesus Christ and\
am a member of His restored\
14:11\
Church."\
14:15\
My dear brothers and\
sisters, I promise\
14:18\
that if we will do\
our best to restore\
14:20\
the correct name of the Lord's\
Church, He whose Church this is\
14:25\
will pour down His\
power and blessings\
14:29\
upon the heads of the Latter-day\
Saints, the likes of which we\
14:33\
have never seen.\
14:37\
We will have the\
knowledge and power of God\
14:40\
to help us take the blessings\
of the restored gospel of Jesus\
14:43\
Christ to every nation,\
kindred, tongue, and people\
14:49\
and to prepare the world for\
the Second Coming of the Lord.\
14:55\
So what's in a name?\
14:59\
When it comes to the name\
of the Lord's Church,\
15:01\
the answer is "Everything!"\
15:06\
Jesus Christ directed us to\
call the Church by His name\
15:09\
because it is His Church,\
filled with His power.\
15:16\
I know that God lives.\
15:18\
Jesus is the Christ.\
15:21\
He leads His Church today.\
15:25\
I so testify in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
