In a recent conversation\
with a friend of mine,\
0:03\
he told me that when he was a\
young, newly baptized member\
0:07\
of the Church, he suddenly\
felt like somehow he did not\
0:10\
fit in anymore in his ward.\
0:12\
The missionaries who had taught\
him had been transferred away,\
0:15\
and he felt like he\
was on the periphery.\
0:17\
Without friends in the ward,\
he found his old friends,\
0:21\
and with them engaged in\
activities that took him away\
0:24\
from participating at church--so\
much so that he began to stray\
0:28\
from the flock.\
0:29\
With tears in his eyes, he\
described how deeply grateful\
0:33\
he was when a fellow ward\
member extended a ministering\
0:37\
hand to him and\
invited him to return\
0:40\
in a warm and inclusive way.\
0:42\
Within months, he was back\
in the safety of the flock,\
0:47\
strengthening others\
as well as himself.\
0:50\
Aren't we grateful for\
the shepherd in Brazil who\
0:53\
sought after this young\
man, Elder Carlos A. Godoy,\
0:57\
who now sits behind me as\
a member of the Presidency\
1:01\
of the Seventy?\
1:03\
Isn't it remarkable\
how such small efforts\
1:05\
can have eternal consequences?\
1:08\
This truth is at the heart\
of the Church's ministering\
1:12\
efforts.\
1:13\
Heavenly Father can take\
our simple daily efforts\
1:17\
and turn them into\
something miraculous.\
1:20\
It has only been six months\
since President Russell M.\
1:24\
Nelson announced that "the Lord\
has made important adjustments\
1:29\
in the way we care\
for each other,"\
1:30\
explaining, "We will\
implement a newer,\
1:34\
holier approach to caring for\
and ministering to others.\
1:38\
We will refer to these efforts\
simply as 'ministering.'"\
1:42\
President Nelson also explained:\
"A hallmark of the Lord's true\
1:47\
and living Church will\
always be an organized,\
1:50\
directed effort to minister\
to individual children of God\
1:54\
and ... families.\
1:55\
Because it is His Church,\
we as His servants\
2:00\
will minister to the\
one, just as He did.\
2:03\
We will minister in His name,\
with His power and authority,\
2:07\
and with His loving-kindness."\
2:11\
Well, since that\
announcement, your response\
2:13\
has been incredible!\
2:15\
We have received\
reports of great success\
2:18\
in implementing these changes in\
nearly every stake in the world\
2:22\
as directed by our\
living prophet.\
2:24\
For example, ministering\
brothers and sisters have been\
2:28\
assigned to families,\
companionships--including young\
2:32\
men and young women--have\
been organized,\
2:34\
and ministering interviews\
are taking place.\
2:37\
I don't think it's a coincidence\
that six months prior\
2:41\
to the revelatory\
announcement of yesterday,\
2:44\
"a new balance between gospel\
instruction in the home\
2:48\
and in the church," the\
revelatory announcement\
2:51\
on "ministering" was given.\
2:53\
Beginning January, as we spend\
one less hour in our church\
2:59\
worship, all that we have\
learned in ministering\
3:03\
will help us rebalance\
that void in a higher\
3:08\
and holier home-centered Sabbath\
day experience with family\
3:12\
and loved ones.\
3:14\
With these organizational\
structures in place,\
3:17\
we might ask, how\
do we know we are\
3:20\
ministering in the Lord's way?\
3:22\
Are we assisting the Good\
Shepherd in the way He intends?\
3:27\
In a recent discussion with\
President Henry B. Eyring,\
3:30\
he commended the\
Saints in adjusting\
3:33\
to these notable changes but\
also expressed his sincere hope\
3:39\
that members recognize\
that ministering\
3:42\
is more than "just being nice."\
3:46\
That is not to say that being\
nice is inconsequential,\
3:49\
but those who understand the\
true spirit of ministering\
3:53\
realize that it goes far\
beyond merely being nice.\
3:57\
Done in the Lord's\
way, ministering\
4:00\
can have a\
far-reaching influence\
4:03\
for good that ripples\
throughout all eternity,\
4:06\
as it has for Elder Godoy.\
4:10\
"The Savior showed by example\
what it means to minister as He\
4:13\
served out of love. ...\
4:15\
He ... taught, prayed\
for, comforted,\
4:17\
and blessed those around Him,\
inviting all to follow Him. ...\
4:21\
As Church members minister\
[in a higher and holier way],\
4:25\
they prayerfully seek to\
serve as He would--to ...\
4:29\
'watch over the church always,\
and be with and strengthen\
4:32\
them,' to 'visit the house of\
each member,' and help each\
4:35\
become a true disciple of ...\
4:37\
Christ."\
4:38\
Continuing the thread introduced\
by Sister Cordon this morning,\
4:42\
a true shepherd loves his\
sheep, knows each one by name,\
4:47\
and "has personal\
interest in" them.\
4:51\
My friend of many years\
spent his life as a rancher,\
4:54\
doing the hard work of\
raising cattle and sheep\
4:58\
in the rugged Rocky Mountains.\
5:01\
He once shared with me\
the challenges and hazards\
5:04\
associated with raising sheep.\
5:07\
He described that in\
early spring, when\
5:10\
snow on the expansive mountain\
range had mostly melted,\
5:14\
he placed the family herd\
of approximately 2,000 sheep\
5:18\
in the mountains for the summer.\
5:21\
There, he watched over\
the sheep until late fall,\
5:25\
when they were moved\
from the summer range\
5:27\
to a winter range in the desert.\
5:29\
He described how tending a large\
flock of sheep was difficult,\
5:35\
requiring early days and late\
nights--waking well before\
5:39\
sunrise and finishing\
long after dark.\
5:42\
He could not\
possibly do it alone.\
5:45\
Others helped tend\
the flock, including\
5:47\
a mix of experienced ranch hands\
assisted by younger hands who\
5:51\
were benefiting from the\
wisdom of their companions.\
5:55\
He also relied on two old\
horses, two colts in training,\
6:00\
two old sheepdogs, and two\
or three sheepdog pups.\
6:04\
Over the course of the summer,\
my friend and his sheep\
6:08\
faced wind and rainstorms,\
sickness, injuries, drought,\
6:13\
and just about every other\
hardship one can imagine.\
6:17\
Some years they had to\
haul water all summer\
6:20\
just to keep the sheep alive.\
6:22\
Then every year in late fall,\
when winter weather threatened\
6:27\
and the sheep were taken off\
the mountain and counted,\
6:30\
there were usually more\
than 200 that were lost.\
6:35\
The flock of 2,000 sheep\
placed in the mountains\
6:38\
in early spring was\
reduced to less than 1,800.\
6:42\
Most of the missing\
sheep were not\
6:44\
lost to sickness\
or natural death\
6:47\
but to predators such as\
mountain lions or coyotes.\
6:52\
These predators\
usually found the lambs\
6:55\
that had strayed from\
the safety of the flock,\
6:57\
withdrawing themselves from the\
protection of their shepherd.\
7:01\
Would you consider for a moment\
what I have just described,\
7:04\
in a spiritual context?\
7:07\
Who is the shepherd?\
7:09\
Who is the flock?\
7:11\
Who are those who\
assist the shepherd?\
7:14\
The Lord Jesus Christ Himself\
said, "I am the good shepherd,\
7:19\
and know my sheep, ... and I\
lay down my life for the sheep."\
7:24\
The prophet Nephi\
likewise taught\
7:26\
that Jesus "shall\
feed his sheep,\
7:29\
and in him they\
shall find pasture."\
7:32\
I find abiding peace in knowing\
that "the Lord is my shepherd"\
7:38\
and that each of us is known\
by Him and under His care.\
7:42\
When we confront life's wind and\
rainstorms, sickness, injuries,\
7:46\
and drought, the Lord--our\
Shepherd--will minister to us.\
7:50\
He will restore our souls.\
7:53\
In the same way that my\
friend tended his sheep\
7:56\
with the assistance of young\
and old ranch hands, horses,\
7:59\
and sheepdogs, the Lord\
also requires assistance\
8:03\
in the challenging\
labor of caring\
8:06\
for the sheep in His flock.\
8:09\
As children of a\
loving Heavenly Father\
8:12\
and as sheep in His flock,\
we enjoy the blessings\
8:16\
of being individually\
ministered to by Jesus Christ.\
8:20\
Simultaneously, we\
have a responsibility\
8:24\
to provide ministering\
assistance to others around us\
8:28\
as shepherds ourselves.\
8:30\
We heed the words of the Lord\
to "serve me and go forth\
8:33\
in my name, and ...\
gather together my sheep."\
8:38\
Who is the shepherd?\
8:39\
Every man, woman, and\
child in the kingdom of God\
8:42\
is a shepherd.\
8:44\
No calling is required.\
8:46\
From the moment we emerge\
from the waters of baptism,\
8:50\
we are commissioned\
to this work.\
8:52\
We reach out in love to\
others because it is what\
8:55\
our Savior commanded us to do.\
8:58\
Alma emphasized, "For\
what shepherd ...\
9:01\
having many sheep doth\
not watch over them,\
9:03\
that the wolves [may not enter]\
and devour his flock? ...\
9:08\
Doth [not he] drive him out?"\
9:12\
Whenever our neighbors\
are in distress temporally\
9:16\
or spiritually, we\
run to their aid.\
9:19\
We bear one another's burdens\
that they may be light.\
9:22\
We mourn with those who mourn.\
9:23\
We comfort those that\
stand in need of comfort.\
9:26\
The Lord lovingly\
expects this of us.\
9:30\
And the day will come when\
we will be held accountable\
9:33\
for the care we take in\
ministering to His flock.\
9:38\
My shepherd friend shared\
another important element\
9:41\
in the watchcare of\
sheep on the range.\
9:43\
He described that\
lost sheep were\
9:46\
particularly vulnerable to\
the dangers of predators.\
9:49\
In fact, up to 15 percent of\
his and his team's total time\
9:52\
was devoted to\
finding lost sheep.\
9:56\
The sooner they\
found lost sheep,\
9:57\
before the sheep drifted too far\
from the flock, the less likely\
10:02\
the sheep were to be harmed.\
10:04\
Recovering lost sheep required\
much patience and discipline.\
10:09\
Some years ago I\
found an article\
10:11\
in a local newspaper so\
intriguing that I saved it.\
10:15\
The front-page headline\
read, "Determined Dog\
10:20\
Won't Abandon Lost Sheep."\
10:23\
This article describes\
a small number\
10:25\
of sheep belonging\
to an operation\
10:27\
not far from my friend's\
property that were somehow left\
10:31\
behind in their summer range.\
10:33\
Two or three months later, they\
became stranded and snowbound\
10:39\
in the mountains.\
10:40\
When the sheep were left\
behind, the sheepdog\
10:43\
stayed with them,\
for it was his duty\
10:45\
to look after and\
protect the sheep.\
10:48\
He would not go off watch!\
10:51\
There he remained--circling\
about the lost sheep for months\
10:56\
in the cold and snowy weather,\
serving as a protection against\
11:00\
coyotes, mountain lions, or any\
other predator that would harm\
11:04\
the sheep.\
11:05\
He stayed there until he\
was able to lead or herd\
11:10\
the sheep back to the safety\
of the shepherd and the flock.\
11:14\
The image captured on the\
front page of this article\
11:17\
allows one to see\
character in the eyes\
11:21\
and demeanor of this sheepdog.\
11:24\
In the New Testament, we find\
a parable and instruction\
11:27\
from the Savior that provides\
further insight pertaining\
11:32\
to our responsibility as\
shepherds, ministering sisters\
11:36\
and brothers of lost sheep:\
11:39\
"What man of you,\
having an hundred sheep,\
11:41\
if he lose one ..., doth not\
leave the ninety and nine\
11:46\
in the wilderness, and go\
after that which is lost,\
11:49\
until he find it?\
11:52\
"And when he hath found it,\
he layeth it on his shoulders,\
11:54\
rejoicing.\
11:56\
"And when he comes home, he\
calleth together his friends\
11:59\
and neighbours, saying\
unto them, Rejoice with me;\
12:04\
for I have found my\
sheep which was lost."\
12:09\
As we summarize the lesson\
taught in the parable,\
12:11\
we find this valuable counsel:\
12:14\
First, we are to\
identify the lost sheep.\
12:17\
Second, we search after\
them until they are found.\
12:21\
Third, when they\
are found, we may\
12:24\
have to lay them on our\
shoulders to bring them home.\
12:27\
Finally, we surround them with\
friends upon their return.\
12:33\
Brothers and sisters,\
our greatest challenges\
12:36\
and our greatest\
rewards may come as we\
12:40\
minister to lost sheep.\
12:42\
The members of the Church in the\
Book of Mormon "watch[ed] over\
12:46\
their people, and did nourish\
them with things pertaining\
12:49\
to righteousness."\
12:50\
We can follow their examples\
and remember that ministering is\
12:55\
to be "led by the Spirit,\
... flexible, and ...\
12:59\
customized to the\
needs of each member."\
13:02\
It is also critical that we\
"seek to help individuals\
13:06\
and families prepare for\
their next ordinance,\
13:09\
keep [their] covenants ...,\
and become self-reliant."\
13:14\
Every soul is precious\
to our Heavenly Father.\
13:17\
His personal\
invitation to minister\
13:20\
is of greatest\
value and importance\
13:23\
to Him, for it is\
His work and glory.\
13:26\
It is quite literally\
the work of eternity.\
13:29\
Each one of His children\
has immeasurable potential\
13:33\
in His sight.\
13:34\
He loves you with a love\
you cannot even begin\
13:37\
to comprehend.\
13:39\
Like the devoted\
sheepdog, the Lord\
13:43\
will stay on the\
mountain to protect you\
13:45\
through the wind,\
rainstorms, snow, and more.\
13:51\
President Russell\
M. Nelson taught\
13:53\
us last conference: "Our\
message to the world\
13:57\
[and may I add, to\
our ministering flock]\
14:00\
is simple and sincere: we\
invite all of God's children\
14:05\
on both sides of the veil\
to come unto their Savior,\
14:09\
receive the blessings of the\
holy temple, have enduring joy,\
14:13\
and qualify for eternal life."\
14:16\
May we raise our sights\
to this prophetic vision\
14:19\
so we can shepherd\
souls to the temple\
14:21\
and ultimately to our\
Savior, Jesus Christ.\
14:24\
He does not expect us\
to perform miracles.\
14:27\
He only asks that we bring our\
brothers and sisters unto Him,\
14:31\
for He has the power\
to redeem souls.\
14:35\
As we do so, we can and\
will secure this promise:\
14:39\
"And when the chief\
Shepherd shall appear,\
14:41\
ye shall receive a crown of\
glory that fadeth not away."\
14:47\
Of this I testify,\
and of Jesus Christ\
14:50\
as our Savior and our Redeemer,\
in the name of Jesus Christ,\
14:57\
amen.\
