My dear brothers and sisters,\
we have looked forward\
0:04\
to gathering with you again in\
this October general conference\
0:08\
session of the Church.\
0:10\
We extend our heartfelt\
welcome to each of you.\
0:15\
We are deeply grateful for\
your sustaining prayers.\
0:19\
We can feel their effect.\
0:21\
Thank you!\
0:24\
We are grateful for\
your tremendous efforts\
0:26\
to follow through with counsel\
given at general conference six\
0:29\
months ago.\
0:30\
Stake presidencies\
throughout the world\
0:33\
have sought revelation necessary\
to reorganize elders quorums.\
0:39\
Men of those quorums, along with\
our dedicated Relief Society\
0:42\
sisters, are working\
diligently to minister\
0:46\
to our brothers and sisters\
in a higher, holier way.\
0:52\
We are inspired by your goodness\
and extraordinary efforts\
0:56\
to bring the Savior's love\
to your families, neighbors,\
1:00\
and friends and to minister\
to them as He would.\
1:07\
Since April conference,\
Sister Nelson and I\
1:11\
have met with members\
on four continents\
1:14\
and on islands of the sea.\
1:16\
From Jerusalem to Harare,\
from Winnipeg to Bangkok,\
1:22\
we have experienced your\
great faith and the strength\
1:26\
of your testimonies.\
1:28\
We are overjoyed with\
the number of our youth\
1:31\
who have joined the Lord's\
youth battalion to help\
1:34\
gather scattered Israel.\
1:38\
We thank you!\
1:40\
And as you continue to\
follow my invitations offered\
1:43\
at our worldwide\
youth devotional,\
1:46\
you are setting a standard\
for the rest of us to follow.\
1:50\
And what a difference\
you youth are making!\
1:57\
In recent years, we in\
the presiding councils\
2:01\
of the Church have wrestled\
with a fundamental question: how\
2:06\
can we take the gospel\
in its simple purity\
2:09\
and the ordinances with\
their eternal efficacy\
2:14\
to all of God's children?\
2:18\
As Latter-day Saints,\
we have become\
2:20\
accustomed to\
thinking of "church"\
2:22\
as something that happens\
in our meetinghouses,\
2:26\
supported by what\
happens at home.\
2:29\
We need an adjustment\
to this pattern.\
2:34\
It is time for a home-centered\
Church, supported\
2:40\
by what takes place inside\
our branch, ward, and stake\
2:44\
buildings.\
2:46\
As the Church continues to\
expand throughout the world,\
2:50\
many members live where we\
have no chapels--and may not\
2:56\
for the foreseeable future.\
3:00\
I remember a family who,\
because of such circumstances,\
3:04\
was required to\
meet in their home.\
3:07\
I asked the mother\
how she liked going\
3:10\
to church in her own home.\
3:13\
She replied, "I like it!\
3:18\
My husband uses better\
language at home now,\
3:21\
knowing that he will bless\
the sacrament each Sunday."\
3:29\
The long-standing\
objective of the Church\
3:32\
is to assist all members\
to increase their faith\
3:36\
in our Lord Jesus Christ\
and in His Atonement,\
3:41\
to assist them in\
making and keeping\
3:44\
their covenants with God,\
and to strengthen and seal\
3:50\
their families.\
3:52\
In this complex world\
today, this is not easy.\
3:56\
The adversary is\
increasing his attacks\
4:00\
on faith and upon\
us and our families\
4:04\
at an exponential rate.\
4:07\
To survive spiritually, we need\
counterstrategies and proactive\
4:12\
plans.\
4:14\
Accordingly, we now\
want to put in place\
4:17\
organizational adjustments\
that will further fortify\
4:20\
our members and their families.\
4:25\
For many years\
Church leaders have\
4:27\
been working on an\
integrated curriculum\
4:30\
to strengthen families\
and individuals\
4:32\
through a home-centered\
and Church-supported plan\
4:37\
to learn doctrine, strengthen\
faith, and foster greater\
4:43\
personal worship.\
4:46\
Our efforts over these recent\
years to hallow the Sabbath--to\
4:50\
make it a delight and a\
personal sign to God of our love\
4:55\
for Him--will be augmented by\
the adjustments we will now\
5:00\
introduce.\
5:02\
This morning we will announce\
a new balance and connection\
5:07\
between gospel instruction in\
the home and in the Church.\
5:13\
We are each responsible for our\
individual spiritual growth.\
5:18\
And scriptures make\
it clear that parents\
5:22\
have the primary\
responsibility to teach\
5:25\
the doctrine to their children.\
5:28\
It is the responsibility\
of the Church\
5:30\
to assist each member in\
that divinely appointed role\
5:35\
of increasing his or\
her gospel knowledge.\
5:41\
Elder Quentin L.\
Cook will now explain\
5:43\
these important adjustments.\
5:45\
All members of the Council\
of the First Presidency\
5:48\
and Quorum of the\
Twelve Apostles\
5:50\
are united in\
endorsing this message.\
5:54\
We gratefully acknowledge\
the inspiration\
5:57\
from the Lord that\
has influenced\
5:59\
the development of the\
plans and procedures\
6:03\
that Elder Cook will present.\
6:06\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
I know that God lives!\
6:11\
Jesus is the Christ!\
6:14\
This is His Church\
that He directs\
6:17\
by prophecy and revelation\
to His humble servants.\
6:21\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
