Good afternoon, my dear\
brothers and sisters.\
0:03\
As we say in my native Brazilian\
Portuguese, "Boa tarde!"\
0:07\
I feel blessed to\
gather together\
0:09\
in this wonderful\
general conference\
0:12\
of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
0:15\
under the direction of our\
beloved prophet, President\
0:18\
Russell M. Nelson.\
0:20\
I marvel at the great\
opportunity each one of us\
0:23\
has to listen to the Lord's\
voice through His servants\
0:27\
on earth in these latter\
days we are living in.\
0:32\
My home country of Brazil is\
very rich in natural resources.\
0:36\
One of them is the\
famous Amazon River,\
0:39\
one of the largest and\
longest rivers in the world.\
0:43\
It is formed by two separate\
rivers, the Solimoes and Negro.\
0:49\
Interestingly,\
they flow together\
0:51\
for a number of miles\
before the waters blend,\
0:54\
due to the rivers having very\
different origins, speeds,\
0:58\
temperatures, and\
chemical compositions.\
1:01\
After several miles,\
the waters finally\
1:04\
blend together, becoming\
a river different\
1:07\
than its individual parts.\
1:09\
Only after these parts\
merge, the Amazon River\
1:13\
becomes so powerful that when\
it reaches the Atlantic Ocean,\
1:18\
it pushes back the seawater\
so that fresh water can still\
1:22\
be found for many miles\
out into the ocean.\
1:27\
In a similar way that\
the Solimoes and Negro\
1:29\
Rivers flow together to\
make the great Amazon River,\
1:33\
the children of\
God come together\
1:36\
in the restored\
Church of Jesus Christ\
1:39\
from different social\
backgrounds, traditions,\
1:42\
and cultures, forming this\
wonderful community of Saints\
1:46\
in Christ.\
1:47\
Eventually, as we encourage,\
support, and love each other,\
1:51\
we combine to form a mighty\
force for good in the world.\
1:55\
As followers of Jesus\
Christ, flowing as one\
1:59\
in this river of\
goodness, we will\
2:01\
be able to provide the\
"fresh water" of the gospel\
2:05\
to a thirsty world.\
2:07\
The Lord has\
inspired His prophets\
2:10\
to teach us how we can support\
and love each other so we\
2:14\
can become united\
in faith and purpose\
2:16\
in following Jesus Christ.\
2:19\
Paul, the New Testament Apostle,\
taught that those who "have\
2:24\
been baptized into Christ\
have put on Christ ...\
2:27\
for ye are all one\
in Christ Jesus."\
2:31\
When we promise at baptism\
to follow the Savior,\
2:34\
we witness before\
the Father that we\
2:37\
are willing to take upon\
us the name of Christ.\
2:40\
And as we strive to acquire His\
divine attributes in our lives,\
2:45\
we become different than we were\
through the Atonement of Christ\
2:49\
the Lord, and our love for all\
people increases naturally.\
2:53\
We feel a sincere concern\
for everyone's welfare\
2:57\
and happiness.\
2:58\
We see each other as brothers\
and sisters, as children of God\
3:02\
with divine origin,\
attributes, and potential.\
3:06\
We desire to care for each other\
and bear one another's burdens.\
3:11\
This is what Paul\
described as charity.\
3:14\
Mormon, a prophet of\
the Book of Mormon,\
3:17\
described it as "the\
pure love of Christ,"\
3:20\
which is the most sublime,\
noblest, and strongest\
3:23\
form of love.\
3:24\
And our current prophet,\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
3:28\
recently described\
a manifestation\
3:30\
of this pure love of\
Christ as ministering,\
3:34\
which is a more focused\
and holier approach\
3:37\
to love and care for\
other individuals\
3:40\
like the Savior did.\
3:42\
Let us consider this\
principle of love and care\
3:45\
as the Savior did within\
the context of encouraging,\
3:49\
helping, and\
supporting those who\
3:52\
are recent converts and those\
beginning to show interest\
3:55\
in attending our\
Church services.\
3:59\
When these new friends\
come out of the world\
4:02\
and embrace the gospel of Jesus\
Christ, joining His Church,\
4:06\
they become His disciples,\
being born again through Him.\
4:11\
They leave behind a world they\
knew well and choose to follow\
4:15\
Jesus Christ with full purpose\
of heart, joining a new "river"\
4:20\
like the mighty Amazon River--a\
river that is a valiant force\
4:26\
of goodness and righteousness\
that flows toward the presence\
4:30\
of God.\
4:31\
The Apostle Peter describes\
it as a "chosen generation,\
4:35\
a royal priesthood, [a] holy\
nation, a peculiar people."\
4:40\
As these new friends merge into\
this new and unfamiliar river,\
4:46\
they may feel a\
little lost at first.\
4:49\
These new friends find\
themselves blending\
4:52\
into a river with unique\
origins, temperatures,\
4:55\
and chemical compositions--a\
river that has its own\
5:01\
traditions, culture,\
and vocabulary.\
5:04\
This new life in Christ may\
seem overwhelming for them.\
5:08\
Think for a moment about\
how they may feel as they\
5:11\
hear for the first time\
such expressions as "FHE,"\
5:17\
"BYC," "fast Sunday,"\
"baptism for the dead,"\
5:22\
"triple combination,"\
and so forth.\
5:25\
It is easy to see why they may\
feel like they don't belong.\
5:30\
In such situations,\
they may ask themselves,\
5:33\
"Is there a place for me here?\
5:35\
Do I fit in The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints?\
5:41\
Does the Church need me?\
5:42\
Will I find new friends willing\
to help and support me?"\
5:47\
My dear friends,\
in such moments,\
5:50\
those of us who are at different\
points in the long journey\
5:54\
of discipleship must extend\
a warm hand of fellowship\
5:59\
to our new friends, accept\
them where they are,\
6:03\
and help, love, and\
include them in our lives.\
6:08\
All of these new friends are\
precious sons and daughters\
6:11\
of God.\
6:12\
We cannot afford to\
lose even one of them,\
6:15\
because like the Amazon River\
that depends on tributaries\
6:19\
feeding it, we need them\
just as much as they need us,\
6:24\
to become a mighty force\
for good in the world.\
6:28\
Our new friends bring\
God-given talents, excitement,\
6:32\
and goodness within them.\
6:34\
Their enthusiasm for the\
gospel can be contagious,\
6:38\
thereby helping us revitalize\
our own testimonies.\
6:42\
They also bring\
fresh perspectives\
6:44\
to our understanding\
of life and the gospel.\
6:48\
We have long been taught how\
we can help our new friends\
6:52\
to feel welcome and\
loved in the restored\
6:55\
Church of Jesus Christ.\
6:57\
They need three things so they\
may remain strong and faithful\
7:01\
throughout their lives.\
7:03\
First, they need\
brothers and sisters\
7:06\
in the Church who are\
sincerely interested in them,\
7:10\
true and loyal friends to\
whom they can constantly turn,\
7:15\
who will walk\
beside them, and who\
7:17\
will answer their questions.\
7:19\
As members, we should\
always be attentive and look\
7:23\
for new faces when attending\
Church activities and meetings,\
7:28\
regardless of the\
responsibilities, assignments,\
7:32\
or concerns we may have.\
7:34\
We can do simple things to\
help these new friends feel\
7:37\
embraced and welcome\
in the Church,\
7:39\
such as giving a warm greeting,\
smiling sincerely at them,\
7:45\
sitting together to\
sing and worship,\
7:48\
introducing them to other\
members, and so forth.\
7:51\
As we open our hearts to our new\
friends in some of these ways,\
7:57\
we are acting in the\
spirit of ministering.\
8:00\
When we minister to them\
like the Savior did,\
8:04\
they won't feel like\
"strangers within our gates."\
8:07\
They will feel like they can\
fit in and make new friends,\
8:12\
and most importantly, they\
will feel the Savior's love\
8:16\
through our genuine care.\
8:19\
Second, new friends need an\
assignment--an opportunity\
8:23\
to serve others.\
8:24\
Service is one of the great\
geniuses of The Church of Jesus\
8:28\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
8:30\
It is a process by which\
our faith can grow stronger.\
8:34\
Every new friend deserves\
that opportunity.\
8:37\
While the bishop\
and ward council\
8:40\
have direct responsibility\
to extend assignments soon\
8:44\
after their baptism,\
nothing prevents us\
8:47\
as members from\
inviting our new friends\
8:50\
to help us serve\
others informally\
8:53\
or through service projects.\
8:56\
Third, new friends\
must be "nourished\
8:58\
by the good word of God."\
9:00\
We can help them\
to love and become\
9:03\
familiar with the scriptures\
as we read and discuss\
9:06\
the teachings with\
them, providing them\
9:09\
context to the stories and\
explaining difficult words.\
9:13\
We can also teach them how\
to receive personal guidance\
9:17\
through regular scripture study.\
9:20\
In addition, we can reach\
out to our new friends\
9:23\
in their own homes and\
invite them to ours\
9:26\
at times outside of our\
regularly scheduled Church\
9:30\
meetings and\
activities, helping them\
9:33\
merge into the mighty river\
of the community of Saints.\
9:38\
Recognizing the\
adjustments and challenges\
9:41\
our new friends make in\
becoming members of God's family\
9:45\
as brothers and\
sisters, we can share\
9:48\
how we have overcome similar\
challenges in our lives.\
9:53\
This will help them know\
that they are not alone\
9:57\
and that God will\
bless them as they\
10:00\
exercise faith in His promises.\
10:03\
When the Solimoes and Negro\
Rivers blend together,\
10:06\
the Amazon River becomes\
mighty and strong.\
10:10\
In a similar fashion, when\
we and our new friends\
10:14\
truly merge, the restored\
Church of Jesus Christ\
10:17\
becomes even stronger\
and steadier.\
10:20\
My sweetheart, Rosana, and I are\
so grateful for all those who\
10:30\
helped us to blend into this\
new river many years ago\
10:34\
when we embraced the\
gospel of Jesus Christ\
10:37\
in our home country of Brazil.\
10:39\
Throughout the years,\
these wonderful people\
10:43\
have truly ministered\
to us and have\
10:46\
helped us to continue\
flowing in righteousness.\
10:49\
We are so grateful for them.\
10:51\
The prophets in the\
Western Hemisphere\
10:54\
knew well how to keep new\
friends flowing faithfully\
11:00\
together into this new river of\
goodness toward eternal life.\
11:04\
For example, having\
seen our day and knowing\
11:07\
that we would face\
similar challenges,\
11:10\
Moroni included some of those\
important steps in his writings\
11:15\
in the Book of\
Mormon, and I quote:\
11:18\
"And after they had been\
received unto baptism,\
11:21\
and were wrought\
upon and cleansed\
11:24\
by the power of the\
Holy Ghost, they\
11:26\
were numbered among the people\
of the church of Christ;\
11:30\
and their names were taken,\
that they might be remembered\
11:33\
and nourished by the\
good word of God,\
11:36\
to keep them in the right\
way, to keep them continually\
11:39\
watchful unto\
prayer, relying alone\
11:43\
upon the merits of Christ, who\
was the author and the finisher\
11:47\
of their faith.\
11:49\
"And the church did\
meet together oft,\
11:51\
to fast and to pray,\
and to speak one\
11:55\
with another concerning the\
welfare of their souls."\
12:00\
My beloved companions\
in the work of the Lord,\
12:03\
I believe we can do much\
better and should do better\
12:07\
in welcoming new\
friends into the Church.\
12:10\
I invite you to\
consider what we can\
12:13\
do to be more embracing,\
accepting, and helpful to them,\
12:17\
starting this next very Sunday.\
12:20\
Be careful to not let your\
Church assignments get\
12:24\
in the way of welcoming new\
friends at Church meetings\
12:28\
and activities.\
12:29\
After all, these souls are\
precious before the eyes of God\
12:33\
and are much more important\
than programs and activities.\
12:37\
If we minister to\
our new members\
12:40\
with our hearts full of the pure\
love of the Savior as He did,\
12:46\
I promise you, in\
His name, that He\
12:49\
will assist us in our efforts.\
12:51\
When we act as faithful\
ministers as the Savior did,\
12:56\
our new friends\
will have the help\
12:58\
they need to remain\
strong, dedicated,\
13:01\
and faithful to the end.\
13:03\
They will join us as we\
become a mighty people of God\
13:08\
and will help us to bring fresh\
water to a world desperately\
13:13\
in need of the blessings of\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
13:16\
These children of God\
will feel like they\
13:19\
are "no more strangers\
and foreigners,\
13:22\
but fellowcitizens\
with the saints."\
13:25\
I promise you that\
they will recognize\
13:28\
the presence of our Savior\
Jesus Christ in His own Church.\
13:33\
They will continue to\
flow with us as a river\
13:36\
into the fountain of\
goodness until they\
13:39\
are received with open arms\
by our Lord Jesus Christ\
13:44\
and they hear the Father say,\
"Ye shall have eternal life."\
13:49\
I invite you to seek the\
Lord's help in loving others\
13:53\
as He has loved you.\
13:55\
Let us all follow the\
counsel of Mormon:\
13:59\
"Wherefore, my beloved\
brethren [and sisters],\
14:03\
pray unto the Father with\
all the energy of heart,\
14:07\
that ye may be filled with this\
love, which he hath bestowed\
14:12\
upon all who are true followers\
of his Son, Jesus Christ."\
14:17\
Of these truths I\
witness and do so\
14:21\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
