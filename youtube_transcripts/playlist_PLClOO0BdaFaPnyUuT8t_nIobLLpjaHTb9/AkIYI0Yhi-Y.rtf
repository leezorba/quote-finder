A few weeks ago I took\
part in the baptism\
0:05\
of several\
eight-year-old children.\
0:07\
They had begun to learn\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
0:11\
from their parents and teachers.\
0:13\
The seed of their faith\
in Him had begun to grow.\
0:16\
And now they wanted to follow\
Him into the waters of baptism\
0:21\
to become members of\
His restored Church.\
0:24\
As I watched their\
anticipation, I\
0:27\
wondered how much\
they understood\
0:28\
about one important aspect\
of their baptismal covenant:\
0:32\
their commitment to take upon\
themselves the name of Jesus\
0:37\
Christ.\
0:39\
From the beginning,\
God has declared\
0:41\
the preeminence of the name\
of Jesus Christ in His plan\
0:45\
for us.\
0:46\
An angel taught\
our first father,\
0:48\
Adam: "Thou shalt do\
all that thou doest\
0:51\
in the name of the Son, and\
thou shalt repent and call\
0:55\
upon God in the name of\
the Son forevermore."\
0:59\
The Book of Mormon prophet King\
Benjamin taught his people,\
1:03\
"There shall be no\
other name given\
1:06\
nor any other way nor means\
whereby salvation can come."\
1:12\
The Lord reiterated this truth\
to the Prophet Joseph Smith:\
1:15\
"Behold, Jesus Christ\
is the name which\
1:19\
is given of the Father, and\
there is none other name given\
1:23\
whereby man can be saved."\
1:26\
In our day, President Dallin H.\
Oaks has taught that "those who\
1:30\
exercise faith in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ ...\
1:35\
and enter into his covenant ...\
can lay claim on the atoning\
1:39\
sacrifice of Jesus Christ."\
1:42\
Our Heavenly Father wants\
to make it absolutely clear\
1:47\
that the name of His\
Son, Jesus Christ,\
1:51\
is not simply one\
name among many.\
1:54\
The Savior's name has\
singular and essential power.\
1:58\
It is the only name by\
which salvation is possible.\
2:05\
By emphasizing this truth\
in every dispensation,\
2:09\
our loving Father assures\
all of His children\
2:12\
that there is a way back to Him.\
2:16\
But having a sure way\
available does not\
2:20\
mean that our return is\
automatically assured.\
2:23\
God tells us that our\
action is required:\
2:27\
"Wherefore, all men [and women]\
must take upon them the name\
2:33\
which is given of the Father."\
2:36\
In order to access the saving\
power that comes only through\
2:40\
the name of Christ, we must\
"humble [ourselves] before God\
2:44\
... and come forth with broken\
hearts and contrite spirits ...\
2:50\
and [be] willing to take upon\
[us] the name of Jesus Christ"\
2:55\
and thereby qualify, like my\
young eight-year-old friends,\
3:00\
to "be received by\
baptism into his church."\
3:05\
All who sincerely desire to\
take the Savior's name upon them\
3:09\
must qualify for and receive\
the ordinance of baptism\
3:13\
as a physical witness to\
God of their decision.\
3:16\
But baptism is\
just the beginning.\
3:21\
The word take is not passive.\
3:23\
It is an action word with\
multiple definitions.\
3:26\
Likewise, our commitment\
to take upon us\
3:30\
the name of Jesus\
Christ requires action\
3:33\
and has multiple dimensions.\
3:37\
For example, one\
meaning of the word take\
3:40\
is to partake of or\
receive into one's body,\
3:45\
such as when we take a drink.\
3:48\
By taking upon ourselves\
the name of Christ,\
3:51\
we commit to take His\
teachings, His characteristics,\
3:55\
and ultimately His love\
deep into our beings\
3:58\
so that they become\
part of who we are.\
4:01\
Thus the importance of\
President Nelson's invitation\
4:05\
to young adults to "prayerfully\
and vigorously [seek]\
4:08\
to understand what each of\
[the Savior's] various titles\
4:11\
and names means\
personally for [them]"\
4:14\
and to feast on the words\
of Christ in the scriptures,\
4:18\
especially the Book of Mormon.\
4:21\
Another meaning of\
the word take is\
4:23\
to accept a person\
in a particular role\
4:26\
or embrace the truthfulness\
of an idea or principle.\
4:30\
When we take upon us\
the name of Christ,\
4:33\
we accept Him as our\
Savior and continually\
4:36\
embrace His teachings as\
the guide for our lives.\
4:40\
In every meaningful\
decision we make,\
4:43\
we can take His gospel\
to be true and obediently\
4:47\
live it with all of our heart,\
might, mind, and strength.\
4:52\
The word take can also\
mean to align oneself\
4:55\
with a name or a cause.\
4:58\
Most of us have\
had the experience\
5:00\
of taking on\
responsibility at work\
5:03\
or taking up a\
cause or a movement.\
5:06\
When we take upon ourselves\
the name of Christ,\
5:09\
we take upon us the\
responsibilities\
5:11\
of a true disciple,\
we advocate His cause,\
5:14\
and we "stand as witnesses\
of [Him] at all times\
5:18\
and in all things, and in all\
places that [we] may be in."\
5:23\
President Nelson has called upon\
"every young woman and every\
5:27\
young man ... to enlist in the\
youth battalion of the Lord\
5:30\
to help gather Israel."\
5:32\
And all of us are grateful\
to take up the prophetic call\
5:37\
to profess the name of His\
restored Church as revealed\
5:40\
by the Savior Himself:\
The Church of Jesus\
5:44\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
5:47\
In the process of taking\
the Savior's name upon us,\
5:50\
we must understand\
that the cause\
5:52\
of Christ and of His Church\
are one and the same.\
5:56\
They cannot be separated.\
5:59\
Similarly, our personal\
discipleship to the Savior\
6:03\
and active membership in His\
Church are also inseparable.\
6:08\
If we falter in our\
commitment to one,\
6:12\
our commitment to the\
other will be diminished,\
6:15\
as surely as night follows day.\
6:19\
Some are reluctant\
to assume the name\
6:21\
of Jesus Christ and\
His cause because they\
6:23\
regard it to be unduly narrow,\
limiting, and confining.\
6:28\
In reality, taking upon\
us the name of Christ\
6:31\
is both liberating\
and enlarging.\
6:34\
It awakens the desire we felt\
when we accepted God's plan\
6:37\
through faith in the Savior.\
6:39\
With this desire\
alive in our hearts,\
6:42\
we can discover the real purpose\
of our divinely given gifts\
6:45\
and talents, experience\
His empowering love,\
6:49\
and grow in our concern\
for the welfare of others.\
6:52\
As we take upon us\
the Savior's name,\
6:56\
we truly lay hold\
upon every good thing.\
7:01\
It is important to remember that\
taking the Savior's name upon\
7:04\
us is a covenant\
commitment--beginning with\
7:07\
the covenant we make at baptism.\
7:10\
President Nelson has taught,\
"[Our] commitment to follow\
7:14\
the Savior by making covenants\
with Him and then keeping those\
7:18\
covenants will open the door\
to every spiritual blessing\
7:21\
and privilege available."\
7:24\
One of the supernal privileges\
of taking the Savior's name\
7:27\
upon us by baptism\
is the access it\
7:30\
provides to the next\
ordinance on the covenant\
7:32\
path, our confirmation.\
7:35\
When I asked one of my\
eight-year-old friends\
7:38\
what taking the name\
of Christ meant to her,\
7:41\
she replied simply, "It means\
I can have the Holy Ghost."\
7:46\
She was right.\
7:48\
The gift of the Holy Ghost\
is received by confirmation\
7:51\
after we have received\
the ordinance of baptism.\
7:54\
This gift is the\
right and opportunity\
7:58\
to have the Holy Ghost\
as a constant companion.\
8:01\
If we listen to and obey\
His still, small voice,\
8:05\
He will keep us on\
the covenant path\
8:07\
we entered through\
baptism, warn us\
8:10\
when we are tempted\
to depart from it,\
8:12\
and encourage us to repent\
and adjust as necessary.\
8:16\
Our focus after baptism is\
to keep the Holy Ghost always\
8:21\
with us so that we can continue\
progressing along the covenant\
8:25\
path.\
8:26\
The Holy Ghost can\
be with us only\
8:29\
to the degree we keep our\
lives clean and free from sin.\
8:33\
For this reason, the Lord\
has provided a way for us\
8:36\
to continually refresh the\
purifying effect of our baptism\
8:41\
through another\
ordinance--the sacrament.\
8:44\
Each week, we can "witness ...\
that [we] are willing to take\
8:49\
upon [us] the name of [the]\
Son" again by reaching out\
8:54\
and taking the emblems of\
the Lord's flesh and blood\
8:57\
in our hands--the bread and the\
water--and partaking of them\
9:01\
into our very souls.\
9:04\
In return, the Savior performs\
His cleansing miracle yet again\
9:09\
and qualifies us to\
have the continuing\
9:11\
influence of the Holy Ghost.\
9:14\
Is this not evidence of the\
infinite mercy found only\
9:19\
in the name of Jesus Christ?\
9:22\
Just as we take\
His name upon us,\
9:25\
He takes our sins\
and sorrows upon Him,\
9:29\
and yet His arm is\
"stretched out still"\
9:32\
to encircle us in\
the arms of His love.\
9:36\
The sacrament is\
a weekly reminder\
9:38\
that taking upon us the\
name of Jesus Christ\
9:41\
is a living and\
continuing commitment,\
9:43\
not a single event\
that happens once\
9:46\
only on the day of our baptism.\
9:49\
We can continually and\
repeatedly enjoy "that sacred\
9:53\
holy off'ring, by\
man least understood,\
9:57\
to have our sins remitted and\
take his flesh and blood."\
10:03\
It is little wonder then that\
whenever the children of God\
10:07\
understand the powerful,\
spiritual blessings that\
10:10\
can come from taking upon\
them the name of Christ,\
10:14\
their feeling is always of\
joy and their desire is always\
10:19\
to enter into a\
covenant with their God.\
10:24\
As we follow this\
divinely designed covenant\
10:26\
path, our commitment\
and efforts to take\
10:28\
upon us the name of\
Jesus Christ will give us\
10:31\
the strength to "retain\
[His] name written always\
10:34\
in [our] hearts."\
10:35\
We will love God\
and our neighbors\
10:37\
and feel a desire\
to minister to them.\
10:40\
We will keep His commandments\
and yearn to draw nearer to Him\
10:43\
by entering into additional\
covenants with Him.\
10:46\
And when we find ourselves\
weak and incapable\
10:49\
to act on our\
righteous desires, we\
10:51\
will plead for the strength that\
comes only through His name,\
10:55\
and He will come to our aid.\
10:58\
As we endure in\
faithfulness, the day\
11:00\
will come when we will\
see Him and be with Him,\
11:05\
and we will find that we\
have become like Him, thus\
11:09\
qualifying us to return to\
the presence of the Father.\
11:12\
For the Savior's\
promise is sure:\
11:15\
those who "believe on\
the name of Jesus Christ,\
11:19\
and worship the\
Father in his name,\
11:22\
and endure in faith on\
his name to the end"\
11:26\
will be saved in\
the kingdom of God.\
11:29\
With you, I rejoice that\
these incomparable blessings\
11:33\
are made possible by taking\
upon us the name of Jesus\
11:37\
Christ, of whom and in\
whose name I testify, amen.\
