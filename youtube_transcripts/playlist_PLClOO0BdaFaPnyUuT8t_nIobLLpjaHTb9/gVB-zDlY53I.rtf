My brothers and sisters, my\
talk was prepared some time\
0:05\
before the passing of\
my dear wife, Barbara.\
0:09\
My family and I thank you for\
your love and your outreach\
0:14\
and kindness.\
0:15\
I pray the Lord will bless me\
as I speak to you this morning.\
0:21\
In October 1918, 100 years\
ago, President Joseph F. Smith\
0:28\
received a glorious vision.\
0:31\
After almost 65 years of\
dedicated service to the Lord\
0:36\
in The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints,\
0:39\
and just a few weeks before\
his death on November 19, 1918,\
0:46\
he sat in his room pondering\
Christ's atoning sacrifice\
0:50\
and reading the Apostle\
Peter's description\
0:54\
of the Savior's ministry\
in the spirit world\
0:57\
after His Crucifixion.\
1:00\
He recorded: "As I read\
I was greatly impressed.\
1:05\
...\
1:06\
As I pondered over\
these things ...\
1:08\
the eyes of my\
understanding were opened,\
1:11\
and the Spirit of the\
Lord rested upon me,\
1:14\
and I saw the\
hosts of the dead."\
1:17\
The full text of the vision\
is recorded in Doctrine\
1:22\
and Covenants section 138.\
1:26\
Let me provide some background\
so that we may more fully\
1:30\
appreciate Joseph F.'s\
lifetime of preparation\
1:35\
to receive this\
remarkable revelation.\
1:39\
When he was President\
of the Church,\
1:41\
he visited Nauvoo in\
1906 and reflected\
1:46\
on a memory he had when he\
was just five years old.\
1:51\
He said: "This is\
the exact spot where\
1:54\
I stood when [Joseph, my\
uncle, and my father, Hyrum]\
1:59\
came riding up on\
their way to Carthage.\
2:03\
Without getting off his horse\
father leaned over [from]\
2:11\
his saddle and picked\
me up off the ground.\
2:14\
He kissed me goodbye\
and put me down again\
2:18\
and I saw him ride away."\
2:21\
The next time\
Joseph F. saw them,\
2:24\
his mother, Mary\
Fielding, lifted him up\
2:28\
to see the martyrs\
lying side by side\
2:31\
after being brutally murdered in\
Carthage Jail on June 27, 1844.\
2:39\
Two years later, Joseph\
F., along with his family\
2:43\
and faithful mother,\
Mary Fielding Smith,\
2:45\
left his home in Nauvoo\
for Winter Quarters.\
2:49\
Although not yet 8\
years old, Joseph F.\
2:54\
was required to drive\
one of the ox teams\
2:57\
from Montrose, Iowa,\
to Winter Quarters\
3:01\
and then later on to\
the Salt Lake Valley,\
3:04\
arriving when he was almost 10.\
3:07\
I hope you boys and\
young men are listening\
3:12\
and will realize the\
responsibility and expectation\
3:16\
placed on Joseph F.\
during his boyhood.\
3:21\
Just four years later,\
in 1852, when he was 13,\
3:26\
his beloved mother died--leaving\
Joseph and his siblings\
3:31\
orphans.\
3:32\
Joseph F. was called\
to serve a mission\
3:35\
in the Hawaiian Islands in\
1854 when he was 15 years old.\
3:41\
This mission, which lasted\
more than three years,\
3:46\
was the beginning of a life\
of service in the Church.\
3:51\
Upon his return to Utah,\
Joseph F. married in 1859.\
3:56\
For the next few\
years, his life was\
3:59\
filled with work, family\
duties, two additional missions.\
4:03\
And on July 1, 1866,\
at the age of 27,\
4:09\
Joseph F.'s life\
was forever changed\
4:12\
when he was ordained an Apostle\
by President Brigham Young.\
4:17\
In October the following\
year, he filled a vacancy\
4:22\
in the Council of the Twelve.\
4:24\
He served as a counselor to\
Brigham Young, John Taylor,\
4:30\
Wilford Woodruff,\
and Lorenzo Snow\
4:33\
before becoming President\
himself in 1901.\
4:39\
Joseph F. and his wife Julina\
welcomed their first child,\
4:45\
Mercy Josephine,\
into the family.\
4:48\
She was only two and a half\
years old when she passed away.\
4:52\
Shortly after,\
Joseph F. recorded:\
4:55\
"It is one month yesterday since\
my ... darling Josephine died.\
5:01\
O!\
5:02\
that I could have saved her\
to grow up to womanhood.\
5:06\
I miss her every day\
and I am lonely. ...\
5:09\
God forgive my weakness\
if it is wrong to love\
5:13\
my little ones as I love them."\
5:16\
During his lifetime,\
President Smith\
5:19\
lost his father, his mother,\
one brother, two sisters,\
5:24\
two wives, and 13 children.\
5:27\
He was well acquainted with\
sorrow and losing loved ones.\
5:32\
When his son Albert\
Jesse died, Joseph F.\
5:37\
wrote to his sister Martha Ann\
that he had pled with the Lord\
5:41\
to save him and\
asked, "Why is it so?\
5:45\
O. God why had it to be?"\
5:50\
Despite his prayers at the time,\
Joseph F. received no answer\
5:55\
on this matter.\
5:56\
He told Martha Ann that\
"the heavens [seemed like]\
6:00\
brass over our heads" on the\
subject of death and the spirit\
6:05\
world.\
6:06\
Nevertheless, his faith in\
the Lord's eternal promises\
6:10\
was firm and steadfast.\
6:14\
In the Lord's due time, the\
additional answers, comfort,\
6:18\
and understanding\
about the spirit world\
6:21\
he sought came to\
President Smith\
6:24\
through a marvelous vision\
he received in October 1918.\
6:32\
That year was particularly\
painful for him.\
6:35\
He grieved over the death\
toll of the Great World War\
6:40\
that continued to climb up\
over 20 million people that\
6:45\
were killed.\
6:46\
Additionally, a flu pandemic\
was spreading around the world,\
6:51\
taking the lives of as\
many as 100 million people.\
6:57\
During this year,\
President Smith\
6:59\
also lost three more\
precious family members.\
7:02\
Elder Hyrum Mack Smith of the\
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,\
7:08\
his firstborn son\
and my grandfather,\
7:11\
died suddenly of a\
ruptured appendix.\
7:16\
President Smith wrote: "I am\
speechless--[numb] with grief!\
7:21\
...\
7:22\
My heart is broken; and\
flutters for life! ...\
7:25\
O!\
7:26\
I loved him!\
7:27\
I will love him forever more.\
7:29\
And so it is and ever will be\
with all my sons and daughters,\
7:35\
but he is my first born son,\
the first to bring me the joy\
7:39\
and hope of an endless,\
honorable name among men. ...\
7:43\
From the depths of my\
soul I thank God for him!\
7:48\
But ...\
7:49\
O!\
7:49\
I needed him!\
7:51\
We all needed him!\
7:53\
He was most useful\
to the Church.\
7:56\
...\
7:57\
And now ...\
7:58\
O!\
7:58\
what can I do!\
8:00\
O!\
8:01\
God help me!"\
8:04\
The next month, President\
Smith's son-in-law,\
8:07\
Alonzo Kesler, died\
in a tragic accident.\
8:11\
President Smith\
noted in his journal,\
8:13\
"This most terrible and\
heart-rending fatal accident,\
8:17\
has again cast a pall of gloom\
over all [of] my family."\
8:23\
Seven months later,\
in September 1918,\
8:27\
President Smith's\
daughter-in-law\
8:30\
and my grandmother,\
Ida Bowman Smith,\
8:33\
died after giving birth to her\
fifth child, my Uncle Hyrum.\
8:40\
And so it was on\
October 3, 1918,\
8:45\
having experienced intense\
sorrow over the millions\
8:49\
who had died in the world\
through war and disease\
8:54\
as well as the deaths of\
his own family members,\
8:57\
President Smith received\
the heavenly revelation\
9:01\
known as "the vision of the\
redemption of the dead."\
9:08\
He alluded to the\
revelation the following day\
9:11\
in the opening session\
of general conference.\
9:14\
President Smith's health was\
failing, yet he spoke briefly.\
9:20\
He said: "I will\
not, I dare not,\
9:25\
attempt to enter upon\
[the] many things\
9:28\
that are resting upon\
my mind this morning,\
9:31\
and I shall postpone\
until some future time,\
9:35\
the Lord be willing, my attempt\
to tell you some of the things\
9:40\
that are in my mind, and\
that dwell in my heart.\
9:44\
I have not lived alone\
these [last] five months.\
9:49\
I have dwelt in the spirit\
of prayer, of supplication,\
9:54\
of faith and of\
determination; and I\
9:58\
have had my communication\
with the Spirit of the Lord\
10:01\
continuously."\
10:04\
The revelation he received on\
October 3 comforted his heart\
10:09\
and provided answers to\
many of his questions.\
10:13\
We too can be comforted and\
learn more about our own future\
10:19\
when we and our loved ones\
die and go to the spirit world\
10:24\
by studying this\
revelation and pondering\
10:28\
its significance in the way\
we live our lives each day.\
10:34\
Among the many things\
President Smith\
10:36\
saw was the Savior's visit\
to the faithful in the spirit\
10:40\
world after His own\
death on the cross.\
10:44\
From the vision I quote:\
10:48\
"But behold, from\
among the righteous,\
10:50\
he organized his forces and\
appointed messengers, clothed\
10:55\
with power and authority,\
and commissioned\
10:59\
them to go forth and carry the\
light of the gospel to them\
11:03\
that were in darkness, even\
to all the spirits of men\
11:07\
[and women]; and thus was the\
gospel preached to the dead.\
11:12\
...\
11:12\
"These were taught\
faith in God, repentance\
11:17\
from sin, vicarious [baptisms\
and] remission [for]\
11:21\
sins, the gift of the Holy\
Ghost by the laying on of hands,\
11:27\
"And all other principles of\
the gospel that were necessary\
11:31\
for them to know in order to\
qualify themselves that they\
11:36\
might be judged according\
to men in the flesh,\
11:39\
but live according to\
God in the spirit. ...\
11:44\
"For the dead had looked\
upon the long absence\
11:47\
of their spirits from\
their bodies as a bondage.\
11:52\
"These the Lord taught,\
and gave them power\
11:56\
to come forth, after his\
resurrection from the dead,\
12:00\
to enter into his\
Father's kingdom,\
12:03\
there to be crowned with\
immortality and eternal life,\
12:09\
"And continue\
thenceforth their labor\
12:12\
as had been promised\
by the Lord,\
12:15\
and be partakers of\
all blessings which\
12:20\
were held in reserve\
for them that love him."\
12:26\
In the vision, President\
Smith saw his father, Hyrum,\
12:31\
and the Prophet Joseph Smith.\
12:34\
It had been 74 years since\
he had last seen them\
12:40\
as a small boy in Nauvoo.\
12:42\
We can only imagine his joy\
at seeing his beloved father\
12:48\
and uncle.\
12:49\
He must have been\
inspired and comforted\
12:53\
to know that all spirits\
retain the likeness\
12:57\
of their mortal body and\
that they are anxiously\
13:01\
awaiting the day of their\
promised resurrection.\
13:05\
The vision revealed more\
fully the depth and breadth\
13:10\
of Heavenly Father's\
plan for His children\
13:13\
and Christ's redeeming\
love and matchless\
13:19\
power of His Atonement.\
13:22\
On this special\
100th anniversary,\
13:25\
I invite you to thoroughly\
read and thoughtfully read\
13:30\
the revelation.\
13:32\
As you do so, may the Lord\
bless you to more fully\
13:37\
understand and appreciate God's\
love, His plan of salvation\
13:44\
and happiness for His children.\
13:48\
I testify that the vision\
President Joseph F.\
13:52\
Smith received is true.\
13:54\
I bear witness that every\
person can read it and come\
13:59\
to know it is true.\
14:01\
Those who do not receive\
this knowledge in this life\
14:06\
will surely come to\
know of its truthfulness\
14:12\
when everyone will arrive\
in the spirit world.\
14:17\
There, all will love and praise\
God and the Lord Jesus Christ\
14:25\
for the great plan of salvation,\
the blessing of the promised\
14:30\
resurrection, when\
body and spirit\
14:34\
will once again be united\
never to be separated again.\
14:40\
How grateful I am today,\
my brothers and sisters,\
14:44\
to know where my\
precious Barbara is\
14:47\
and that we will\
be together again\
14:50\
with our family\
for all eternity.\
14:54\
May the peace of the\
Lord sustain all of us\
14:59\
now and forever is\
my humble prayer,\
15:03\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
