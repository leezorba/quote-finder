In 1981 my father, two\
close friends, and I\
0:05\
went on an adventure in Alaska.\
0:07\
We were to land on a\
remote lake and climb\
0:09\
to some beautiful high country.\
0:11\
In order to reduce the load we\
would have to personally carry,\
0:15\
we wrapped our supplies in\
boxes, covered them with foam,\
0:19\
attached large\
colored streamers,\
0:21\
and threw them out the\
window of our bush plane\
0:24\
at our intended destination.\
0:26\
After arriving, we searched and\
searched, but to our dismay,\
0:30\
we could not find\
any of the boxes.\
0:33\
Eventually we found one.\
0:34\
It contained a small gas\
stove, a tarp, some candy,\
0:39\
and a couple packages of\
Hamburger Helper--but no\
0:42\
hamburger.\
0:43\
We had no way to communicate\
with the outside world,\
0:47\
and our scheduled\
pickup was a week later.\
0:50\
I learned two valuable\
lessons from this experience:\
0:52\
One, do not throw your\
food out the window.\
0:55\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:58\
Two, sometimes we have\
to face hard things.\
1:01\
Frequently our first reaction\
to hard things is "Why me?"\
1:05\
Asking why, however, never\
takes away the hard thing.\
1:08\
The Lord requires that\
we overcome challenges,\
1:11\
and He has indicated "that\
all these things shall\
1:14\
give [us] experience, and\
shall be for [our] good."\
1:18\
Sometimes the Lord asks\
us to do a hard thing,\
1:21\
and sometimes our\
challenges are created\
1:23\
by our own or others'\
use of agency.\
1:26\
Nephi experienced both\
of these situations.\
1:29\
When Lehi invited\
his sons to return\
1:32\
to get the plates from Laban,\
he said, "Behold thy brothers\
1:36\
murmur, saying it is a hard\
thing which I have required\
1:39\
of them; but behold I have\
not required it of them,\
1:42\
but it is a commandment\
of the Lord."\
1:44\
On another occasion,\
Nephi's brothers\
1:47\
used their agency to limit\
his: "They did lay their hands\
1:51\
upon me, for behold, they\
were exceedingly wroth,\
1:54\
and they did bind me\
with cords, for they\
1:57\
sought to take away my life."\
1:59\
Joseph Smith confronted a\
hard thing in Liberty Jail.\
2:02\
With no relief in\
sight and in despair,\
2:05\
Joseph cried out, "O\
God, where art thou?"\
2:08\
No doubt some of us\
have felt as Joseph did.\
2:13\
EVERYONE FACES HARD\
THINGS: the death\
2:15\
of a loved one, divorce,\
a wayward child, illness,\
2:19\
trials of faith, a lost job,\
or any other difficulty.\
2:24\
I was forever changed\
upon hearing these words\
2:27\
from Elder Neal A. Maxwell\
of the Quorum of the Twelve,\
2:29\
spoken in the midst of his\
struggle with leukemia.\
2:33\
He said, "I was doing some\
pensive pondering and these 13\
2:38\
instructive and reassuring\
words came into my mind:\
2:41\
'I have given you leukemia that\
you might teach my people with\
2:45\
authenticity.'" He then went on\
to express how this experience\
2:48\
had blessed him with\
"perspective about the great\
2:52\
realities of eternity.\
2:53\
...\
2:53\
Such glimpses of\
eternity can help\
2:56\
us to travel the next 100 yards,\
which may be very difficult."\
3:00\
To help us travel and\
triumph over our hard times\
3:03\
with such glimpses of eternity,\
may I suggest two things.\
3:07\
We must face hard things,\
first, by forgiving\
3:10\
others, and second, by giving\
ourselves to Heavenly Father.\
3:16\
Forgiving those who may\
have caused our hard thing\
3:19\
and reconciling "[our]selves\
to the will of God"\
3:21\
can be very difficult. It can\
hurt most when our hard thing\
3:25\
is caused by a family\
member, a close friend,\
3:28\
or even ourselves.\
3:30\
As a young bishop, I\
learned of forgiveness\
3:32\
when my stake president,\
Bruce M. Cook,\
3:35\
shared the following story.\
3:37\
He explained:\
3:39\
"During the late 1970s,\
some associates and I\
3:41\
started a business.\
3:43\
Although we did nothing\
illegal, some poor decisions,\
3:46\
combined with ...\
challenging economic times,\
3:48\
resulted in our failure.\
3:50\
"Some investors filed a lawsuit\
to recover their losses.\
3:53\
Their attorney happened to\
be a counselor in my family's\
3:56\
bishopric.\
3:57\
It was very difficult to\
sustain the man who seemed\
4:00\
to be seeking to destroy me.\
4:02\
I developed some real\
animosity toward him\
4:05\
and considered him my enemy.\
4:07\
After five years\
of legal battles,\
4:09\
we lost everything we\
owned, including our home.\
4:13\
"In 2002, my wife and I learned\
that the stake presidency\
4:16\
in which I served as a\
counselor was being reorganized.\
4:19\
As we traveled on a short\
vacation prior to the release,\
4:22\
she asked me whom I would\
choose as my counselors\
4:26\
if I were called as the\
new stake president.\
4:28\
I did not want to speak\
about it, but she persisted.\
4:32\
Eventually, one name\
came to ... mind.\
4:34\
She then mentioned the\
name of the attorney\
4:36\
we considered to have been at\
the center of our difficulties\
4:39\
20 years earlier.\
4:41\
As she spoke, the\
Spirit confirmed that he\
4:43\
should be the other counselor.\
4:44\
Could I forgive the man?\
4:47\
"When Elder David E. Sorensen\
extended to me the call\
4:50\
to serve as [the]\
stake president,\
4:51\
he gave me an hour\
to select counselors.\
4:54\
Through tears, I indicated ...\
the Lord had already provided\
4:57\
that revelation.\
4:58\
As I spoke the name of the\
man I had considered my enemy,\
5:01\
the anger, animosity, and hate\
I had harbored disappeared.\
5:05\
In that moment, I\
learned of the peace\
5:07\
that comes with forgiveness\
through the Atonement\
5:09\
of Christ."\
5:10\
In other words,\
my stake president\
5:12\
did "frankly forgive"\
him, like Nephi of old.\
5:14\
I knew President Cook\
and his counselor\
5:18\
as two righteous priesthood\
leaders who loved one another.\
5:22\
I determined to be like them.\
5:24\
Years before, during our\
misadventure in Alaska,\
5:27\
I had quickly learned that\
blaming our circumstances\
5:30\
on others--the pilot launching\
the food out in fading\
5:33\
light--was not a solution.\
5:35\
However, we experienced\
physical exhaustion and lack\
5:39\
of food, sickness, and\
sleeping on the ground\
5:41\
during a major storm with\
only a tarp to cover us.\
5:44\
I learned that "with God\
nothing shall be impossible."\
5:48\
Young people, God requires\
hard things of you.\
5:51\
One 14-year-old young\
woman participated\
5:54\
in competitive basketball.\
5:55\
She dreamed of playing\
high school basketball\
5:58\
like her older sister.\
5:59\
She then learned\
that her parents\
6:00\
had been called to preside\
over a mission in Guatemala.\
6:04\
Upon arrival, she discovered\
that a couple of her classes\
6:07\
would be in Spanish, a\
language she did not yet speak.\
6:10\
There was not a single girls'\
sports team at her school.\
6:14\
She lived on the 14th floor of\
a building with tight security.\
6:17\
And to top it all off, she\
could not go outside alone\
6:20\
for safety reasons.\
6:22\
Her parents listened to\
her cry herself to sleep\
6:25\
every night for months.\
6:26\
This broke their hearts!\
6:28\
They finally decided\
they would send her home\
6:30\
to her grandmother\
for high school.\
6:33\
When my mother entered\
our daughter's room\
6:35\
to tell her our decision,\
she saw our daughter kneeling\
6:39\
in prayer with the Book\
of Mormon open on the bed.\
6:41\
The Spirit whispered to\
my wife, "She will be OK,"\
6:44\
and my wife quietly\
left the room.\
6:47\
We never heard her cry\
herself to sleep again.\
6:50\
With determination\
and the Lord's help,\
6:51\
she faced those three\
years valiantly.\
6:54\
At the conclusion\
of our mission,\
6:55\
I asked my daughter\
if she was going\
6:57\
to serve a full-time mission.\
6:58\
Her answer was "No, Dad,\
I have already served."\
7:03\
I was just fine with that!\
7:04\
[LAUGHTER]\
7:06\
But about six months later, the\
Spirit awoke me in the night\
7:10\
with this thought: "I\
have called your daughter\
7:13\
to serve a mission."\
7:15\
My reaction was "Heavenly\
Father, she has given so much."\
7:18\
I was quickly\
corrected by the Spirit\
7:21\
and came to understand that\
her missionary service was\
7:24\
required of the Lord.\
7:26\
I soon took my\
daughter to lunch.\
7:27\
From across the table,\
I said, "Ganzie,\
7:30\
do you know why we are here?"\
7:33\
She said, "Yes, Dad.\
7:34\
You know I have to\
serve a mission.\
7:36\
I do not want to\
go, but I am going."\
7:40\
Because she gave her\
will to Heavenly Father,\
7:42\
she served Him with all\
her heart, might, mind,\
7:44\
and strength.\
7:45\
She has taught her father\
how to do hard thing.\
7:49\
In President Russell M. Nelson's\
worldwide devotional for youth,\
7:53\
he requested some hard\
things of the youth.\
7:56\
President Nelson said:\
"My fifth invitation\
7:58\
is for you to stand out; be\
different from the world.\
8:02\
...\
8:02\
The Lord needs you to look\
like, sound like, act like,\
8:06\
and dress like a true\
disciple of Jesus Christ."\
8:09\
That can be a hard thing, yet\
I know you can do it--with joy.\
8:14\
Remember that "men are,\
that they might have joy."\
8:16\
With all that Lehi faced,\
he still found joy.\
8:20\
Remember when Alma was "weighed\
down with sorrow" because\
8:22\
of the people of Ammonihah?\
8:24\
The angel told him, "Blessed\
art thou, Alma; therefore,\
8:28\
lift up thy head\
and rejoice, ...\
8:30\
for thou hast been faithful\
in keeping the commandments\
8:32\
of God."\
8:33\
Alma learned a great truth:\
we can always rejoice\
8:36\
when we keep the commandments.\
8:38\
Remember that during the\
wars and challenges faced\
8:41\
during the time\
of Captain Moroni,\
8:43\
"there never was a happier time\
among the people of Nephi."\
8:46\
We can and should find joy\
when we face hard things.\
8:51\
THE SAVIOR FACED HARD\
THINGS: "The world ...\
8:53\
shall judge him to\
be a thing of naught;\
8:55\
wherefore they scourge him,\
and he suffereth it; ...\
8:58\
they smite him, and\
he suffereth it.\
9:01\
Yea, they spit upon him,\
and he suffereth it,\
9:04\
because of his loving kindness\
and his long-suffering\
9:07\
towards the children of men."\
9:09\
Because of that\
loving-kindness, Jesus Christ\
9:11\
suffered the Atonement.\
9:13\
As a result, He says to each\
one of us, "In the world\
9:16\
ye shall have tribulation:\
but be of good cheer;\
9:19\
I have overcome the world."\
9:21\
Because of Christ, we too\
can overcome the world.\
9:25\
As we face hard things\
in the Lord's way, may\
9:28\
we lift up our\
heads and rejoice.\
9:30\
At this sacred opportunity\
to testify to the world,\
9:33\
I proclaim that our Savior\
lives and guides His Church.\
9:37\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
