Brothers and sisters,\
my uncle Morrell\
0:04\
comes from a family\
of 11 children,\
0:07\
and he was always\
one of my favorites\
0:10\
and always set a\
wonderful example for me.\
0:13\
And I love him very\
much and look forward\
0:17\
to the day when\
I'll see him again.\
0:20\
Many people today wonder\
about the reality of God\
0:24\
and our relationship to Him.\
0:26\
Many know little or nothing\
at all about His great plan\
0:30\
of happiness.\
0:31\
More than 30 years ago,\
President Ezra Taft Benson\
0:35\
observed that "much of the\
... world today rejects\
0:38\
the divinity of the Savior.\
0:40\
They question His miraculous\
birth, His perfect life,\
0:44\
and the reality of His\
glorious resurrection."\
0:48\
In our day, questions are\
focused not only on our Savior\
0:52\
but also on His Church--The\
Church of Jesus Christ\
0:55\
of Latter-day Saints--which He\
restored through the Prophet\
0:58\
Joseph Smith.\
0:59\
These questions often focus\
on the history, teachings,\
1:04\
or practices of the\
Savior's Church.\
1:08\
FROM PREACH MY GOSPEL\
WE READ: "Remember that\
1:10\
our understanding [of\
Heavenly Father and His plan\
1:13\
of happiness] comes from modern\
prophets--Joseph Smith and his\
1:17\
successors--who receive\
direct revelation from God.\
1:21\
Therefore, the first\
question someone\
1:24\
should answer is whether\
Joseph Smith was a prophet,\
1:27\
and he or she can answer this\
question by reading and praying\
1:32\
about the Book of Mormon."\
1:34\
The testimony of the divine\
calling of the Prophet Joseph\
1:37\
Smith has been\
strengthened by prayerfully\
1:40\
studying the Book of Mormon:\
Another Testament of Jesus\
1:44\
Christ.\
1:45\
I have acted on\
Moroni's invitation\
1:47\
to "ask God, the Eternal\
Father, in the name of Christ,"\
1:51\
to know of the truthfulness\
of the Book of Mormon.\
1:54\
I bear witness that\
I know it is true.\
1:56\
That knowledge has\
come to me, as it\
1:59\
can come to you, "by the\
power of the Holy Ghost."\
2:02\
The introduction to\
the Book of Mormon\
2:04\
states: "Those who gain\
this divine witness\
2:07\
[of the Book of Mormon]\
from the Holy Spirit\
2:09\
will also come to\
know by the same power\
2:12\
that Jesus Christ is the Savior\
of the world, that Joseph\
2:16\
Smith is His revelator and\
prophet in these last days,\
2:20\
and that The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
2:23\
is the Lord's kingdom once\
again established on the earth,\
2:26\
preparatory to the Second\
Coming of the Messiah."\
2:31\
As a young missionary\
going to Chile,\
2:33\
I learned a life-changing lesson\
about the conversion power\
2:36\
of the Book of Mormon.\
2:38\
Mr. Gonzalez served in\
a respected position\
2:41\
in his church for many years.\
2:43\
He had extensive\
religious training,\
2:45\
including a degree in theology.\
2:47\
He was quite proud of\
his biblical expertise.\
2:51\
It was obvious to us that\
he was a religious scholar.\
2:55\
He was well aware\
of the missionaries\
2:57\
of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
3:00\
as they went about their work\
in his home city of Lima, Peru.\
3:03\
He always wanted to meet\
with them so that he\
3:06\
could school them in the Bible.\
3:10\
One day, almost as a gift\
from heaven, so he thought,\
3:13\
two missionaries stopped\
him in the street\
3:16\
and asked if they\
could come to his home\
3:18\
and share the\
scriptures with him.\
3:20\
This was his dream come true!\
3:22\
His prayers had been answered.\
3:23\
Finally, he could set these\
misguided young boys straight.\
3:28\
He told them that he\
would be delighted to have\
3:30\
them come to his house and\
discuss the scriptures.\
3:34\
He could hardly wait\
for his appointment.\
3:37\
He was ready to use the Bible\
to disprove their beliefs.\
3:40\
He was confident that the Bible\
would clearly and articulately\
3:44\
point out the error\
of their ways.\
3:47\
The appointed night came,\
and the missionaries\
3:50\
knocked on the door.\
3:51\
He was giddy.\
3:52\
The moment had finally arrived.\
3:55\
He opened the door and invited\
the missionaries into his home.\
3:58\
One of the missionaries\
handed him a blue book\
4:01\
and bore a sincere testimony\
that he knew the book contained\
4:04\
the word of God.\
4:06\
The second missionary added his\
powerful testimony of the book,\
4:10\
testifying that it\
had been translated\
4:12\
by a modern prophet of\
God, named Joseph Smith,\
4:16\
and that it taught of Christ.\
4:18\
The missionaries excused\
themselves and left his home.\
4:21\
Mr. Gonzalez was\
so disappointed.\
4:24\
[LAUGHTER]\
4:26\
But he opened the\
book and he started\
4:28\
to leaf though its pages.\
4:30\
He read the first page.\
4:31\
He read page after\
page after page\
4:34\
and didn't stop until late into\
the afternoon of the next day.\
4:38\
He read the whole book\
and knew that it was true.\
4:42\
He knew what he had to do.\
4:44\
He called the missionaries,\
received the lessons,\
4:47\
and gave up the life\
that he had known\
4:49\
to become a member of The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
4:52\
Saints.\
4:53\
That good man was my MTC\
teacher in Provo, Utah.\
4:57\
Brother Gonzalez's\
conversion story\
5:00\
and the power of\
the Book of Mormon\
5:01\
made a great impression on me.\
5:03\
When I arrived in Chile,\
my mission president,\
5:06\
President Royden J.\
Glade, invited us to read\
5:09\
the testimony of the Prophet\
Joseph Smith recorded in Joseph\
5:13\
Smith--History every week.\
5:15\
He taught us that a\
testimony of the First Vision\
5:18\
would have a direct correlation\
to our own testimony\
5:21\
of the gospel and our testimony\
of the Book of Mormon.\
5:25\
I took his invitation seriously.\
5:27\
I have read the accounts\
of the First Vision;\
5:31\
I have read the Book of Mormon.\
5:32\
I have prayed as\
directed by Moroni\
5:35\
and asked "God, the Eternal\
Father, in the name of Christ"\
5:39\
if the Book of Mormon is true.\
5:41\
I bear witness today that\
I know the Book of Mormon,\
5:45\
as the Prophet Joseph Smith\
said, is "the most correct\
5:48\
of any book on earth, and\
the keystone of our religion,\
5:52\
and a man [will] get nearer to\
God by abiding by its precepts,\
5:55\
than by any other book."\
5:57\
The Prophet Joseph also\
declared: "Take away\
6:00\
the Book of Mormon\
and the revelations,\
6:02\
and where is our religion?\
6:04\
We have none."\
6:06\
As we better\
understand who we are\
6:07\
and the purposes of\
the Book of Mormon,\
6:09\
our conversion deepens\
and becomes more certain.\
6:12\
We are strengthened\
in our commitment\
6:14\
to keep the covenants\
we have made with God.\
6:18\
A principal purpose\
of the Book of Mormon\
6:20\
is to gather scattered Israel.\
6:22\
This gathering gives\
all of God's children\
6:25\
the opportunity to enter\
into the covenant path\
6:28\
and, by honoring\
those covenants,\
6:30\
return back to the\
presence of the Father.\
6:32\
As we teach repentance\
and baptize converts,\
6:36\
we gather scattered Israel.\
6:39\
The Book of Mormon\
has 108 references\
6:42\
to the house of Israel.\
6:44\
At the beginning of\
the Book of Mormon,\
6:46\
Nephi taught, "For\
the fulness of mine\
6:50\
intent is that I\
may persuade men\
6:52\
to come unto the God of\
Abraham, and the God of Isaac,\
6:56\
and the God of\
Jacob, and be saved."\
6:58\
The God of Abraham,\
Isaac, and Jacob\
7:01\
is Jesus Christ, the God\
of the Old Testament.\
7:04\
We are saved as we\
come unto Christ\
7:07\
through living His gospel.\
7:10\
LATER, NEPHI WROTE: "Yea, even\
my father spake much concerning\
7:15\
the Gentiles, and also\
concerning the house of Israel,\
7:18\
that they should be compared\
like unto an olive tree,\
7:21\
whose branches should be broken\
off and should be scattered\
7:24\
upon all the face\
of the earth. ...\
7:26\
"And after the house of\
Israel should be scattered\
7:29\
they should be gathered\
together again; or, in fine,\
7:32\
after the Gentiles had received\
the fulness of the Gospel,\
7:35\
the natural branches\
of the olive tree,\
7:38\
or the remnants of the house of\
Israel, should be grafted in,\
7:41\
or come to the knowledge of\
the true Messiah, their Lord\
7:45\
and their Redeemer."\
7:47\
Likewise, at the end\
of the Book of Mormon,\
7:49\
the prophet Moroni reminds\
us of our covenants,\
7:52\
saying, "That thou mayest\
no more be confounded,\
7:56\
that the covenants of the\
Eternal Father which he hath\
7:59\
made unto thee, O house of\
Israel, may be fulfilled."\
8:03\
What are the "covenants\
of the Eternal Father"\
8:05\
referred to by Moroni?\
8:07\
We read in the book of Abraham:\
8:10\
"My name is Jehovah, and I know\
the end from the beginning;\
8:13\
therefore my hand\
shall be over thee.\
8:16\
"And I will make of\
thee a great nation,\
8:18\
and I will bless\
thee above measure,\
8:20\
and make thy name great\
among all nations,\
8:23\
and thou shalt be a blessing\
unto thy seed after thee,\
8:26\
that in their hands they\
shall bear this ministry\
8:29\
and Priesthood\
unto all nations."\
8:32\
President Russell\
M. Nelson taught\
8:34\
in a recent worldwide\
broadcast that "these surely\
8:38\
are the latter\
days, and the Lord\
8:40\
is hastening His work\
to gather Israel.\
8:42\
That gathering is the\
most important thing\
8:45\
taking place on earth today.\
8:47\
Nothing else compares\
in magnitude,\
8:49\
nothing else compares in\
importance, nothing else\
8:53\
compares in majesty.\
8:54\
And if you choose\
to, if you want to,\
8:57\
you can be a big part of it.\
8:59\
You can be a big part of\
something big, something grand,\
9:03\
something majestic!\
9:05\
"When we speak of the\
gathering, we are simply\
9:07\
saying this fundamental truth:\
every one of our Heavenly\
9:11\
Father's children, on\
both sides of the veil,\
9:14\
deserves to hear the\
message of the restored\
9:17\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
9:18\
They decide for themselves\
if they want to know more."\
9:24\
That is what we are\
doing as members\
9:26\
of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints:\
9:29\
we are seeking to\
bring the world\
9:31\
to an understanding\
and a conversion\
9:33\
to the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
9:35\
We are the "latter-day\
gatherers."\
9:38\
Our mission is clear.\
9:40\
Brothers and sisters,\
let us be known\
9:43\
as those who have taken\
Moroni's promise to heart,\
9:46\
prayed and received an answer\
to know that the Book of Mormon\
9:50\
is true, and then shared that\
knowledge with others in word\
9:54\
and, most importantly, in deed.\
9:57\
The Book of Mormon contains the\
fulness of the gospel of Jesus\
10:00\
Christ; it leads us to the\
covenants of the Father,\
10:03\
which if kept will assure us\
of His greatest gift--eternal\
10:08\
life.\
10:08\
The Book of Mormon\
is the keystone\
10:10\
to conversion of all of Heavenly\
Father's sons and daughters.\
10:15\
Quoting again from President\
Nelson: "As you ...\
10:18\
read daily ... the\
Book of Mormon,\
10:20\
you will learn the\
doctrine of the gathering,\
10:22\
truths about Jesus\
Christ, His Atonement,\
10:26\
and the fulness of His gospel\
not found in the Bible.\
10:29\
The Book of Mormon is central\
to the gathering of Israel.\
10:33\
In fact, if there were\
no Book of Mormon,\
10:36\
the promised gathering of\
Israel would not occur."\
10:41\
Let me conclude with\
the words of the Savior\
10:43\
as He taught the Nephites\
of the promised blessings:\
10:46\
"Ye are the children\
of the prophets;\
10:48\
and ye are of the\
house of Israel;\
10:50\
and ye are of the covenant\
which the Father made\
10:52\
with your fathers,\
saying unto Abraham:\
10:55\
And in thy seed shall all\
the kindreds of the earth\
10:58\
be blessed."\
10:59\
I testify that we are\
sons and daughters of God,\
11:03\
the seed of Abraham,\
the house of Israel.\
11:06\
We are gathering Israel for the\
last time and are doing so with\
11:10\
the Book of Mormon--a book\
that, combined with the Spirit\
11:13\
of the Lord, is the most\
powerful tool of conversion.\
11:16\
We are led by the prophet\
of God, President Russell M.\
11:20\
Nelson, who is directing the\
gathering of Israel in our day.\
11:24\
The Book of Mormon is true.\
11:26\
It has changed my life.\
11:28\
I promise you, as have\
Moroni and many prophets\
11:33\
through the ages, that\
it can change yours.\
11:36\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
