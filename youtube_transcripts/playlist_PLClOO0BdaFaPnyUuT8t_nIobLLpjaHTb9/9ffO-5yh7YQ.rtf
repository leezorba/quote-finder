As President Russell M.\
Nelson has just beautifully\
0:04\
and eloquently set\
forth, Church leaders\
0:08\
have been working\
for a long time\
0:10\
on "a home-centered and\
Church-supported plan\
0:14\
to learn doctrine,\
strengthen faith, and foster\
0:18\
greater personal worship."\
0:20\
President Nelson then\
announced an adjustment\
0:23\
to achieve "a new balance\
between gospel instruction\
0:27\
in the home and in the Church."\
0:31\
To accomplish these\
purposes--described\
0:34\
by and under the direction\
of President Russell M.\
0:36\
Nelson and pursuant to the\
decision of the Council\
0:41\
of the First Presidency\
and Quorum of the Twelve\
0:44\
Apostles--the Sunday meeting\
schedule will be adjusted\
0:51\
in the following ways,\
beginning in January 2019.\
0:57\
The Sunday Church\
meetings will consist\
1:00\
of a 60-minute sacrament\
meeting each Sunday focused\
1:05\
on the Savior, the\
ordinance of the sacrament,\
1:08\
and spiritual messages.\
1:11\
After time for\
transition to classes,\
1:15\
Church members will attend\
a 50-minute class that\
1:21\
will alternate each Sunday.\
1:24\
Sunday School will be held on\
the first and third Sundays.\
1:31\
Priesthood quorums,\
Relief Society,\
1:34\
and Young Women\
meetings will be held\
1:37\
on the second and\
fourth Sundays.\
1:41\
Meetings on the\
fifth Sunday will\
1:43\
be under the direction\
of the bishop.\
1:46\
Primary will be held each week\
during this same 50-minute\
1:51\
period and will include\
singing time and classes.\
1:57\
With respect to the\
Sunday meeting schedule,\
2:00\
the senior leaders of the Church\
have been aware for many years\
2:04\
that for some of our precious\
members, a three-hour Sunday\
2:09\
schedule at church\
can be difficult.\
2:12\
This is particularly\
true for parents\
2:14\
with small children, Primary\
children, elderly members,\
2:18\
new converts, and others.\
2:21\
But there is so much\
more to this adjustment\
2:23\
than just shortening the\
Sunday meetinghouse schedule.\
2:28\
President Nelson\
has acknowledged\
2:30\
with gratitude how much\
is being accomplished\
2:33\
as a result of your faithfulness\
to previous invitations.\
2:37\
He and the entire\
leadership of the Church\
2:40\
desire to bring greater gospel\
joy to parents, children,\
2:45\
youth, singles, the elderly,\
new converts, and those people\
2:51\
the missionaries\
are teaching through\
2:54\
a home-centered,\
Church-supported balanced\
2:57\
effort.\
2:58\
The purposes and\
blessings associated\
3:01\
with this adjustment\
and other recent changes\
3:04\
include the following:\
3:07\
Deepening conversion to Heavenly\
Father and the Lord Jesus\
3:10\
Christ and strengthening\
faith in Them.\
3:13\
Strengthening\
individuals and families\
3:16\
through home-centered,\
Church-supported curriculum\
3:20\
that contributes to\
joyful gospel living.\
3:24\
Honoring the Sabbath day,\
with a focus on the ordinance\
3:27\
of the sacrament.\
3:29\
Helping all of Heavenly\
Father's children\
3:31\
on both sides of the veil\
through missionary work\
3:34\
and receiving ordinances\
and covenants and blessings\
3:37\
of the temple.\
3:39\
This Sunday schedule\
allows more time\
3:42\
for a home evening and to study\
the gospel at home on Sunday\
3:47\
or at other times as individuals\
and families may choose.\
3:52\
A family activity\
night could be held\
3:54\
on Monday or at other times.\
3:58\
To this end, leaders\
should continue\
4:01\
to keep Monday evenings\
free from Church meetings\
4:03\
and activities.\
4:04\
However, time spent in\
home evening, gospel study,\
4:08\
and activities for\
individuals and families\
4:11\
may be scheduled according to\
their individual circumstances.\
4:17\
Family and individual\
gospel study at home\
4:19\
will be significantly enhanced\
by a harmonized curriculum\
4:24\
and a new Come, Follow Me\
resource for individuals\
4:28\
and families that is coordinated\
with what is being taught\
4:32\
in Sunday School and Primary.\
4:35\
In January, the Church's\
youth and adult Sunday School\
4:39\
and Primary classes will be\
studying the New Testament.\
4:44\
The new home-study Come, Follow\
Me resource for individuals\
4:49\
and families--also covering\
the New Testament--is designed\
4:54\
to help members learn\
the gospel in the home.\
4:57\
It explains: "This resource is\
for every individual and family\
5:02\
in the Church.\
5:03\
It is designed to help [us\
better] learn the gospel--\
5:06\
whether on [our] own\
or with [our] family.\
5:09\
...\
5:10\
The outlines in this [new]\
resource are organized\
5:13\
according to a\
weekly ... schedule."\
5:17\
The new Primary Come, Follow\
Me lessons taught in church\
5:20\
will follow the same\
weekly schedule.\
5:23\
The adult and youth\
Sunday School classes\
5:25\
on the first and\
third Sundays will\
5:28\
be coordinated so that they\
will support the new Come,\
5:32\
Follow Me home resource.\
5:34\
On the second and\
fourth Sundays,\
5:36\
adults in priesthood\
and Relief Society\
5:38\
will continue to study the\
teachings of Church leaders,\
5:41\
with emphasis on the current\
messages of modern prophets.\
5:46\
Young women and Aaronic\
Priesthood young men\
5:49\
will study gospel\
topics on those Sundays.\
5:52\
The new home-study\
resource provides\
5:55\
"Ideas for Family Scripture\
Study and Family Home Evening."\
5:59\
The outlines for each week\
contain helpful study ideas\
6:03\
and activities for\
individuals and families.\
6:06\
The Come, Follow Me resource\
for individuals and families\
6:10\
also has many\
illustrations that will\
6:13\
help enhance individual and\
family learning, especially\
6:17\
for children.\
6:19\
This new resource will be\
provided to each household\
6:23\
by December of this year.\
6:26\
President Nelson, from\
his initial address\
6:28\
to the members of the\
Church in January,\
6:31\
has exhorted us to\
prepare for the Second\
6:34\
Coming of Jesus Christ by\
walking the covenant path.\
6:38\
World conditions\
increasingly require\
6:41\
deepening individual\
conversion to and strengthening\
6:45\
faith in Heavenly Father and\
Jesus Christ and His Atonement.\
6:49\
The Lord has prepared\
us, line upon line,\
6:52\
for the perilous times\
that we now face.\
6:55\
In recent years,\
the Lord has guided\
6:57\
us to address related\
core concerns, including:\
7:03\
Honoring the Sabbath day\
and the sacred ordinance\
7:06\
of the sacrament,\
which have again\
7:09\
been emphasized for\
the last three years.\
7:12\
Under the bishop's direction,\
strengthened elders quorums\
7:16\
and Relief Societies are focused\
on the purpose of the Church\
7:20\
and helping members make\
and keep sacred covenants.\
7:24\
Ministering in a\
higher and holier way\
7:27\
is being joyfully adopted.\
7:30\
Beginning with the end\
in mind, temple covenants\
7:33\
and family history service\
are becoming a purposeful part\
7:37\
of the covenant path.\
7:40\
The adjustment announced\
this morning is yet\
7:43\
another example of guidance\
for the challenges of our day.\
7:48\
The Church's\
traditional curriculum\
7:50\
has emphasized the\
Sunday church experience.\
7:53\
We know that when we have better\
teaching and more spiritually\
7:56\
prepared class members, we\
have a better Sunday church\
8:00\
experience.\
8:01\
We are blessed that\
often the Spirit\
8:03\
increases and strengthens\
conversion in the church\
8:07\
setting.\
8:08\
The new home-centered and\
Church-supported curriculum\
8:12\
needs to influence\
more powerfully\
8:15\
family religious\
observance and behavior\
8:18\
and personal religious\
observance and behavior.\
8:22\
We know the spiritual impact and\
the deep and lasting conversion\
8:26\
that can be achieved\
in the home setting.\
8:29\
Years ago, a study established\
that for young men and women,\
8:33\
the influence of the\
Holy Ghost most often\
8:36\
accompanies individual scripture\
study and prayer in the home.\
8:41\
Our purpose is to balance the\
Church and the home experience\
8:46\
in a way that will greatly\
increase faith, spirituality,\
8:51\
and deepen conversion to\
Heavenly Father and the Lord\
8:54\
Jesus Christ.\
8:57\
In the home-centered,\
Church-supported portion\
8:59\
of this adjustment, there is\
flexibility for each individual\
9:03\
and family to determine\
prayerfully how and when it\
9:06\
will be implemented.\
9:08\
For example, while this will\
greatly bless all families,\
9:11\
based on local needs,\
it would be completely\
9:15\
appropriate for young singles,\
single adults, single parents,\
9:19\
part-member families,\
new members, and others\
9:22\
to gather in groups outside the\
normal Sunday worship services\
9:27\
to enjoy gospel sociality\
and be strengthened\
9:31\
by studying together the\
home-centered, Church-supported\
9:35\
resource.\
9:36\
This would be\
accomplished informally\
9:39\
by those who so desire.\
9:42\
In many parts of\
the world, people\
9:44\
choose to stay at\
the meetinghouse\
9:46\
after the normal Sunday schedule\
to enjoy social relationships.\
9:50\
There is nothing in this\
announced adjustment that\
9:54\
would interfere with this\
wonderful and rewarding\
9:57\
practice in any way.\
9:59\
To help members prepare\
for the Sabbath,\
10:02\
some wards already send an\
informative email, text,\
10:06\
or social media message midweek.\
10:09\
In view of this\
adjustment, we strongly\
10:12\
recommend this type\
of communication.\
10:14\
These invitations will remind\
the members of the Sunday\
10:17\
meeting schedule for that week,\
including the upcoming class\
10:21\
lesson topic, and support\
continuing gospel conversation\
10:26\
at home.\
10:27\
In addition, the adult\
meetings on Sunday\
10:29\
will also provide information\
to connect church and home\
10:34\
study each week.\
10:36\
The sacrament meeting\
and the class period\
10:38\
will require prayerful\
consideration\
10:41\
to make sure that spiritual\
priorities are emphasized\
10:45\
over administrative functions.\
10:47\
For example, announcements\
can for the most part\
10:52\
be accomplished in\
the midweek invitation\
10:54\
or on a printed program.\
10:57\
While the sacrament\
meeting should\
10:59\
have an opening\
and closing prayer,\
11:01\
the second meeting need\
only have a closing prayer.\
11:06\
As was mentioned earlier,\
the new Sunday schedule\
11:08\
will not commence\
until January 2019.\
11:12\
There are several\
reasons for this.\
11:14\
The two most\
important are, first,\
11:17\
to have time to\
distribute the Come,\
11:20\
Follow Me resource for\
individuals and families\
11:23\
and, second, to allow time for\
stake presidents and bishops\
11:27\
to arrange meeting schedules\
with the goal of having more\
11:31\
wards meet earlier in the day.\
11:34\
As leaders have\
sought revelation,\
11:37\
the guidance received over the\
past few years is to strengthen\
11:41\
the sacrament meeting,\
honor the Sabbath day,\
11:44\
and encourage and assist\
parents and individuals to make\
11:49\
their homes a source\
of spiritual strength\
11:52\
and increased faith--a\
place of joy and happiness.\
11:57\
What do these adjustments\
mean for members\
11:59\
of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints?\
12:02\
We are confident\
that members will be\
12:05\
blessed in extraordinary ways.\
12:07\
Sunday can be a day of\
gospel learning and teaching\
12:11\
at church and in the home.\
12:13\
As individuals and\
families engage\
12:15\
in family councils, family\
history, ministering, service,\
12:19\
personal worship, and\
joyful family time,\
12:23\
the Sabbath day will\
truly be a delight.\
12:27\
One family from\
Brazil are members\
12:29\
of a stake where the\
new home Come, Follow Me\
12:32\
resource was tested.\
12:34\
The father, Fernando, a returned\
missionary who with his wife,\
12:38\
Nancy, are the parents of\
four young children, reported:\
12:43\
"When the Come, Follow\
Me program was introduced\
12:46\
in our stake, I was so\
excited, and I thought,\
12:49\
'The way that we study the\
scriptures at home is going\
12:52\
to change.'\
12:53\
It really happened in my\
home, and as a Church leader\
12:58\
I saw that it happened\
in other homes.\
13:00\
...\
13:01\
It helped us to really discuss\
the scriptures in our home.\
13:04\
My wife and I had a deeper\
understanding about the topic\
13:08\
studied. ...\
13:09\
It helped us ... amplify\
our gospel knowledge,\
13:12\
and enhance our\
faith and testimony.\
13:14\
...\
13:15\
I bear my testimony ...\
that I know it was inspired\
13:18\
by the Lord so that the\
consistent and effective study\
13:22\
of the principles and doctrines\
contained in the scriptures\
13:26\
brings more faith, testimony,\
and light to the families ...\
13:32\
in an increasingly\
fallen world."\
13:36\
In pilot test stakes\
across the world\
13:38\
there was a highly favorable\
response to the new Come,\
13:42\
Follow Me home resource.\
13:44\
Many reported that\
they progressed\
13:47\
from reading scriptures\
to actually studying\
13:49\
the scriptures.\
13:50\
It was also commonly\
felt the experience\
13:53\
was faith-promoting and had a\
wonderful impact on the ward.\
13:58\
The goal of these\
adjustments is to obtain\
14:00\
a deep and lasting conversion\
of adults and the rising\
14:05\
generation.\
14:06\
The first page of the\
individual and family resource\
14:10\
points out: "The aim of all\
gospel learning and teaching\
14:14\
is to deepen our conversion\
and help us become more\
14:17\
like Jesus Christ.\
14:18\
...\
14:19\
This means relying on Christ\
to change our hearts."\
14:24\
This is assisted by\
reaching "beyond a classroom\
14:28\
into an individual's\
heart and home.\
14:32\
It requires consistent, daily\
efforts to understand and live\
14:36\
the gospel.\
14:37\
True conversion requires the\
influence of the Holy Ghost."\
14:42\
The most important goal\
and ultimate blessing\
14:45\
of deep and lasting\
conversion is worthily\
14:49\
receiving the covenants\
and ordinances\
14:51\
of the covenant pathway.\
14:53\
We trust you to counsel\
together and to seek revelation\
14:58\
for implementing these\
adjustments--while not looking\
15:01\
beyond the mark or trying\
to regiment individuals\
15:05\
or families.\
15:06\
Additional information\
will be shared\
15:08\
in upcoming communications,\
including a First Presidency\
15:13\
letter and enclosure.\
15:15\
I testify to you that\
in the deliberations\
15:20\
of the Council of\
the First Presidency\
15:22\
and the Quorum of the Twelve\
Apostles in the temple,\
15:25\
and after our beloved\
prophet petitioned\
15:28\
the Lord for revelation to move\
forward with these adjustments,\
15:32\
a powerful confirmation\
was received by all.\
15:37\
Russell M. Nelson is our\
living President and prophet.\
15:40\
The announcements\
made today will\
15:42\
result in profound blessings\
for those who enthusiastically\
15:47\
embrace the adjustments and seek\
the guidance of the Holy Ghost.\
15:51\
We will become closer to our\
Heavenly Father and our Lord\
15:55\
and Savior Jesus Christ, of\
whom I am a sure witness.\
15:59\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
