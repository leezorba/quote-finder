Thank you, sisters and elders.\
0:03\
We are with you.\
0:06\
In Old Testament\
history, we read\
0:08\
of successive periods when\
the children of Israel\
0:12\
honored their covenant with\
Jehovah and worshipped Him\
0:15\
and other times when they\
ignored that covenant\
0:19\
and worshipped idols or Baalim.\
0:22\
The reign of Ahab was\
one of the periods\
0:25\
of apostasy in the\
northern kingdom of Israel.\
0:28\
The prophet Elijah\
on one occasion\
0:31\
told King Ahab to gather\
the people of Israel\
0:35\
as well as the prophets\
or priests of Baal\
0:38\
at Mount Carmel.\
0:40\
When the people\
had come together,\
0:43\
Elijah said unto them: "How long\
halt ye between two opinions?\
0:49\
[Or in other words, "When will\
you decide once and for all?"]\
0:53\
if the Lord be God, follow him:\
but if Baal, then follow him.\
1:00\
And the people answered\
him not a word."\
1:04\
So Elijah directed that\
both he and Baal's prophets\
1:09\
cut up a young bull and\
place it on a bed of wood\
1:12\
on their respective altars,\
but "put no fire under."\
1:17\
Then, "Call ye on the\
name of your gods,\
1:22\
and I will call on\
the name of the Lord:\
1:24\
and the God that answereth\
by fire, let him be God.\
1:29\
And all the people answered\
and said, It is well spoken."\
1:35\
You will recall that\
the priests of Baal\
1:37\
clamored to their\
nonexistent god for hours\
1:41\
to send down fire,\
but "there was\
1:43\
neither voice, nor any to\
answer, nor any that regarded."\
1:48\
When it was Elijah's turn, he\
repaired the broken-down altar\
1:52\
of the Lord, laid the wood\
and the offering upon it,\
1:57\
and then ordered that it all\
be doused with water, not once\
2:03\
but three times.\
2:05\
There was no doubt that neither\
he nor any other human power\
2:09\
could light the fire.\
2:11\
"And it came to pass at the time\
of the offering of the evening\
2:14\
sacrifice, that Elijah the\
prophet came near, and said,\
2:18\
Lord God of Abraham,\
Isaac, and of Israel,\
2:22\
let it be known this day\
that thou art God in Israel,\
2:27\
and that I am thy servant,\
and that I have done all these\
2:30\
things at thy word. ...\
2:33\
"Then the fire of the Lord\
fell, and consumed the burnt\
2:36\
sacrifice, and the wood, and\
the stones, and the dust,\
2:40\
and licked up the water\
that was in the trench.\
2:44\
"And when all the people saw\
it, they fell on their faces:\
2:46\
and they said, The Lord,\
he is the God; the Lord,\
2:51\
he is the God."\
2:54\
Today Elijah might say:\
2:57\
Either God, our Heavenly\
Father, exists or He does not,\
3:00\
but if He exists, worship Him.\
3:04\
Either Jesus Christ is the\
Son of God, the resurrected\
3:07\
Redeemer of mankind, or He is\
not, but if He is, follow Him.\
3:14\
Either the Book of Mormon is\
the word of God or it is not,\
3:17\
but if it is, then "get nearer\
to God by [studying and]\
3:22\
abiding by its precepts."\
3:25\
Either Joseph Smith\
saw and conversed\
3:27\
with the Father and the\
Son that spring day of 1820\
3:32\
or he did not, but\
if he did, then\
3:36\
follow the prophetic\
mantle, including\
3:38\
the keys of sealing that I,\
Elijah, bestowed upon him.\
3:44\
In the most recent\
general conference,\
3:46\
President Russell\
M. Nelson declared:\
3:48\
"You don't have to wonder\
about what is true.\
3:51\
You do not have to wonder\
whom you can safely trust.\
3:54\
Through personal revelation,\
you can receive your own witness\
3:58\
that the Book of Mormon\
is the word of God,\
4:00\
that Joseph Smith is a\
prophet, and that this\
4:03\
is the Lord's Church.\
4:05\
Regardless of what\
others may say or do,\
4:07\
no one can ever take away a\
witness borne to your heart\
4:11\
and mind about what is true."\
4:16\
When James promised\
that God "giveth\
4:18\
to all men liberally" who seek\
His wisdom, he also cautioned:\
4:22\
"But let him ask in\
faith, nothing wavering.\
4:25\
For he that wavereth\
is like a wave\
4:27\
of the sea driven with\
the wind and tossed.\
4:30\
"For let not that man\
think that he shall\
4:32\
receive any thing of the Lord.\
4:34\
"A double minded man is\
unstable in all his ways."\
4:40\
Our Savior, on the other\
hand, was the perfect example\
4:43\
of stability.\
4:44\
He said, "The Father\
hath not left me alone;\
4:47\
for I do always those\
things that please him."\
4:52\
Consider these descriptions from\
the scriptures of men and women\
4:56\
who, like the Savior,\
were firm and steadfast:\
5:01\
They "were converted\
unto the true faith;\
5:04\
and they would not\
depart from it,\
5:06\
for they were firm, and\
steadfast, and immovable,\
5:09\
willing with all\
diligence to keep\
5:12\
the commandments of the Lord."\
5:15\
"Their minds are firm, and\
they do put their trust in God\
5:19\
continually."\
5:21\
"And behold, ye\
[yourselves know],\
5:24\
for ye have witnessed it, that\
as many of them as are brought\
5:27\
to the knowledge\
of the truth ...\
5:30\
are firm and steadfast\
in the faith, and ...\
5:33\
the thing wherewith they\
have been made free."\
5:36\
"And they continued steadfastly\
in the apostles' doctrine\
5:40\
and fellowship, and in breaking\
of bread, and in prayers."\
5:45\
To persevere firm and steadfast\
in the faith of Christ\
5:49\
requires that the\
gospel of Jesus Christ\
5:52\
penetrate one's heart and soul,\
meaning that the gospel becomes\
5:57\
not just one of many\
influences in a person's life,\
6:00\
but the defining focus of his\
or her life and character.\
6:06\
The Lord says:\
6:08\
"A new heart also\
will I give you,\
6:09\
and a new spirit will\
I put within you:\
6:12\
and I will take away the\
stony heart out of your flesh,\
6:15\
and I will give you\
an heart of flesh.\
6:18\
"And I will put my\
spirit within you,\
6:20\
and cause you to\
walk in my statutes,\
6:22\
and ye shall keep my\
judgments, and do them.\
6:25\
"And ... ye shall be my people,\
and I will be your God."\
6:30\
This is the covenant\
we make by our baptism\
6:33\
and in temple ordinances.\
6:35\
But some have not\
yet fully received\
6:37\
the gospel of Jesus\
Christ into their lives.\
6:41\
Although, as Paul says, they\
were "buried with [Christ]\
6:45\
by baptism," they are still\
missing the part that "like\
6:49\
as Christ was raised up from\
the dead ..., even so we ...\
6:52\
should walk in [a]\
newness of life."\
6:55\
The gospel does not\
yet define them.\
6:58\
They're not yet\
centered in Christ.\
7:02\
They are selective about the\
doctrines and commandments\
7:05\
they will follow\
and where and when\
7:07\
they will serve in the Church.\
7:09\
By contrast, it is in keeping\
their covenants with exactness\
7:14\
that those "who are the elect\
according to the covenant"\
7:18\
avoid deception and remain\
firm in the faith of Christ.\
7:24\
Most of us find\
ourselves at this moment\
7:26\
on a continuum between\
a socially motivated\
7:31\
participation in gospel\
rituals on the one hand\
7:34\
and a fully\
developed, Christlike\
7:37\
commitment to the will\
of God on the other.\
7:40\
Somewhere along that\
continuum, the good news\
7:44\
of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ enters into our heart\
7:48\
and takes possession\
of our soul.\
7:50\
It may not happen in an\
instant, but we should all\
7:53\
be moving toward\
that blessed state.\
7:57\
It is challenging but vital\
to remain firm and steadfast\
8:03\
when we find ourselves\
being refined\
8:05\
"in the furnace of\
affliction," something\
8:08\
that comes soon or late\
to all of us in mortality.\
8:13\
Without God, these\
dark experiences\
8:16\
tend to despondency,\
despair, and even bitterness.\
8:20\
With God, comfort replaces\
pain, peace replaces turmoil,\
8:26\
and hope replaces sorrow.\
8:29\
Remaining firm in\
the faith of Christ\
8:33\
will bring His sustaining\
grace and support;\
8:36\
He will convert\
trial into blessing\
8:39\
and, in Isaiah's words,\
give "beauty for ashes."\
8:45\
May I mention three\
examples of which\
8:47\
I have personal knowledge:\
8:51\
There is a woman who\
suffers with a debilitating\
8:54\
chronic illness that persists\
despite medical attention,\
8:58\
priesthood blessings,\
and fasting and prayers.\
9:01\
Nevertheless, her faith\
in the power of prayer\
9:05\
and the reality of God's\
love for her is undiminished.\
9:09\
She presses ahead day\
by day--sometimes hour\
9:13\
by hour--serving as called in\
Church and, together with her\
9:18\
husband, looking after\
her young family,\
9:21\
smiling as much as she can.\
9:24\
Her compassion for\
others runs deep,\
9:27\
refined by her own suffering,\
and she often loses herself\
9:32\
in ministering to others.\
9:34\
She continues\
steadfast, and people\
9:37\
feel happy being around her.\
9:40\
A man who grew up in\
the Church, served\
9:43\
as a full-time missionary,\
and married a lovely woman\
9:46\
was surprised when\
some of his siblings\
9:48\
began speaking critically of the\
Church and the Prophet Joseph\
9:52\
Smith.\
9:53\
After a time they\
left the Church\
9:55\
and tried to persuade\
him to follow.\
9:57\
As often happens\
in such cases, they\
10:00\
bombarded him with essays,\
podcasts, and videos\
10:03\
produced by critics,\
most of whom\
10:06\
were themselves disaffected\
former members of the Church.\
10:10\
His siblings mocked his\
faith, telling him he\
10:14\
was gullible and misled.\
10:16\
He didn't have answers\
for all their assertions,\
10:19\
and his faith began\
to waver under\
10:21\
the relentless opposition.\
10:23\
He wondered if he should\
stop attending church.\
10:26\
He talked with his wife.\
10:28\
He talked with\
people he trusted.\
10:30\
He prayed.\
10:31\
As he meditated in this\
troubled state of mind,\
10:34\
he recalled occasions when\
he had felt the Holy Spirit\
10:39\
and had received a witness\
of the truth by the Spirit.\
10:42\
He concluded, "If I\
am honest with myself,\
10:47\
I must admit that the Spirit\
has touched me more than once\
10:51\
and the testimony of\
the Spirit is real."\
10:55\
He has a renewed sense\
of happiness and peace\
10:58\
that is shared by his\
wife and children.\
11:02\
A husband and wife who have\
consistently and happily\
11:05\
followed the counsel of\
the Brethren in their lives\
11:08\
were grieved by\
the difficulty they\
11:10\
experienced in having children.\
11:13\
They expended\
substantial funds working\
11:16\
with competent\
medical professionals,\
11:19\
and after a time, they\
were blessed with a son.\
11:23\
Tragically, however,\
after only about a year,\
11:27\
the baby was the\
victim of an accident\
11:29\
that was no one's fault but\
that left him semicomatose\
11:33\
with significant brain damage.\
11:36\
He has received\
the best of care,\
11:38\
but doctors cannot predict\
how things will unfold going\
11:42\
forward.\
11:43\
The child this couple\
worked and prayed\
11:46\
so hard to bring into the world\
has in a sense been taken away,\
11:52\
and they don't know if he\
will be returned to them.\
11:55\
They struggle now to care for\
their baby's critical needs\
11:59\
while meeting their\
other responsibilities.\
12:02\
In this supremely\
difficult moment\
12:05\
they have turned to the Lord.\
12:07\
They rely on the "daily\
bread" they receive from Him.\
12:10\
They are aided by compassionate\
friends and family\
12:13\
and strengthened by\
priesthood blessings.\
12:16\
They have drawn\
closer to one another,\
12:19\
their union perhaps now\
deeper and more complete\
12:22\
than might otherwise\
have been possible.\
12:26\
On July 23, 1837, the\
Lord directed a revelation\
12:30\
to the then-President of\
the Quorum of the Twelve\
12:33\
Apostles, Thomas B. Marsh.\
12:34\
It included the following:\
12:37\
"And pray for thy\
brethren of the Twelve.\
12:39\
Admonish them sharply\
for my name's sake,\
12:42\
and let them be admonished\
for all their sins,\
12:45\
and be ye faithful\
before me unto my name.\
12:50\
"And after their temptations,\
and much tribulation, behold,\
12:54\
I, the Lord, will\
feel after them,\
12:56\
and if they harden\
not their hearts,\
12:58\
and stiffen not their\
necks against me,\
13:00\
they shall be converted,\
and I will heal them."\
13:04\
I believe the principles\
expressed in these verses apply\
13:06\
to all of us.\
13:08\
The temptations and\
tribulations we experience,\
13:11\
plus any testing that the\
Lord sees fit to impose,\
13:14\
can lead to our full\
conversion and healing.\
13:17\
But this happens if, and only\
if, we do not harden our hearts\
13:23\
or stiffen our\
necks against Him.\
13:25\
If we remain firm and\
steadfast, come what may,\
13:29\
we achieve the conversion the\
Savior intended when He said\
13:34\
to Peter, "When\
thou art converted,\
13:36\
strengthen thy brethren," a\
conversion so complete that it\
13:41\
cannot be undone.\
13:43\
The promised healing is the\
cleansing and sanctification\
13:47\
of our sin-wounded\
souls, making us holy.\
13:54\
I am reminded of our mothers'\
counsel: "Eat your vegetables;\
13:59\
it will do you good."\
14:00\
Our mothers are right, and in\
the context of steadfastness\
14:06\
in the faith, "eating\
your vegetables"\
14:08\
is to pray constantly, to\
feast on the scriptures\
14:12\
daily, serve and\
worship in the Church,\
14:15\
worthily take the sacrament\
each week, love your neighbor,\
14:19\
and take up your cross in\
obedience to God each day.\
14:24\
Always remember the\
promise of good things\
14:26\
to come, both now and\
hereafter, for those\
14:31\
who are firm and steadfast\
in the faith of Christ.\
14:35\
Remember "eternal life,\
and the joy of the saints."\
14:40\
"O all ye that are pure in\
heart, lift up your heads\
14:44\
and receive the pleasing word\
of God, and feast upon his love;\
14:49\
for ye may, if your\
minds are firm, forever."\
14:55\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen\
}
