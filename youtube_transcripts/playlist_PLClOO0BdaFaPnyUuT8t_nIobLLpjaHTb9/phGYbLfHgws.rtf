Several years ago, while\
preparing for a business trip,\
0:04\
I began to experience\
chest pain.\
0:07\
Out of concern, my wife\
decided to accompany me.\
0:11\
On the first leg of\
our flight, the pain\
0:14\
intensified to the point\
that it was difficult for me\
0:17\
to breathe.\
0:18\
When we landed, we\
left the airport\
0:21\
and went to the local hospital,\
where after multiple tests\
0:25\
the attending physician declared\
us safe to continue our travel.\
0:31\
We returned to the airport\
and boarded a flight\
0:33\
to our final destination.\
0:36\
As we were descending, the\
pilot came on the intercom\
0:40\
and asked me to identify myself.\
0:43\
The flight attendant\
approached, said\
0:46\
they had just received\
an emergency call,\
0:50\
and told me there was\
an ambulance waiting\
0:52\
at the airport to take\
me to the hospital.\
0:56\
We boarded the ambulance\
and were rushed\
0:58\
to the local emergency room.\
1:00\
There we were met by\
two anxious doctors who\
1:06\
explained that I had\
been misdiagnosed\
1:10\
and actually had a serious\
pulmonary embolism,\
1:13\
or blood clot in my\
lung, which required\
1:16\
immediate medical attention.\
1:19\
The doctors informed us\
that many patients do not\
1:23\
survive this condition.\
1:25\
Knowing we were far\
from home and not\
1:28\
sure if we were prepared for\
such life-altering events,\
1:33\
the doctors said that if there\
was anything in our lives\
1:37\
that we needed to\
consider, now was the time.\
1:41\
I remember well how\
almost instantaneously,\
1:45\
in that anxious moment, my\
entire perspective changed.\
1:50\
What seemed so important\
just moments earlier\
1:54\
was now of little interest.\
1:56\
My mind raced away from the\
comfort and cares of this life\
2:00\
to an eternal\
perspective--thoughts\
2:03\
of family, children, my wife,\
and ultimately an assessment\
2:11\
of my own life.\
2:14\
How were we doing as a\
family and individually?\
2:17\
Were we living our lives\
consistent with the covenants\
2:21\
we had made and the\
Lord's expectations,\
2:24\
or had we perhaps\
unintentionally allowed\
2:29\
the cares of the\
world to distract us\
2:31\
from those things\
which matter most?\
2:35\
I would invite you to consider\
an important lesson learned\
2:38\
from this experience: to\
step back from the world\
2:43\
and to assess your life.\
2:46\
Or in the words of\
the doctor, if there\
2:50\
is anything in your life\
you need to consider,\
2:54\
now is the time.\
2:57\
We live in a world of\
information overload,\
2:59\
dominated by ever-increasing\
distractions that\
3:03\
make it more and more\
difficult to sort\
3:05\
through the commotion\
of this life\
3:08\
and focus on things\
of eternal worth.\
3:11\
Our daily lives\
are bombarded with\
3:14\
attention-grabbing\
headlines served up\
3:16\
by rapidly changing\
technologies.\
3:20\
Unless we take the\
time to reflect,\
3:23\
we may not realize the impact\
of this fast-paced environment\
3:28\
on our daily lives and\
the choices we make.\
3:32\
We may find our lives\
consumed with bursts\
3:36\
of information packaged in\
memes, videos, and glaring\
3:41\
headlines.\
3:42\
Although interesting and\
entertaining, most of these\
3:47\
have little to do with\
our eternal progress,\
3:50\
and yet they shape the way we\
view our mortal experience.\
3:57\
These worldly distractions\
could be likened\
3:59\
to those in Lehi's dream.\
4:02\
As we progress down the covenant\
path with our hand firmly\
4:06\
affixed on the iron\
rod, we hear and see\
4:10\
those "mocking and\
pointing their fingers"\
4:13\
from the great and\
spacious building.\
4:16\
We may not consciously\
intend to do so,\
4:20\
but sometimes we pause\
and shift our gaze\
4:24\
to see what all\
the commotion is.\
4:27\
Some of us may even\
let go of the iron rod\
4:31\
and move closer\
for a better view.\
4:34\
Others may fall away\
entirely "because of those\
4:40\
that were scoffing at them."\
4:42\
The Savior cautioned\
us to "take heed ...\
4:46\
lest at any time your hearts\
be overcharged with ...\
4:50\
cares of this life."\
4:52\
Modern revelation reminds\
us that many are called,\
4:57\
but few are chosen.\
4:58\
They are not chosen "because\
their hearts are set ...\
5:02\
upon the things of this world,\
and aspire to the honors\
5:06\
of men."\
5:07\
Assessing our lives\
gives us an opportunity\
5:10\
to step back from\
the world, reflect on\
5:14\
where we stand on the covenant\
path, and, if necessary,\
5:18\
make adjustments to ensure a\
firm grip and a forward gaze.\
5:26\
Recently, in a worldwide\
youth devotional,\
5:28\
President Russell M.\
Nelson invited the youth\
5:31\
to step back from the world,\
disengaging from social media\
5:36\
by holding a seven-day fast,\
and just last evening also\
5:40\
invited the sisters as part\
of the women's conference.\
5:43\
He then asked them--asked\
the youth--to notice any\
5:47\
differences in how they\
feel, what they think,\
5:52\
or even how they think.\
5:55\
He then invited them "to do a\
thorough life assessment with\
5:59\
the Lord ... to ensure that\
your feet are firmly planted\
6:03\
on the covenant path."\
6:05\
He encouraged them that if\
there were things in their lives\
6:09\
that needed changing, "today\
is the perfect time to change."\
6:16\
In assessing things in our\
lives that need to change,\
6:19\
we might ask ourselves\
a practical question:\
6:23\
How do we rise above the\
distractions of this world\
6:27\
and stay fixed on the vision\
of eternity before us?\
6:33\
In a 2007 conference address\
entitled "Good, Better, Best,"\
6:38\
President Dallin\
H. Oaks taught how\
6:40\
to prioritize choices among\
our many conflicting worldly\
6:44\
demands.\
6:45\
He counseled, "We have to\
forego some good things in order\
6:51\
to choose others that are better\
or best because they develop\
6:56\
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ\
and strengthen our families."\
7:03\
May I suggest that the\
best things in this life\
7:07\
are centered on Jesus\
Christ and understanding\
7:11\
the eternal truths of\
who He is and who we are\
7:15\
in our relationship with Him.\
7:19\
As we seek to know\
the Savior, we\
7:22\
should not overlook the\
fundamental truth of who we are\
7:25\
and why we are here.\
7:27\
Amulek reminds us that\
"this life is the time ...\
7:31\
to prepare to meet God,"\
the time "which is given us\
7:35\
to prepare for eternity."\
7:38\
As the well-known\
axiom reminds us,\
7:41\
"We are not human beings\
having a spiritual experience.\
7:46\
We are spiritual beings\
having a human experience."\
7:52\
Understanding our\
divine origins is\
7:54\
essential to our\
eternal progress\
7:57\
and can free us from the\
distractions of this life.\
8:00\
The Savior taught:\
8:03\
"If ye continue in my word, then\
[ye are] my disciples indeed;\
8:07\
"And ye shall know the\
truth, and the truth\
8:11\
[will] make you free."\
8:13\
President Joseph F. Smith\
proclaimed, "The greatest\
8:18\
achievement mankind can\
make in this world is\
8:21\
to familiarize themselves\
with divine truth,\
8:25\
so thoroughly, so\
perfectly, that the example\
8:29\
or conduct of no creature\
living in the world\
8:33\
can ever turn them\
away from the knowledge\
8:36\
that they have obtained."\
8:38\
In the world today,\
the debate over truth\
8:43\
has reached a fevered pitch,\
with all sides claiming truth\
8:47\
as if it were a\
relative concept open\
8:50\
to individual interpretation.\
8:53\
The young boy Joseph Smith\
found that "so great were\
8:56\
the confusion and strife" in\
his life that "it was impossible\
9:01\
... to come to any certain\
conclusion who was right\
9:05\
and who was wrong."\
9:07\
It was "in the midst of\
this war of words and tumult\
9:10\
of opinions" that he\
sought divine guidance\
9:15\
by seeking truth.\
9:18\
In April conference,\
President Nelson\
9:20\
taught, "If we are to have\
any hope of sifting through\
9:24\
the myriad of voices and\
the philosophies of men\
9:28\
that attack truth, we must\
learn to receive revelation."\
9:35\
We must learn to rely\
on the Spirit of Truth,\
9:38\
which "the world cannot receive,\
because it seeth him not,\
9:43\
neither knoweth him."\
9:46\
As this world moves swiftly\
to alternative realities,\
9:50\
we must remember\
the words of Jacob\
9:52\
that "the Spirit speaketh\
the truth and lieth not.\
9:57\
Wherefore, it speaketh\
of things as they really\
10:01\
are, and of things as\
they really will be;\
10:05\
wherefore, these things are\
manifested unto us plainly,\
10:10\
for the salvation of our souls."\
10:13\
As we step back from the\
world and assess our lives,\
10:17\
now is the time to consider\
what changes we need to make.\
10:21\
We can take great\
hope in knowing\
10:25\
that our exemplar, Jesus Christ,\
has once again led the way.\
10:29\
Prior to His death\
and Resurrection,\
10:33\
as He was laboring to\
help those around Him\
10:35\
understand His divine role, He\
reminded them "that in me ye\
10:41\
might have peace.\
10:43\
In the world ye shall\
have tribulation:\
10:46\
but be of good cheer; I\
have overcome the world."\
10:51\
Of Him I bear witness in the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
