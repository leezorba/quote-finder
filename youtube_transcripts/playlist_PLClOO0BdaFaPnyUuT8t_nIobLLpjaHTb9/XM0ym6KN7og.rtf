As parents in Zion, we have\
a sacred responsibility,\
0:06\
a duty to awaken within our\
children passion and commitment\
0:10\
to the gospel of Jesus\
Christ--to the light\
0:14\
and the truths of that gospel.\
0:16\
While raising our children,\
we establish traditions\
0:19\
within our home, and\
we build patterns\
0:22\
of communication and\
behavior within our family\
0:25\
relationships.\
0:26\
In doing so, the\
traditions we establish\
0:30\
should ingrain strong,\
unwavering characteristics\
0:34\
of goodness in our children\
that will infuse them\
0:38\
with strength to confront\
the challenges of life.\
0:42\
For many years, our family has\
enjoyed the annual tradition\
0:45\
of camping high in the Uintah\
Mountains of northeastern Utah.\
0:49\
We travel 20 miles\
over a rocky dirt road\
0:53\
to arrive at a beautiful green\
valley with towering canyon\
0:56\
walls and through which\
runs a river filled\
1:00\
with cold, clear water.\
1:02\
Each year, hoping to reaffirm\
the value of gospel doctrine\
1:06\
and practices within the\
hearts of our children\
1:10\
and our grandchildren,\
Susan and I\
1:13\
ask each of our six\
sons and their families\
1:15\
to prepare a short\
message on a topic they\
1:20\
feel is an important\
element in the foundation\
1:23\
of a Christ-centered home.\
1:25\
We then gather for a family\
devotional in a secluded place,\
1:31\
and each presents their message.\
1:33\
This year our grandchildren\
wrote the topic\
1:37\
of their message on stones\
and then, one by one,\
1:43\
buried them next to one another,\
representing a sure foundation\
1:47\
upon which a happy\
life is established.\
1:50\
Woven among all six\
of their messages\
1:53\
was the immutable, eternal\
truth that Jesus Christ\
1:57\
is the cornerstone\
of that foundation.\
2:01\
In the words of\
Isaiah, "Therefore thus\
2:04\
saith the Lord God, Behold, I\
lay in Zion for a foundation\
2:09\
a stone, a tried stone,\
a precious corner stone,\
2:14\
a sure foundation."\
2:17\
Jesus Christ is that\
precious cornerstone\
2:20\
in the foundation of Zion.\
2:21\
It was He who revealed to\
the Prophet Joseph Smith:\
2:25\
"Wherefore, be not\
weary in well-doing,\
2:27\
for ye are laying the\
foundation of a great work.\
2:30\
And out of small\
things proceedeth\
2:33\
that which is great."\
2:35\
Lessons taught through the\
traditions we establish\
2:38\
in our homes, though\
small and simple,\
2:40\
are increasingly important\
in today's world.\
2:44\
What are the small and simple\
things that, when established,\
2:48\
will perform a great work in\
the lives of our children?\
2:53\
President Russell\
M. Nelson recently\
2:55\
addressed a large congregation\
in Toronto, Canada,\
2:58\
and poignantly reminded parents\
of the sacred responsibility\
3:02\
we have to teach our children.\
3:04\
Among the essential\
responsibilities identified,\
3:08\
President Nelson\
emphasized the duties\
3:12\
we have as parents to teach\
our children to understand why\
3:16\
we partake of the sacrament,\
the significance of being born\
3:20\
in the covenant, the\
importance of preparing for\
3:24\
and receiving a\
patriarchal blessing,\
3:26\
and he encouraged\
parents to lead out\
3:30\
in the reading of scriptures\
together as a family.\
3:33\
By these efforts,\
our beloved prophet\
3:38\
urges us to make our homes\
"sanctuaries of faith."\
3:45\
In the Book of Mormon,\
Enos records the gratitude\
3:48\
he felt for the example\
of his father, who\
3:51\
"taught [him] in his language,\
and also in the nurture\
3:56\
and admonition of the Lord."\
3:59\
With great emotion,\
Enos exclaimed,\
4:02\
"And blessed be the\
name of my God for it."\
4:06\
I cherish the small\
and simple traditions\
4:09\
we have come to observe\
in our home over the 35\
4:12\
years of our marriage.\
4:13\
Many of our traditions\
are subtle yet meaningful.\
4:17\
For example:\
4:18\
During evenings when\
I was away from home,\
4:21\
I always knew that our oldest\
son present would take it\
4:25\
upon himself,\
without being asked,\
4:27\
to lead the family in scripture\
study and family prayer.\
4:32\
Another tradition--we\
never leave our home or end\
4:36\
a telephone conversation\
without saying, "I love you."\
4:43\
Our lives have been\
blessed by setting aside\
4:45\
time on a regular basis to enjoy\
personal interviews with each\
4:50\
of our sons.\
4:52\
During one interview\
I asked our son\
4:54\
about his desires and\
preparation to serve a mission.\
4:57\
After some discussion, there was\
a moment of reflective silence;\
5:02\
then he leaned forward\
and thoughtfully declared,\
5:06\
"Dad, remember when I\
was little and we started\
5:10\
having father's interviews?"\
5:12\
I said, "Yes."\
5:14\
"Well," he said, "I\
promised you then\
5:17\
that I would serve a\
mission, and you and Mom\
5:20\
promised me that you and Mom\
would serve a mission when\
5:23\
you got old."\
5:24\
Then there was another pause.\
5:27\
"Are you guys having some\
problem that will stop you from\
5:30\
serving ... because\
maybe I can help?"\
5:33\
[LAUGHTER]\
5:35\
Consistent, wholesome\
family traditions\
5:39\
that include prayer, scripture\
reading, family home evening,\
5:43\
and attendance at\
Church meetings,\
5:45\
though seemingly\
small and simple,\
5:48\
create a culture of love,\
respect, unity, and security.\
5:54\
In the spirit that\
accompanies these efforts,\
5:56\
our children become protected\
from the fiery darts\
6:00\
of the adversary so embedded in\
the worldly culture of our day.\
6:06\
We are reminded of the wise\
counsel of Helaman to his sons:\
6:10\
"Remember that it is upon\
the rock of our Redeemer,\
6:14\
who is Christ, the Son of\
God, that ye must build\
6:19\
your foundation; that when\
the devil shall send forth his\
6:23\
mighty winds, yea, his\
shafts in the whirlwind, yea,\
6:27\
when all his hail and his mighty\
storm shall beat upon you,\
6:31\
it shall have no power over you\
to drag you down to the gulf\
6:37\
of misery and endless wo,\
because of the rock upon which\
6:42\
ye are built, which\
is a sure foundation,\
6:45\
a foundation whereon if men\
build they cannot fall."\
6:50\
Years ago, while serving\
as a young bishop,\
6:53\
an older gentleman\
asked to meet with me.\
6:57\
He described his\
departure from the Church\
6:59\
and the righteous\
traditions of his parents\
7:02\
when he was in his youth.\
7:04\
He described in\
detail the heartache\
7:06\
he experienced during his\
life while vainly seeking\
7:10\
lasting joy amidst the momentary\
happiness the world has\
7:15\
to offer.\
7:16\
Now, in his later\
years of life, he\
7:19\
experienced the tender,\
sometimes nagging,\
7:23\
whispering sensations of the\
Spirit of God guiding him\
7:27\
back to the lessons,\
practices, and the feelings\
7:30\
and spiritual\
safety of his youth.\
7:34\
He expressed gratitude for\
the traditions of his parents,\
7:39\
and in modern-day\
words, he echoed\
7:41\
the proclamation of Enos:\
"Blessed be the name of my God\
7:45\
for it."\
7:47\
In my experience, this dear\
man's return to the gospel\
7:52\
is characteristic of many\
and is repeated often\
7:56\
among God's children\
who leave for a time,\
7:59\
only to return to the\
teachings and the practices\
8:03\
of their youth.\
8:04\
In these moments, we\
witness the wisdom\
8:07\
of the writer of the\
proverb, who exhorts parents,\
8:11\
"Train up a child in the way he\
should go: and when he is old,\
8:16\
he will not depart from it."\
8:19\
Every parent faces moments\
of frustration and varying\
8:22\
levels of determination\
and strength\
8:25\
while raising children.\
8:26\
However, when parents\
exercise faith\
8:30\
by teaching children\
candidly, lovingly, and doing\
8:35\
all they can to help\
them along the way,\
8:37\
they receive greater hope\
that the seeds being sown\
8:41\
will take root within the hearts\
and minds of their children.\
8:46\
Moses well understood\
the fundamental need\
8:48\
for constant teaching.\
8:50\
He counseled, "And thou\
shalt teach [these words]\
8:54\
diligently unto thy children,\
and shalt talk [to] them\
8:57\
when thou sittest\
in thine house,\
8:59\
and when thou walkest by the\
way, and when thou liest down,\
9:04\
and when thou risest up."\
9:07\
We kneel beside our children\
during family prayer;\
9:10\
we care for them\
through our efforts\
9:12\
to hold meaningful\
family scripture reading;\
9:15\
we patiently,\
lovingly care for them\
9:18\
as together we participate\
in family home evening;\
9:21\
and we anguish for\
them on our knees\
9:24\
in the midst of our\
private prayers to heaven.\
9:27\
Oh, how we yearn\
for the seeds we\
9:31\
are sowing to take\
root within the hearts\
9:34\
and minds of our children.\
9:37\
I believe that it\
is less a question\
9:39\
of whether our children\
are "getting it"\
9:41\
in the midst of our teaching,\
such as while striving\
9:44\
to read the\
scriptures or to have\
9:46\
family home evening or attend\
Mutual and other Church\
9:50\
meetings.\
9:51\
It is less a question of\
whether in those moments\
9:54\
they are understanding the\
importance of those activities\
9:58\
and more a question of whether\
we, as parents, are exercising\
10:02\
faith enough to follow\
the Lord's counsel\
10:06\
to diligently live, teach,\
exhort, and set forth\
10:11\
expectations that are inspired\
by the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
10:16\
It is an effort driven by our\
faith--our belief that one day,\
10:23\
the seeds sown in their youth\
will take root and begin\
10:27\
to sprout and grow.\
10:29\
The things we talk of, the\
things we preach and teach,\
10:34\
determine the things that\
will happen among us.\
10:37\
As we establish\
wholesome traditions that\
10:39\
teach the doctrine of\
Christ, the Holy Spirit\
10:43\
bears witness of the\
truthfulness of our message\
10:46\
and nourishes the seeds of the\
gospel that are planted deep\
10:50\
in the hearts of our children by\
our efforts all along the way.\
10:54\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
