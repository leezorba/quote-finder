On this historic night,\
I express my love\
0:05\
and appreciation to each\
of you, my dear sisters.\
0:09\
Whatever our age,\
location, or circumstance,\
0:13\
we gather tonight in unity,\
in strength, in purpose,\
0:19\
and in testimony that we are\
loved and led by our Heavenly\
0:24\
Father; our Savior,\
Jesus Christ;\
0:28\
and our living prophet,\
President Russell M. Nelson.\
0:33\
As a young couple,\
my husband and I\
0:35\
were called by our bishop\
to visit and minister\
0:39\
to a family who hadn't been\
to church in many years.\
0:42\
We willingly accepted\
the assignment\
0:45\
and went to their\
home a few days later.\
0:48\
It was immediately clear\
to us that they did not\
0:51\
want visitors from the Church.\
0:54\
So on our next visit\
we approached them\
0:57\
with a plate of cookies,\
confident that chocolate chips\
1:00\
would melt their hearts.\
1:02\
They didn't.\
1:04\
The couple spoke to us\
through the screen door,\
1:06\
making it even clearer\
that we weren't welcome.\
1:10\
But as we drove\
home, we were fairly\
1:12\
certain success might\
have been achieved\
1:14\
had we only offered them\
Rice Krispie treats instead.\
1:17\
[LAUGHTER]\
1:20\
Our lack of spiritual vision\
made additional failed attempts\
1:25\
frustrating.\
1:26\
Rejection is never comfortable.\
1:29\
Over time we began\
to ask ourselves,\
1:32\
"Why are we doing this?\
1:34\
What is our purpose?"\
1:37\
Elder Carl B. Cook\
made this observation:\
1:40\
"Serving in the Church ... can\
be challenging if we are asked\
1:45\
to do something\
that frightens us,\
1:47\
if we grow weary of serving,\
or if we are called to do\
1:51\
something that we do not\
initially find appealing."\
1:57\
We were experiencing the\
truth of Elder Cook's words\
2:00\
when we decided we\
had to seek direction\
2:03\
from Someone with a greater\
perspective than our own.\
2:08\
So after much sincere\
prayer and study,\
2:11\
we received the answer to\
the why of our service.\
2:15\
We had a change\
of understanding,\
2:18\
a change of heart, actually\
a revelatory experience.\
2:23\
As we sought direction\
from the scriptures,\
2:26\
the Lord taught us how to make\
the process of serving others\
2:29\
easier and more meaningful.\
2:32\
Here is the verse we read\
that changed both our hearts\
2:35\
and our approach: "Thou\
shalt love the Lord thy God\
2:40\
with all thy heart, with all\
thy might, mind, and strength;\
2:44\
and in the name of Jesus\
Christ thou shalt serve him."\
2:50\
Though this verse\
was so familiar,\
2:53\
it seemed to speak to us\
in a new and important way.\
2:58\
We realized that\
we were sincerely\
3:00\
striving to serve\
this family and we\
3:03\
wanted to serve\
our bishop, but we\
3:06\
had to ask ourselves if\
we were really serving out\
3:09\
of love for the Lord.\
3:11\
King Benjamin made\
clear this distinction\
3:14\
when he stated,\
"Behold, I say unto you\
3:18\
that because I said unto\
you that I had spent\
3:20\
my days in your service,\
I do not desire to boast,\
3:25\
for I have only been\
in the service of God."\
3:29\
So whom was King\
Benjamin really serving?\
3:33\
Heavenly Father and the Savior.\
3:36\
Knowing the who and the\
why in serving others\
3:40\
helps us understand that the\
highest manifestation of love\
3:44\
is devotion to God.\
3:48\
As our focus gradually\
changed, so did our prayers.\
3:52\
We began looking\
forward to our visits\
3:54\
with this dear family because\
of our love for the Lord.\
3:58\
We were doing it for Him.\
4:01\
He made the struggle\
no longer a struggle.\
4:04\
After many months of our\
standing on the doorstep,\
4:08\
the family began letting us in.\
4:10\
Eventually, we had regular\
prayer and sweet gospel\
4:14\
discussions together.\
4:16\
A long-lasting\
friendship developed.\
4:19\
We were worshipping and loving\
Him by loving His children.\
4:26\
Can you think back on a\
time when you lovingly\
4:29\
reached out with sincere\
effort to help someone in need\
4:33\
and felt that your\
efforts went unnoticed\
4:36\
or perhaps were unappreciated\
or even unwanted?\
4:41\
In that moment, did you question\
the value of your service?\
4:45\
If so, may the words\
of King Benjamin\
4:49\
replace your doubt\
and even your hurt:\
4:52\
"Ye are only in the\
service of your God."\
4:57\
Rather than building\
resentment, we\
4:59\
can build, through service,\
a more perfect relationship\
5:03\
with our Heavenly Father.\
5:05\
Our love for and\
devotion to Him preempts\
5:09\
the need for recognition\
or appreciation\
5:12\
and allows His love to\
flow to and through us.\
5:18\
Sometimes we may initially\
serve from a sense of duty\
5:21\
or obligation, but even that\
service can lead us to draw\
5:27\
on something higher within us,\
leading us to serve in "a more\
5:31\
excellent way"--as in\
President Nelson's invitation\
5:35\
to "a newer, holier approach\
to caring for and ministering\
5:41\
to others."\
5:43\
When we focus on all\
that God has done for us,\
5:46\
our service flows from\
a heart of gratitude.\
5:50\
As we become less concerned\
about our service magnifying\
5:54\
us, we realize instead that\
the focus of our service\
5:59\
will be on putting God first.\
6:03\
President M. Russell\
Ballard taught, "It is only\
6:07\
when we love God and Christ\
with all of our hearts, souls,\
6:11\
and minds that we\
are able to share\
6:13\
this love with our\
neighbors through acts\
6:16\
of kindness and service."\
6:20\
The first of the Ten\
Commandments reiterates this\
6:22\
divine wisdom: "I am\
the Lord thy God. ...\
6:26\
Thou shalt have no\
other gods before me."\
6:29\
The placement of this\
commandment helps us understand\
6:33\
that if we place Him\
as our main priority,\
6:37\
everything else will ultimately\
fall into place--even\
6:42\
our service to others.\
6:44\
When He takes the preeminent\
position in our lives\
6:48\
by our deliberate\
choice, then He\
6:51\
is able to bless our\
actions to our good\
6:54\
and to the good of others.\
6:58\
The Lord counseled, "Look\
unto me in every thought."\
7:01\
And each week we covenant to do\
just that--to "always remember\
7:07\
Him."\
7:08\
Can such a godly focus\
apply in everything we do?\
7:13\
Can performing\
even a menial task\
7:16\
become an opportunity\
to demonstrate our love\
7:19\
and devotion to Him?\
7:21\
I believe it can,\
sisters, and will.\
7:26\
We can make each item on\
our to-do list become a way\
7:29\
to glorify Him.\
7:31\
We can see each task as a\
privilege and opportunity\
7:36\
to serve Him, even when we\
are in the midst of deadlines,\
7:41\
duties, or dirty diapers.\
7:45\
As Ammon said, "Yea, I know that\
I am nothing; as to my strength\
7:50\
I am weak; therefore I\
will not boast of myself,\
7:53\
but I will boast of my\
God, for in his strength\
7:58\
I can do all things."\
8:02\
When serving our God becomes\
our main priority in life,\
8:05\
we lose ourselves, and in due\
course, we find ourselves.\
8:11\
The Savior taught this principle\
so simply and directly:\
8:15\
"Therefore, let your light\
so shine before this people,\
8:18\
that they may see\
your good works\
8:20\
and glorify your Father\
who is in heaven."\
8:26\
May I share with you\
some words of wisdom\
8:28\
that were found on the wall\
of an orphanage in Calcutta,\
8:31\
India: "If you are kind,\
people may accuse you\
8:35\
of selfish, ulterior motives.\
8:38\
Be kind anyway.\
8:40\
What you spend years\
building, someone\
8:44\
could destroy overnight.\
8:45\
Build anyway.\
8:47\
The good you do today, people\
will often forget tomorrow.\
8:52\
Do good anyway.\
8:54\
Give the world\
the best you have,\
8:57\
and it may never be enough.\
9:00\
Give the world the\
best you've got anyway.\
9:04\
You see, in the final analysis,\
it is between you and your God\
9:09\
... anyway."\
9:12\
Sisters, it is always\
between us and the Lord.\
9:16\
As President James\
E. Faust said:\
9:19\
"'What is the greatest\
need in the world?'\
9:21\
...\
9:22\
'Is not the greatest need in all\
of the world for every person\
9:26\
to have a personal,\
ongoing, daily,\
9:29\
continuing relationship\
with the Savior?'\
9:33\
Having such a relationship can\
unchain the divinity within us,\
9:38\
and nothing can make a greater\
difference in our lives\
9:42\
as we come to know\
and understand\
9:45\
our divine\
relationship with God."\
9:50\
Similarly, Alma\
explained to his son,\
9:54\
"Yea, let all thy\
doings be unto the Lord,\
9:58\
and whithersoever thou goest\
let it be in the Lord; yea,\
10:03\
let all thy thoughts be\
directed unto the Lord; yea,\
10:09\
let the affections of thy\
heart be placed upon the Lord\
10:13\
forever."\
10:15\
And President Russell M.\
Nelson has likewise taught us,\
10:19\
"When we comprehend His\
voluntary Atonement,\
10:24\
any sense of\
sacrifice on our part\
10:27\
becomes completely overshadowed\
by a profound sense\
10:31\
of gratitude for the\
privilege of serving Him."\
10:37\
Sisters, I testify that when\
Jesus Christ, through the power\
10:43\
of His Atonement,\
works on us and in us,\
10:48\
He begins to work through\
us to bless others.\
10:52\
We serve them, but we do so\
by loving and serving Him.\
10:58\
We become what the\
scripture describes:\
11:01\
"Every man [and woman] seeking\
the interest of his neighbor,\
11:06\
and doing all things with an\
eye single to the glory of God."\
11:13\
Maybe our bishop knew that\
was the lesson my husband\
11:16\
and I would learn from those\
early and well-intentioned,\
11:20\
yet not perfect,\
efforts to minister\
11:24\
to His beloved\
sons and daughters.\
11:26\
I bear my personal and sure\
witness of the goodness\
11:30\
and love He shares with us even\
as we strive to serve for Him.\
11:38\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
