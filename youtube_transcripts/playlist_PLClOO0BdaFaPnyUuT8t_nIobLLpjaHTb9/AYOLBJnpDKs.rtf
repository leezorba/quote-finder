This has been an inspirational\
and historic conference.\
0:06\
We look to the future\
with enthusiasm.\
0:09\
We have been motivated to\
do better and to be better.\
0:14\
The marvelous messages\
delivered from this pulpit\
0:17\
by our General Authorities\
and General Officers\
0:20\
and the music have been sublime!\
0:24\
I urge you to study these\
messages, commencing this week.\
0:30\
They express the mind and the\
will of the Lord for His people\
0:34\
today.\
0:37\
The new home-centered,\
Church-supported\
0:40\
integrated curriculum\
has the potential\
0:42\
to unleash the power of\
families as each family follows\
0:47\
through conscientiously\
and carefully\
0:50\
to transform their home\
into a sanctuary of faith.\
0:55\
I promise that as\
you diligently work\
0:58\
to remodel your home into a\
center of gospel learning,\
1:03\
over time your Sabbath days\
will truly be a delight.\
1:09\
Your children will be excited to\
learn and to live the Savior's\
1:15\
teachings, and the influence\
of the adversary in your life\
1:19\
and in your home will decrease.\
1:24\
Changes in your family will\
be dramatic and sustaining.\
1:30\
During this conference we\
have strengthened our resolve\
1:33\
to execute the essential\
effort to honor the Lord Jesus\
1:36\
Christ every time we\
refer to His Church.\
1:41\
I promise you that\
our rigorous attention\
1:44\
to use the correct name\
of the Savior's Church\
1:47\
and its members will lead to\
increased faith and access\
1:52\
to greater spiritual power\
for members of His Church.\
1:59\
Now let's turn to\
the topic of temples.\
2:03\
We know that our\
time in the temple\
2:06\
is crucial to our\
salvation and exaltation\
2:10\
and to that of our families.\
2:14\
After we receive our\
own temple ordinances\
2:17\
and make sacred covenants\
with God, each one of us\
2:20\
needs the ongoing spiritual\
strengthening and tutoring\
2:25\
that is only possible in\
the house of the Lord.\
2:28\
And our ancestors need us\
to serve as proxy for them.\
2:34\
Consider the great\
mercy and fairness\
2:37\
of God, who, before the\
foundation of the world,\
2:40\
provided a way to give\
temple blessings to those\
2:43\
who died without a\
knowledge of the gospel.\
2:46\
These sacred temple\
rites are ancient.\
2:50\
To me that antiquity is\
thrilling and another evidence\
2:56\
of their authenticity.\
3:00\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
the assaults of the adversary\
3:03\
are increasing exponentially\
in intensity and in variety.\
3:09\
Our need to be in the\
temple on a regular basis\
3:13\
has never been greater.\
3:15\
I plead with you to\
take a prayerful look\
3:18\
at how you spend your time.\
3:20\
Invest time in your future\
and in that of your family.\
3:26\
If you have reasonable\
access to a temple,\
3:30\
I urge you to find a way to make\
an appointment regularly with\
3:33\
the Lord--to be in His holy\
house--and then keep that\
3:39\
appointment with\
exactness and joy.\
3:42\
I promise you that\
the Lord will bring\
3:44\
the miracles He knows you need\
as you make sacrifices to serve\
3:49\
and worship in His temples.\
3:53\
Currently we have 159\
dedicated temples.\
3:58\
The proper care and\
maintenance of those temples\
4:02\
is very important to us.\
4:05\
With the passage\
of time, temples\
4:08\
are inevitably in need of\
refreshing and renewal.\
4:11\
To that end, plans are now being\
made to renovate and update\
4:17\
the Salt Lake Temple and other\
pioneer-generation temples.\
4:23\
Details on these\
projects will be\
4:26\
shared as they are developed.\
4:30\
Today we are pleased\
to announce plans\
4:33\
to construct 12 more temples.\
4:40\
Those temples will be built\
in the following locations:\
4:45\
Mendoza, Argentina; Salvador,\
Brazil; Yuba City, California;\
5:05\
Phnom Penh, Cambodia;\
Praia, Cape Verde;\
5:16\
Yigo, Guam; Puebla, Mexico;\
Auckland, New Zealand;\
5:35\
Lagos, Nigeria; Davao,\
Philippines; San Juan, Puerto\
5:47\
Rico; Washington County, Utah.\

6:12\
Building and maintaining temples\
may not change your life,\
6:16\
but spending your time in\
the temple surely will.\
6:20\
To those who have long been\
absent from the temple,\
6:24\
I encourage you to prepare and\
return as soon as possible.\
6:29\
Then I invite you to worship\
in the temple and pray\
6:34\
to feel deeply the Savior's\
infinite love for you,\
6:40\
that each of you may gain your\
own testimony that He directs\
6:45\
this sacred and ageless work.\
6:50\
Brothers and\
sisters, I thank you\
6:52\
for your faith and\
sustaining efforts.\
6:55\
I leave my love and\
blessing upon you,\
6:58\
that you may feast upon\
the word of the Lord\
7:02\
and apply His teachings\
in your personal lives.\
7:06\
I assure you that revelation\
continues in the Church\
7:10\
and will continue until\
"the purposes of God\
7:14\
shall be accomplished,\
and the Great Jehovah\
7:17\
shall say the work is done."\
7:21\
I bless you with increased faith\
in Him and in His holy work,\
7:26\
with faith and patience to\
endure your personal challenges\
7:31\
in life.\
7:33\
I bless you to become\
exemplary Latter-day Saints.\
7:37\
I so bless you and bear my\
testimony that God lives!\
7:41\
Jesus is the Christ!\
7:43\
This is His Church.\
7:45\
We are His people.\
7:47\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
