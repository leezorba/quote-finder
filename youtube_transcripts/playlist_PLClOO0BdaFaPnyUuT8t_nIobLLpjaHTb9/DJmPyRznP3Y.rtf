My dear sisters, how\
wonderful to have\
0:04\
this new general conference\
session of women of the Church\
0:08\
eight years and older.\
0:11\
We have heard inspiring messages\
from the sister presidents\
0:17\
and from President Eyring.\
0:20\
President Eyring\
and I love working\
0:22\
under the direction of\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
0:25\
and we look forward to\
his prophetic address.\
0:31\
Children are our most precious\
gift from God--our eternal\
0:36\
increase.\
0:37\
Yet we live in a\
time when many women\
0:40\
wish to have no\
part in the bearing\
0:42\
and nurturing of children.\
0:43\
Many young adults delay\
marriage until temporal needs\
0:48\
are satisfied.\
0:49\
The average age of\
our Church members'\
0:52\
marriages has increased\
by more than two years,\
0:57\
and the number of births to\
Church members is falling.\
1:02\
The United States and\
some other nations\
1:05\
face a future of too few\
children maturing into adults\
1:10\
to support the number\
of retiring adults.\
1:13\
Over 40 percent of births\
in the United States\
1:18\
are to unwed mothers.\
1:21\
Those children are vulnerable.\
1:24\
Each of these trends\
works against our Father's\
1:28\
divine plan of salvation.\
1:32\
Latter-day Saint women\
understand that being a mother\
1:35\
is their highest priority,\
their ultimate joy.\
1:39\
President Gordon\
B. Hinckley said:\
1:43\
"Women for the most part see\
their greatest fulfillment,\
1:46\
their greatest happiness\
in home and family.\
1:50\
God planted within women\
something divine that\
1:53\
expresses itself in\
quiet strength, in\
1:58\
refinement, in peace, in\
goodness, in virtue, in truth,\
2:04\
in love.\
2:06\
And all of these\
remarkable qualities\
2:08\
find their truest\
and most satisfying\
2:11\
expression in motherhood."\
2:14\
He continued: "The greatest\
job that any woman will ever do\
2:19\
will be in nurturing\
and teaching and living\
2:22\
and encouraging and rearing\
her children in righteousness\
2:27\
and truth.\
2:28\
There is no other thing\
that will compare with that,\
2:31\
regardless of what she does."\
2:36\
Mothers, beloved sisters,\
we love you for who you are\
2:41\
and what you do for all of us.\
2:45\
In his important 2015 address\
titled "A Plea to My Sisters,"\
2:50\
President Russell\
M. Nelson said:\
2:54\
"The kingdom of God is not\
and cannot be complete without\
2:58\
women who make sacred\
covenants and then keep them,\
3:01\
women who can speak with the\
power and authority of God!\
3:06\
"Today, ... we need women who\
know how to make important\
3:09\
things happen by their faith\
and who are courageous defenders\
3:14\
of morality and families\
in a sin-sick world.\
3:19\
We need women who are devoted\
to shepherding God's children\
3:23\
along the covenant\
path toward exaltation;\
3:26\
women who know how to receive\
personal revelation, who\
3:30\
understand the power and\
peace of the temple endowment;\
3:34\
women who know how to call\
upon the powers of heaven\
3:37\
to protect and\
strengthen children\
3:39\
and families; women\
who teach fearlessly."\
3:47\
These inspired\
teachings are all based\
3:49\
on the "The Family: A\
Proclamation to the World,"\
3:53\
in which this restored\
Church reaffirms doctrine\
3:57\
and practices central\
to the Creator's plan\
4:01\
before He created the earth.\
4:06\
Now I address the younger\
group of this audience.\
4:09\
My dear young sisters,\
because of your knowledge\
4:13\
of the restored gospel of\
Jesus Christ, you are unique.\
4:18\
Your knowledge will enable\
you to endure and overcome\
4:23\
the difficulties of growing up.\
4:25\
From a young age,\
you have participated\
4:28\
in projects and programs that\
have developed your talents,\
4:32\
such as writing,\
speaking, and planning.\
4:35\
You have learned\
responsible behavior\
4:38\
and how to resist temptations\
to lie, cheat, steal, or use\
4:44\
alcohol or drugs.\
4:47\
Your uniqueness was\
recognized in a University\
4:50\
of North Carolina study of\
American teens and religion.\
4:57\
A Charlotte Observer\
article had the title\
5:02\
"Mormon teens cope best:\
Study finds they top peers\
5:08\
at handling adolescence."\
5:13\
This article concluded\
that "Mormons fared best\
5:17\
at avoiding risky behaviors,\
doing well in school,\
5:21\
and having a positive\
attitude about the future."\
5:25\
One of the researchers\
in the study,\
5:27\
who interviewed\
most of our youth,\
5:29\
said, "Across almost every\
category we looked at,\
5:35\
there was a clear pattern:\
Mormons were first."\
5:41\
Why do you cope best with the\
difficulties of growing up?\
5:45\
Young women, it is\
because you understand\
5:49\
our Heavenly Father's\
great plan of happiness.\
5:52\
This tells you who you are\
and the purpose of your life.\
5:56\
Youth with that\
understanding are\
5:59\
first in problem-solving and\
first in choosing the right.\
6:03\
You know you can have the\
Lord's help in overcoming all\
6:08\
the difficulties of growing up.\
6:12\
Another reason why\
you are most effective\
6:14\
is that you understand that\
you are children of a Heavenly\
6:17\
Father who loves you.\
6:19\
I am sure you are familiar\
with our great hymn "Dearest\
6:24\
Children, God Is near You."\
6:26\
Here is the first verse we\
all have sung and believed:\
6:32\
Dearest children,\
God is near you,\
6:36\
Watching o'er you day and night,\
6:39\
And delights to\
own and bless you,\
6:43\
If you strive to\
do what's right.\
6:48\
There are two teachings\
in that verse:\
6:49\
First, our Heavenly Father is\
near us and watches over us\
6:53\
day and night.\
6:54\
Think of it!\
6:55\
God loves us, He is near to\
us, and He watches over us.\
7:01\
Second, He delights\
to bless us as we\
7:04\
"strive to do what's right."\
7:07\
What comfort in the midst of\
our anxieties and difficulties!\
7:14\
Yes, young women, you are\
blessed, you are wonderful,\
7:18\
but you are like all of\
Heavenly Father's children\
7:21\
in your need to "strive\
to do what's right."\
7:25\
Here I could give you counsel\
on many different things,\
7:28\
but I have chosen to\
speak of only two.\
7:32\
My first counsel\
concerns cell phones.\
7:39\
A recent nationwide survey\
found that over half\
7:42\
of teens in the\
United States said\
7:46\
they spend too much time\
on their cell phones.\
7:50\
More than 40 percent\
said they felt anxious\
7:54\
when they were separated\
from their cell phones.\
7:57\
This was more common\
among girls than boys.\
8:02\
My young sisters--and adult\
women too--it will bless\
8:09\
your lives if you limit your\
use of and dependence on cell\
8:13\
phones.\
8:16\
My second counsel is\
even more important.\
8:19\
Be kind to others.\
8:23\
Kindness is something many of\
our youth are doing already.\
8:27\
Some groups of youth\
in some communities\
8:30\
have shown the\
way for all of us.\
8:33\
We have been inspired by our\
young people's acts of kindness\
8:37\
to those in need\
of love and help.\
8:40\
In many ways you give that\
help and show that love\
8:44\
to one another.\
8:45\
We wish all would\
follow your example.\
8:50\
At the same time, we know that\
the adversary tempts all of us\
8:53\
to be unkind, and there are\
still many examples of this,\
8:58\
even among children and youth.\
9:01\
Persistent unkindness\
is known by many names,\
9:06\
such as bullying,\
ganging up on someone,\
9:10\
or joining together\
to reject others.\
9:18\
These examples\
deliberately inflict pain\
9:21\
on classmates or friends.\
9:24\
My young sisters, it is\
not pleasing to the Lord\
9:27\
if we are cruel\
or mean to others.\
9:32\
Here is an example.\
9:34\
I know of a young\
man, a refugee here\
9:38\
in Utah, who was teased\
for being different,\
9:42\
including sometimes speaking\
his native language.\
9:46\
He was persecuted by a\
gang of privileged youth\
9:50\
until he retaliated\
in a way that\
9:53\
caused him to be\
jailed for over 70 days\
9:58\
while being considered\
for deportation.\
10:02\
I don't know what provoked this\
group of youth, many of them\
10:06\
Latter-day Saints\
like you, but I\
10:09\
can see the effect of their\
meanness, a tragic experience\
10:14\
and expense to one of\
the children of God.\
10:18\
Small actions of unkindness can\
have devastating consequences.\
10:26\
When I heard that\
story, I compared it\
10:27\
with what our prophet,\
President Nelson,\
10:30\
said in his recent\
worldwide youth devotional.\
10:33\
In asking you and\
all other youth\
10:36\
to assist in gathering\
Israel, he said: "Stand out;\
10:40\
be different from the world.\
10:42\
You and I know that you are\
to be a light to the world,"\
10:45\
he said.\
10:46\
"Therefore, the Lord needs\
you to look like, sound like,\
10:50\
act like, and dress like a\
true disciple of Jesus Christ."\
10:58\
The youth battalion President\
Nelson invited you to join\
11:01\
will not be mean to one another.\
11:04\
They will follow the\
Savior's teaching\
11:07\
to reach out and be loving and\
considerate of others, even\
11:12\
to turn the other cheek when\
we feel someone has wronged us.\
11:18\
In a general conference address\
about the time many of you\
11:21\
were born, President\
Gordon B. Hinckley\
11:24\
praised "beautiful\
young women who are\
11:27\
striving to live the gospel."\
11:29\
He described them just as\
I feel to describe you:\
11:34\
"They are generous\
toward one another.\
11:37\
They seek to\
strengthen one another.\
11:40\
They are a credit\
to their parents\
11:43\
and the homes from\
which they come.\
11:45\
They are approaching\
womanhood and will\
11:48\
carry throughout\
their lives the ideals\
11:51\
which presently motivate them."\
11:57\
As a servant of the Lord,\
I say to you young women,\
12:00\
our world needs your\
goodness and love.\
12:04\
Be kind to one another.\
12:07\
Jesus taught us to\
love one another\
12:10\
and to treat others as\
we want to be treated.\
12:14\
As we strive to be kind, we draw\
closer to Him and His loving\
12:20\
influence.\
12:22\
My dear sisters, if you\
participate in any meanness\
12:26\
or pettiness--individually\
or with a group--resolve now\
12:31\
to change and encourage\
others to change.\
12:35\
That is my counsel,\
and I give it\
12:37\
to you as a servant of\
the Lord Jesus Christ\
12:40\
because His Spirit\
has prompted me\
12:43\
to speak to you about\
this important subject.\
12:47\
I testify of Jesus\
Christ, our Savior,\
12:51\
who taught us to love one\
another as He loved us.\
12:56\
I pray that we will do so, in\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
