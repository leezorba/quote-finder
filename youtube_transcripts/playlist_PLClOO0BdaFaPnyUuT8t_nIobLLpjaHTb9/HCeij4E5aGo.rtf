We all remember last April\
when President Russell M.\
0:05\
Nelson introduced this\
concept of ministering.\
0:08\
He stressed that it\
was a way to keep\
0:13\
the great commandments to\
love God and love each other.\
0:18\
We as officers of the Church\
openly applaud and congratulate\
0:25\
you on the tremendous\
response you\
0:27\
have made and begun\
in that regard.\
0:30\
We thank you for following\
our beloved prophet\
0:34\
in this wonderful\
endeavor and suggest\
0:38\
that you don't wait for\
many more instructions.\
0:41\
Just jump into\
the pool and swim.\
0:44\
Head toward those in need.\
0:46\
Don't be immobilized\
wondering whether you\
0:49\
should do the backstroke\
or the dog paddle.\
0:52\
If we follow the basic\
principles that have been\
0:55\
taught, stay aligned\
with priesthood keys,\
0:58\
and seek the Holy Spirit to\
guide us, we cannot fail.\
1:03\
Thank you, Sister Cordon,\
for that great message.\
1:07\
This morning I wish to speak\
of an even more personal aspect\
1:11\
of ministering that isn't\
by assignment, that does not\
1:16\
involve a calendared\
interview, and has no reporting\
1:20\
line except to heaven.\
1:22\
Let me share just\
one homespun example\
1:27\
of that kind of ministering.\
1:30\
Grant Morrell Bowen was a\
hardworking, devoted husband\
1:35\
and father who, like many,\
made their living on the land\
1:39\
and had an economic downturn\
when the local potato\
1:42\
crop was poor.\
1:44\
He and his wife, Norma,\
took other employment,\
1:48\
eventually moved\
to another city,\
1:51\
and started their climb\
back to economic stability.\
1:55\
However, in a terribly\
unfortunate incident,\
2:01\
Brother Bowen was\
deeply hurt when\
2:04\
in a temple recommend\
interview, the bishop\
2:07\
was a little skeptical\
regarding Morrell's declaration\
2:12\
that he was a full-tithe payer.\
2:15\
I do not know which\
of these two men\
2:18\
had the more accurate\
facts that day,\
2:20\
but I do know Sister\
Bowen walked out\
2:24\
of that interview with her\
temple recommend renewed,\
2:28\
while Brother Bowen walked\
out with an anger that\
2:33\
would take him away from\
the Church for 15 years.\
2:39\
Regardless of who was\
right about the tithing,\
2:41\
evidently both\
Morrell and the bishop\
2:44\
forgot the Savior's injunction\
to "agree with thine adversary\
2:49\
quickly" and Paul's\
counsel to "let not\
2:54\
the sun go down\
upon your wrath."\
2:56\
The fact is they didn't\
agree, and the sun\
3:01\
did go down on Brother\
Bowen's wrath for days\
3:05\
and then for weeks\
and then for years,\
3:09\
proving the point made by one\
of the wisest of the old Romans\
3:15\
who said, "Anger,\
if not restrained,\
3:20\
is frequently more [destructive]\
than the injury that\
3:24\
provoked it."\
3:26\
But the miracle\
of reconciliation\
3:29\
is always available to us,\
and out of love for his family\
3:34\
and the Church he\
knew to be true,\
3:36\
Morrell Bowen came back\
into full Church activity.\
3:40\
Let me tell you briefly\
how that happened.\
3:45\
Brother Bowen's son Brad\
is a good friend of ours\
3:48\
and a devoted Area Seventy\
serving in southern Idaho.\
3:53\
Brad was 11 years old at\
the time of this incident,\
3:57\
and for 15 years he watched\
his father's religious devotion\
4:03\
decline, a witness to\
the terrible harvest\
4:07\
being reaped where anger and\
misunderstanding had been sown.\
4:12\
Something needed to be done.\
4:16\
So as the Thanksgiving holiday\
approached in 1977, Brad,\
4:23\
a 26-year-old student at\
Brigham Young University;\
4:26\
his wife, Valerie;\
and new baby son,\
4:29\
Mic, loaded into\
their student version\
4:32\
of an automobile and, bad\
weather notwithstanding,\
4:37\
drove to Billings, Montana.\
4:39\
Not even a crash into a\
snowbank near West Yellowstone\
4:43\
could keep this threesome\
from making their ministering\
4:47\
contact with Brother Bowen Sr.\
4:51\
Upon arrival, Brad\
and his sister Pam\
4:55\
asked for a private\
moment with their father.\
4:59\
"You have been a wonderful dad,"\
Brad began with some emotion,\
5:05\
"and we have always known\
how much you loved us.\
5:09\
But something is wrong, and\
it has been for a long time.\
5:15\
Because you were hurt\
once, this whole family\
5:20\
has been hurting for years.\
5:23\
We are broken, and you are\
the only one who can fix us.\
5:29\
Please, please,\
after all this time,\
5:35\
can you find it in your heart\
to lay aside that unfortunate\
5:41\
incident with that\
bishop and again lead\
5:46\
this family in the\
gospel as you once did?"\
5:54\
There was dead silence.\
5:58\
Then Brother Bowen looked up\
at these two--his children,\
6:02\
bone of his bone and flesh\
of his flesh--and said very\
6:08\
quietly, "Yes.\
6:11\
Yes, I will."\
6:15\
Thrilled but stunned by\
the unexpected answer,\
6:20\
Brad Bowen and\
his family watched\
6:24\
their husband and father\
go to his current bishop\
6:28\
in a spirit of reconciliation\
to set things right in his life.\
6:34\
In a perfect response to\
this courageous but totally\
6:39\
unexpected visit, the bishop,\
who had extended repeated\
6:44\
invitations to Brother\
Bowen to come back,\
6:47\
threw his arms around Morrell\
and just held him--held him\
6:56\
in a long, long, long embrace.\
7:03\
In a matter of only a few\
weeks--it doesn't take\
7:06\
long--Brother Bowen was fully\
engaged in Church activity\
7:11\
and had made himself worthy\
to return to the temple.\
7:15\
Soon enough he accepted\
the call to preside over\
7:19\
a struggling little\
branch of 25 and grew it\
7:23\
into a thriving congregation\
of well over 100.\
7:26\
All of this took place\
nearly half a century ago,\
7:31\
but the consequence of\
a son and a daughter's\
7:36\
ministering plea\
to their own father\
7:40\
and that father's willingness\
to forgive and move forward\
7:46\
in spite of the\
imperfections of others\
7:50\
has brought blessings\
that are still coming\
7:53\
and will come forever\
to the Bowen family.\
7:59\
Brothers and sisters,\
Jesus has asked\
8:03\
that we "live together in\
love" with "no disputations\
8:09\
among you."\
8:11\
"He that hath the spirit of\
contention is not of me,"\
8:16\
He warned the Nephites.\
8:19\
Indeed, to a great degree, our\
relationship to Christ will be\
8:25\
determined--or at least\
affected--by our relationship\
8:30\
to each other.\
8:33\
"If ye ... desire to\
come unto me," He said,\
8:37\
"and rememberest that thy\
brother hath aught against\
8:41\
thee--\
8:42\
"Go thy way unto thy\
brother, and first\
8:47\
be reconciled to [him],\
and then come unto me\
8:53\
with full purpose of heart,\
and I will receive you."\
9:00\
Surely each of us could\
cite an endless array\
9:06\
of old scars and sorrows\
and painful memories\
9:11\
that this very\
moment still corrode\
9:15\
the peace in someone's heart\
or family or neighborhood.\
9:20\
Whether we have caused that pain\
or been the recipient of it,\
9:26\
those wounds need to be healed\
so life can be as rewarding\
9:31\
as God intended it to be.\
9:34\
Like the food in\
your refrigerator\
9:37\
that your grandchildren\
carefully check in your behalf,\
9:41\
those old grievances\
have long since\
9:45\
exceeded their expiration date.\
9:48\
Please don't give precious\
space in your soul\
9:53\
to them any longer.\
9:55\
As Prospero said to\
the regretful Alonso\
10:00\
in The Tempest, "Let us\
not burden our remembrance\
10:06\
with a heaviness that is gone."\
10:11\
"Forgive, and ye\
shall be forgiven,"\
10:13\
Christ taught in the\
Sermon on the Mount.\
10:15\
And in our day:\
"I, the Lord, will\
10:18\
forgive whom I will\
forgive, but of you\
10:22\
it is required to\
forgive all men."\
10:25\
It is, however,\
important for some of you\
10:29\
living in real anguish to\
note what He did not say.\
10:33\
He did not say,\
"You are not allowed\
10:36\
to feel true pain or real sorrow\
from the shattering experiences\
10:41\
you have had at the\
hand of another."\
10:43\
Nor did He say, "In\
order to forgive fully,\
10:47\
you have to reenter\
a toxic relationship\
10:50\
or return to an abusive,\
destructive circumstance."\
10:54\
But notwithstanding even\
the most terrible offenses\
10:59\
that might come to us, we\
can rise above our pain\
11:04\
only when we put our feet\
onto the path of true healing.\
11:09\
That path is the\
forgiving one walked\
11:14\
by Jesus of Nazareth, who\
calls out to each of us,\
11:19\
"Come, follow me."\
11:24\
In such an invitation to be His\
disciple and try to do as He\
11:30\
did, Jesus is asking us to be\
instruments of His grace--to\
11:37\
be, and I quote,\
"ambassadors for Christ"\
11:41\
in "the ministry\
of reconciliation."\
11:45\
That's how Paul described\
it to the Corinthians.\
11:49\
The Healer of every wound,\
He who rights every wrong,\
11:55\
asks us to labor with\
Him in the daunting task\
12:00\
of peacemaking in a world that\
will not find it any other way.\
12:09\
So, as Phillips Brooks wrote:\
"You who are letting miserable\
12:15\
[little] misunderstandings run\
on from year to year [to year],\
12:20\
meaning to clear\
them up some day;\
12:23\
you who are keeping wretched\
quarrels alive because you\
12:30\
cannot quite make up your\
mind that now is the day\
12:34\
to sacrifice your pride\
and [settle] them;\
12:37\
you who are passing men\
sullenly upon the street,\
12:42\
not speaking to them out\
of some silly spite ...;\
12:46\
you who are letting ...\
[someone's] heart ache\
12:50\
for a word of\
appreciation or sympathy,\
12:54\
which you mean to\
give ... some day, ...\
12:57\
[you] go instantly and do the\
thing which you might never\
13:05\
have another chance to do."\
13:11\
My beloved brothers\
and sisters, I\
13:14\
testify that forgiving and\
forsaking offenses, old or new,\
13:21\
is central to the grandeur of\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
13:26\
I testify that ultimately\
such spiritual repair can only\
13:34\
come from our divine Redeemer,\
He who rushes to our aid\
13:40\
"with healing in his wings."\
13:43\
We thank Him and our Heavenly\
Father, who sent Him,\
13:49\
that renewal and rebirth--a\
future free from old sorrows\
13:55\
and past mistakes--are\
not only possible,\
14:00\
but they've already\
been purchased,\
14:03\
paid for at an excruciating\
cost symbolized by the blood\
14:11\
of the Lamb who shed it.\
14:15\
With the apostolic\
authority granted me\
14:19\
by the Savior of\
the world, I testify\
14:24\
of the tranquility to the\
soul that reconciliation\
14:30\
with God and each\
other will bring\
14:34\
if we are meek and courageous\
enough to pursue it.\
14:41\
"Cease to contend one with\
another," the Savior pled.\
14:47\
So if you know of an\
old injury, repair it.\
14:54\
Care for one another in love.\
15:00\
My beloved friends,\
in our shared ministry\
15:06\
of reconciliation, I ask us to\
be peacemakers, to love peace,\
15:15\
to seek peace, to cherish\
peace, to create peace.\
15:23\
I make that appeal in the\
name of the Prince of Peace,\
15:30\
who knows everything about being\
"wounded in the house of [His]\
15:37\
friends" but who still found\
the strength to forgive\
15:45\
and forget--and to\
heal and be happy.\
15:52\
For that I pray\
for you and for me\
15:57\
in the name of the Lord\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
