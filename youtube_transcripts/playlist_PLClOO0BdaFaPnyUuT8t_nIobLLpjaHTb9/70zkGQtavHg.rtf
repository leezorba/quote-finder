A rope is an essential tool with\
which all of us are familiar.\
0:05\
Ropes are made from strands\
of fabric, plants, wire,\
0:09\
or other materials that are\
each individually twisted\
0:13\
or braided together.\
0:15\
Interestingly, substances that\
may be quite unexceptional\
0:20\
can be woven together and\
become exceptionally strong.\
0:24\
Thus, effectively connecting\
and binding ordinary materials\
0:30\
can produce an\
extraordinary tool.\
0:33\
Just as a rope\
obtains its strength\
0:36\
from many intertwined\
individual strands,\
0:39\
so the gospel of Jesus\
Christ provides the greatest\
0:43\
perspective of truth and\
offers the richest blessings\
0:47\
as we heed the\
admonition of Paul\
0:49\
to "gather together in\
one all things in Christ,\
0:54\
both which are in heaven,\
and which are on earth;\
0:57\
even in him."\
1:00\
Importantly, this vital\
gathering of truth\
1:03\
is centered in and focused\
upon the Lord Jesus Christ\
1:07\
because He is "the way,\
the truth, and the life."\
1:13\
I pray that the Holy Ghost\
will enlighten each of us\
1:16\
as we consider how the principle\
of gathering together in one\
1:21\
all things in Christ applies\
in practical ways to learning\
1:26\
and living His restored\
gospel in our daily lives.\
1:31\
We live in a remarkable\
and revelatory season\
1:35\
of the restored Church\
of Jesus Christ.\
1:39\
The historic adjustments\
announced today\
1:42\
have only one\
overarching purpose:\
1:45\
to strengthen faith in\
Heavenly Father and His plan\
1:49\
and in His Son, Jesus\
Christ, and His Atonement.\
1:53\
The Sunday meeting schedule\
was not simply shortened.\
1:59\
Rather, we now have\
increased opportunities\
2:03\
and responsibilities as\
individuals and families\
2:07\
to use our time for enhancing\
the Sabbath as a delight\
2:11\
at home and at Church.\
2:15\
Last April, the organizational\
structure of priesthood quorums\
2:19\
was not merely changed.\
2:22\
Rather, emphasis\
and strength were\
2:24\
given to a higher and holier way\
of ministering to our brothers\
2:29\
and sisters.\
2:31\
Much like the braided\
strands of a rope\
2:33\
produce a powerful\
and durable tool,\
2:36\
all of these\
interrelated actions\
2:39\
are part of a unified\
effort to better align\
2:43\
the focus, resources, and work\
of the Savior's restored Church\
2:47\
with its fundamental mission:\
to assist God in His work\
2:53\
to bring to pass the salvation\
and exaltation of His children.\
2:58\
Please do not focus primarily\
upon the logistical aspects\
3:04\
of what has been announced.\
3:06\
We must not allow\
procedural details\
3:09\
to obscure the overarching\
spiritual reasons these changes\
3:14\
now are being made.\
3:17\
Our desire is that faith\
in the Father's plan\
3:20\
and in the Savior's\
redeeming mission\
3:23\
might increase in the earth and\
that God's everlasting covenant\
3:27\
might be established.\
3:29\
Our only objectives\
are to facilitate\
3:32\
continuing conversion\
to the Lord\
3:35\
and to love more completely\
and serve more effectively\
3:40\
our brothers and sisters.\
3:43\
Sometimes as members\
of the Church\
3:45\
we segment, separate, and\
apply the gospel in our lives\
3:49\
by creating lengthy checklists\
of individual topics to study\
3:54\
and tasks to accomplish.\
3:56\
But such an approach potentially\
can constrain our understanding\
4:01\
and vision.\
4:03\
We must be careful\
because pharisaical focus\
4:06\
upon checklists can divert\
us from drawing closer\
4:10\
to the Lord.\
4:12\
The purpose and purification,\
the happiness and joy,\
4:17\
and the continuing conversion\
and protection that come from\
4:21\
"yielding [our] hearts unto\
God" and "[receiving] his image\
4:25\
in [our] countenances" cannot\
be obtained merely by performing\
4:31\
and checking off all the\
spiritual things we are\
4:33\
supposed to do.\
4:35\
Rather, the power of\
the Savior's gospel\
4:38\
to transform and bless us flows\
from discerning and applying\
4:44\
the interrelatedness of\
its doctrine, principles,\
4:48\
and practices.\
4:50\
Only as we gather together\
in one all things in Christ,\
4:54\
with firm focus upon Him, can\
gospel truths synergistically\
5:01\
enable us to become what God\
desires us to become and endure\
5:06\
valiantly to the end.\
5:10\
The gospel of Jesus Christ\
is a magnificent tapestry\
5:13\
of truth "fitly framed"\
and woven together.\
5:17\
As we learn and link together\
revealed gospel truths,\
5:21\
we are blessed to receive\
precious perspective\
5:24\
and increased spiritual\
capacity through eyes\
5:29\
that can see the Lord's\
influence in our lives and ears\
5:33\
that can hear His voice.\
5:35\
And the principle of gathering\
together in one--even\
5:39\
in Him--can assist us in\
changing the traditional\
5:43\
checklists into a unified,\
integrated, and complete whole.\
5:50\
Let me provide both a\
doctrinal and a Church example\
5:54\
of what I am suggesting.\
5:57\
Example number 1.\
5:58\
The fourth article\
of faith is one\
6:01\
of the greatest illustrations\
of gathering together in one\
6:06\
all things in\
Christ: "We believe\
6:10\
that the first principles\
and ordinances of the Gospel\
6:13\
are: first, Faith in\
the Lord Jesus Christ;\
6:16\
second, Repentance; third,\
Baptism by immersion\
6:20\
for the remission\
of sins; fourth,\
6:23\
Laying on of hands for the\
gift of the Holy Ghost."\
6:27\
True faith is focused in and on\
the Lord Jesus Christ--in Him\
6:34\
as the Divine and Only Begotten\
Son of the Father and on Him\
6:40\
and the redemptive\
mission He fulfilled.\
6:43\
"For he hath answered\
the ends of the law,\
6:46\
and he claimeth all those\
who have faith in him;\
6:50\
and they who have faith\
in him will cleave\
6:52\
unto every good\
thing; wherefore he\
6:55\
advocateth the cause of\
the children of men."\
6:59\
Exercising faith in Christ\
is trusting and placing\
7:05\
our confidence in Him as\
our Savior, on His name,\
7:09\
and in His promises.\
7:12\
The first and\
natural consequence\
7:14\
of trusting in the Savior\
is repenting and turning\
7:17\
away from evil.\
7:19\
As we exercise faith\
in and on the Lord,\
7:23\
we naturally turn toward, come\
unto, and depend upon Him.\
7:28\
Thus, repentance is trusting in\
and relying upon the Redeemer\
7:36\
to do for us what we\
cannot do for ourselves.\
7:39\
Each of us must "[rely] wholly\
upon the merits of him who is\
7:43\
mighty to save" because only\
"through the merits, and mercy,\
7:47\
and grace of the Holy Messiah"\
can we become new creatures\
7:51\
in Christ and ultimately return\
to and dwell in the presence\
7:56\
of God.\
7:59\
The ordinance of\
baptism by immersion\
8:00\
for the remission of sins\
requires us to trust in Him,\
8:06\
rely upon Him, and follow Him.\
8:10\
Nephi proclaimed:\
8:13\
"I know that if ye\
shall follow the Son,\
8:15\
with full purpose of heart,\
acting no hypocrisy and no\
8:20\
deception before God,\
but with real intent,\
8:23\
repenting of your sins,\
witnessing unto the Father that\
8:28\
ye are willing to take upon\
you the name of Christ,\
8:30\
by baptism--yea, by following\
your Lord and your Savior down\
8:37\
into the water, according\
to his word, behold,\
8:41\
then shall ye receive\
the Holy Ghost; yea,\
8:44\
then cometh the baptism of\
fire and ... the Holy Ghost."\
8:50\
The ordinance of\
laying on of hands\
8:51\
for the gift of the Holy Ghost\
requires us to trust in Him,\
8:56\
rely upon Him, follow\
Him, and press forward\
9:03\
in Him with the assistance\
of His Holy Spirit.\
9:07\
As Nephi declared, "And now ...\
9:10\
I know by this that unless a\
man shall endure to the end,\
9:14\
in following the example of\
the Son of the living God,\
9:17\
he cannot be saved."\
9:21\
The fourth article of\
faith does not simply\
9:24\
identify the fundamental\
principles and ordinances\
9:27\
of the restored gospel.\
9:29\
Rather, this inspired statement\
of belief gathers together\
9:35\
in one all things in Christ:\
trusting in and on Him,\
9:40\
relying upon Him, following\
Him, and pressing forward with\
9:47\
Him--even in Him.\
9:51\
Example number 2.\
9:53\
I now want to describe\
how all Church programs\
9:56\
and initiatives are gathered\
together in one in Christ.\
10:02\
Many additional illustrations\
could be presented;\
10:06\
I will use only a selected few.\
10:10\
In 1978, President\
Spencer W. Kimball\
10:13\
instructed members of the\
Church to build up the strength\
10:17\
of Zion throughout the world.\
10:19\
He counseled the Saints to\
remain in their native lands\
10:24\
and establish strong stakes\
by gathering the family of God\
10:28\
and teaching them\
the ways of the Lord.\
10:31\
He further indicated\
that more temples\
10:33\
would be built and\
promised blessings\
10:35\
for the Saints wherever\
they lived in the world.\
10:40\
As the number of\
stakes increased,\
10:42\
the need was intensified\
for member homes\
10:44\
to "become [places] where\
family members [loved]\
10:48\
to be, where they [could]\
enrich their lives\
10:51\
and find mutual love,\
support, appreciation,\
10:54\
and encouragement."\
10:55\
Consequently, in\
1980, Sunday meetings\
11:00\
were consolidated into\
a three-hour block\
11:03\
to "reemphasize\
personal and family\
11:06\
responsibility for\
learning, living,\
11:09\
and teaching the gospel."\
11:11\
This emphasis on\
family and the home\
11:14\
was again affirmed in "The\
Family: A Proclamation\
11:17\
to the World," introduced\
by President Gordon\
11:20\
B. Hinckley in 1995.\
11:24\
In April of 1998,\
President Hinckley\
11:27\
announced the construction\
of many more small temples,\
11:31\
thereby bringing the sacred\
ordinances of the Lord's house\
11:34\
closer to Latter-day Saint\
individuals and families\
11:38\
throughout the world.\
11:40\
And these enhanced opportunities\
for spiritual growth\
11:43\
and development\
were complemented\
11:46\
by related increases in\
temporal self-reliance\
11:50\
through the introduction of\
the Perpetual Education Fund\
11:53\
in 2001.\
11:56\
During his administration,\
President Thomas S. Monson\
11:59\
repeatedly exhorted the\
Saints to go "to the rescue"\
12:03\
and emphasized caring\
for the poor and needy\
12:07\
as one of the Church's divinely\
appointed responsibilities.\
12:11\
Continuing the emphasis\
on temporal preparation,\
12:15\
the Self-Reliance\
Services initiative\
12:17\
was implemented in 2012.\
12:22\
Over the past several\
years, essential principles\
12:24\
about making the Sabbath\
day a delight in the home\
12:28\
and at Church have been\
emphasized and reinforced,\
12:32\
thus preparing us for\
the Sunday meeting\
12:35\
schedule announced in this\
session of general conference.\
12:39\
And six months ago,\
Melchizedek Priesthood quorums\
12:43\
were strengthened and\
aligned more effectively\
12:45\
with the auxiliaries to\
accomplish a higher and holier\
12:50\
approach to ministering.\
12:53\
Brothers and sisters, I believe\
that the sequence and timing\
12:58\
of these actions\
over many decades\
13:01\
can help us to see one united\
and comprehensive work and not\
13:07\
just a series of independent\
and discrete initiatives.\
13:12\
"God has revealed a pattern\
of spiritual progress\
13:16\
for individuals and families\
through ordinances, teaching,\
13:20\
programs, and activities\
that are home centered\
13:24\
and Church supported.\
13:26\
Church organizations\
and programs\
13:28\
exist to bless\
individuals and families\
13:31\
and are not ends in themselves."\
13:36\
I pray we can recognize\
the Lord's work\
13:39\
as one great worldwide work\
that is becoming ever more home\
13:46\
centered and Church supported.\
13:48\
I know and I testify that\
the Lord is revealing\
13:52\
and will yet reveal many great\
and important things pertaining\
13:56\
to the kingdom of God.\
13:59\
I began my message by\
highlighting the strength that\
14:02\
is created as individual\
strands of material are twisted\
14:07\
or braided together into a rope.\
14:09\
In a similar way, I promise that\
increased perspective, purpose,\
14:15\
and power will be evident\
in our learning and living\
14:20\
of the restored gospel of Jesus\
Christ as we strive to gather\
14:25\
together in one all things\
in Christ--even in Him.\
14:33\
All opportunities and blessings\
of eternal consequence\
14:37\
originate in, are possible\
and have purpose because of,\
14:42\
and endure through\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
14:45\
As Alma testified: "There\
is no other way or means\
14:50\
whereby man can be saved,\
only in and through Christ.\
14:55\
Behold, he is the life and\
the light of the world."\
15:02\
I joyfully declare my witness of\
the divinity and living reality\
15:09\
of the Eternal Father and of\
His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.\
15:15\
In our Savior, we find joy.\
15:19\
And in Him we find the assurance\
of "peace in this world,\
15:25\
and eternal life in\
the world to come."\
15:28\
I so testify in the sacred name\
of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
