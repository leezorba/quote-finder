After last general\
conference, many people\
0:03\
approached me with\
the same question:\
0:06\
"Are those chairs comfortable?"\
0:08\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:11\
My answer was the\
same every time:\
0:14\
"Those chairs are very\
comfortable if you\
0:16\
don't have to speak."\
0:17\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:19\
It's true, right?\
0:22\
My chair has not been as\
comfortable this conference,\
0:26\
but I am truly grateful\
for the blessing\
0:29\
and the honor of speaking\
to you this evening.\
0:33\
Sometimes as we serve, we get\
to sit in different seats.\
0:37\
Some are quite comfy and\
some other ones are not,\
0:40\
but we have promised\
our Father in Heaven\
0:44\
that we will serve Him\
and others with love\
0:48\
and do His will in all things.\
0:52\
A few years ago, youth in the\
Church learned that "when you\
0:56\
'embark in the service of God,'\
you're joining the greatest\
1:01\
journey ever.\
1:02\
You're helping God\
hasten His work,\
1:05\
and it's a great, joyful,\
and marvelous experience."\
1:10\
It's a journey available to\
all--of any age--and is also\
1:14\
a journey that takes us along\
what our beloved prophet has\
1:19\
spoken of as "the\
covenant path."\
1:23\
Unfortunately, however,\
we live in a selfish world\
1:27\
where people constantly\
ask, "What's in it for me?"\
1:31\
instead of asking,\
"Whom can I help today?"\
1:35\
or "How can I better serve\
the Lord in my calling?"\
1:38\
or "Am I giving my\
all to the Lord?"\
1:42\
A great example in my\
life of unselfish service\
1:46\
is Sister Victoria Antonietti.\
1:49\
Victoria was one of the\
Primary teachers in my branch\
1:54\
while I was growing\
up in Argentina.\
1:56\
Each Tuesday afternoon when\
we gathered for Primary,\
2:00\
she brought us a chocolate cake.\
2:03\
Everyone loved the cake--well,\
everyone except me.\
2:07\
I hated chocolate cake!\
2:11\
And even though she would try\
to share the cake with me,\
2:15\
I always turned down her offer.\
2:18\
One day after she had shared\
the chocolate cake with the rest\
2:22\
of the children, I asked\
her, "Why don't you bring\
2:25\
a different flavor--like\
orange or vanilla?"\
2:29\
I know.\
2:30\
After laughing a\
little, she asked me,\
2:33\
"Why don't you try\
a little piece?\
2:35\
This cake is made with\
a special ingredient,\
2:39\
and I promise that if you\
try it, you will like it!"\
2:44\
I looked around,\
and to my surprise,\
2:46\
everyone seemed to\
be enjoying the cake.\
2:48\
So I agreed to give it a try.\
2:51\
Can you guess what happened?\
2:53\
I liked it!\
2:55\
That was the very first time\
I had enjoyed chocolate cake.\
3:00\
It wasn't until many years\
later that I found out\
3:04\
what the secret ingredient\
was in Sister Antonietti's\
3:08\
chocolate cake.\
3:09\
My children and I visited\
my mother each week.\
3:13\
On one of these\
visits Mom and I were\
3:16\
enjoying a slice\
of chocolate cake,\
3:18\
and I related to her how I came\
to like the cake for the very\
3:23\
first time.\
3:25\
Then she enlightened me\
with the rest of the story.\
3:29\
"You see, Cris," my mom said,\
"Victoria and her family\
3:32\
didn't have a lot of\
resources, and each week she\
3:36\
had to choose between\
paying for the bus\
3:38\
to take her and her\
four children to Primary\
3:43\
or buying the ingredients\
to make the chocolate\
3:47\
cake for her Primary class.\
3:50\
She always chose the\
chocolate cake over the bus,\
3:56\
and she and her children walked\
more than two miles each way,\
4:03\
regardless of the weather."\
4:07\
That day I had a\
better appreciation\
4:09\
for her chocolate cake.\
4:11\
More important, I learned\
that the secret ingredient\
4:15\
in Victoria's cake\
was the love that she\
4:18\
had for those she served\
and her unselfish sacrifice\
4:22\
in our behalf.\
4:25\
Thinking back on\
Victoria's cake helps\
4:28\
me remember an\
unselfish sacrifice\
4:31\
in the timeless lessons taught\
by the Lord to His disciples\
4:35\
as He walked toward the\
treasury of the temple.\
4:39\
You know the story.\
4:43\
Elder James E. Talmage taught\
that there were 13 chests,\
4:47\
"and into these\
[chests] the people\
4:49\
dropped their contributions\
for the [different] purposes\
4:53\
indicated by [the]\
inscriptions on the boxes."\
4:56\
Jesus watched the lines\
of donors, made up\
5:01\
of all different\
types of people.\
5:03\
Some gave their gifts with\
"sincerity of purpose"\
5:08\
while others cast in "great\
sums of silver and gold,"\
5:12\
hoping to be seen, noticed, and\
praised for their donations.\
5:18\
"Among the many was\
a poor widow, who ...\
5:22\
dropped into one of the\
treasure-chests two small\
5:25\
bronze coins known as mites; her\
contribution amounted to less\
5:31\
than half a cent\
in American money.\
5:34\
The Lord called His\
disciples about Him,\
5:37\
directed their attention to the\
poverty-stricken widow and her\
5:42\
deed, and said:\
'Verily I say unto you,\
5:46\
That this poor widow hath cast\
more in, than all they which\
5:51\
have cast into the treasury:\
for all they did cast\
5:56\
in of their abundance; but she\
of her want did cast in all\
6:01\
that she had, even\
all [of] her living.'"\
6:05\
The widow did not appear to\
hold a noticeable position\
6:09\
in the society of her time.\
6:11\
She actually held\
something more important:\
6:14\
her intentions were pure, and\
she gave all she had to give.\
6:20\
Perhaps she gave\
less than others,\
6:24\
more quietly than others,\
differently than others.\
6:28\
In the eyes of some, what\
she gave was insignificant,\
6:32\
but in the eyes of the\
Savior, the "discerner of ...\
6:36\
thoughts and intents of the\
heart," she gave her all.\
6:41\
Sisters, are we giving\
our all to the Lord\
6:44\
without reservations?\
6:46\
Are we sacrificing of\
our time and talents\
6:49\
so the rising generation\
can learn to love the Lord\
6:53\
and keep His commandments?\
6:55\
Are we ministering both to those\
around us and to those we are\
7:00\
assigned with care and with\
diligence--sacrificing time\
7:05\
and energy that could\
be used in other ways?\
7:08\
Are we living the two great\
commandments--to love God\
7:12\
and to love His children?\
7:14\
Often that love is\
manifest as service.\
7:21\
President Dallin H. Oaks\
taught: "Our Savior gave Himself\
7:25\
in unselfish service.\
7:27\
He taught that each of\
us should follow Him\
7:30\
by denying ourselves\
of selfish interests\
7:34\
in order to serve others."\
7:36\
He continued:\
7:37\
"A familiar example of losing\
ourselves in the service\
7:41\
of others ... is the\
sacrifice parents make\
7:44\
for their children.\
7:46\
Mothers suffer pain and\
loss of personal priorities\
7:50\
and comforts to bear\
and rear each child.\
7:54\
Fathers adjust their lives and\
priorities to support a family.\
7:58\
...\
7:59\
"...\
8:00\
We also rejoice in those\
who care for disabled family\
8:03\
members and aged parents.\
8:06\
None of this service\
asks, what's in it for me?\
8:09\
All of it requires setting\
aside personal convenience\
8:13\
for unselfish service.\
8:15\
...\
8:16\
"[And] all of this illustrates\
the eternal principle that we\
8:22\
are happier and more fulfilled\
when we act and serve for what\
8:27\
we give, not for what we get.\
8:32\
"Our Savior teaches\
us to follow Him\
8:35\
by making the sacrifices\
necessary to lose ourselves\
8:40\
in unselfish service to others."\
8:44\
President Thomas S. Monson\
likewise taught that "perhaps\
8:48\
when we make face-to-face\
contact with our Maker,\
8:52\
we will not be asked, 'How\
many positions did you hold?'\
8:56\
but rather, 'How many\
people did you help?'\
9:00\
In reality, you can\
never love the Lord\
9:04\
until you serve Him by\
serving His people."\
9:08\
In other words,\
sisters, it will not\
9:11\
matter if we sat\
in the comfy seats\
9:13\
or if we struggled to\
get through the meeting\
9:16\
on a rusty folding\
chair in the back row.\
9:19\
It won't even matter if we, of\
necessity, stepped into a foyer\
9:24\
to comfort a crying baby.\
9:26\
What will matter is that we\
came with a desire to serve,\
9:31\
that we noticed those to whom\
we minister and greeted them\
9:35\
joyfully, and that we introduced\
ourselves to those sharing\
9:40\
our row of folding\
chairs--reaching out with\
9:43\
friendship even though we aren't\
assigned to minister to them.\
9:48\
And it will certainly\
matter that we do all\
9:52\
that we do with the special\
ingredient of service coupled\
9:57\
with love and sacrifice.\
10:00\
I have come to know that we\
don't have to make a chocolate\
10:04\
cake to be a successful and\
dedicated Primary teacher,\
10:08\
because it was not\
about the cake.\
10:11\
It was the love\
behind the action.\
10:16\
I testify that that love is made\
sacred through sacrifice--the\
10:22\
sacrifice of a teacher and\
even more through the ultimate\
10:27\
and eternal sacrifice\
of the Son of God.\
10:30\
I bear witness that He lives!\
10:33\
I love Him and desire to put\
away selfish desires in order\
10:40\
to love and minister as He does.\
10:42\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
