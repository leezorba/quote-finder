On March 22, 2016, just\
before 8:00 in the morning,\
0:06\
two terrorist bombs exploded\
in the Brussels Airport.\
0:10\
Elder Richard Norby, Elder Mason\
Wells, and Elder Joseph Empey\
0:15\
had taken Sister Fanny\
Clain to the airport\
0:17\
for a flight for her\
mission in Cleveland, Ohio.\
0:21\
Thirty-two people\
lost their lives,\
0:24\
and all of the\
missionaries were wounded.\
0:27\
The most seriously wounded was\
Elder Richard Norby, age 66,\
0:31\
serving with his wife,\
Sister Pam Norby.\
0:35\
Elder Norby reflected\
on that moment:\
0:39\
"Instantly, I knew\
what had happened.\
0:41\
"I tried to run for safety, but\
I immediately fell down. ...\
0:45\
I could see that my left\
leg was badly injured.\
0:48\
I [noticed] black, almost\
spiderweb-type, soot drooping\
0:53\
from both hands.\
0:55\
I gently pulled\
at it but realized\
0:58\
it was not soot but my\
skin that had been burned.\
1:02\
My white shirt was turning\
red from an injury on my back.\
1:09\
"As the consciousness of\
what had just happened filled\
1:12\
my mind, I [had] this\
very strong thought, ...\
1:16\
the Savior knew where I was,\
what had just transpired,\
1:21\
and [what] I was\
experiencing at that moment."\
1:27\
There were difficult days\
ahead for Richard Norby\
1:29\
and for his wife, Pam.\
1:31\
He was placed in\
an induced coma,\
1:34\
followed with\
surgeries, infections,\
1:37\
and great uncertainty.\
1:40\
Richard Norby lived, but his\
life would never be the same.\
1:45\
Two and a half years later,\
his wounds are still healing;\
1:50\
a brace replaces the\
missing part of his leg;\
1:53\
each step is different\
than before that moment\
1:57\
at the Brussels Airport.\
2:00\
Why would this happen to\
Richard and Pam Norby?\
2:03\
They had been true\
to their covenants,\
2:06\
served a previous mission\
in the Ivory Coast,\
2:09\
and raised a wonderful family.\
2:11\
Someone could understandably\
say, "It isn't fair!\
2:16\
It just isn't right!\
2:19\
They were giving their lives for\
the gospel of Jesus Christ; how\
2:24\
could this happen?"\
2:28\
Although the details will\
differ, the tragedies,\
2:31\
the unanticipated tests\
and trials--both physical\
2:35\
and spiritual--come to each of\
us because this is mortality.\
2:43\
As I thought of the speakers\
in just this session\
2:45\
of conference, it\
occurred to me that two\
2:49\
have had children and three have\
had grandchildren unexpectedly\
2:53\
return to their heavenly home.\
2:56\
None has been spared\
sickness and sadness,\
3:00\
and as has been spoken\
in this very week,\
3:04\
an angel on earth whom we all\
love, Sister Barbara Ballard,\
3:08\
stepped gently through the veil.\
3:12\
President Ballard, we will\
never forget your testimony\
3:15\
this morning.\
3:18\
We search for happiness.\
3:19\
We long for peace.\
3:21\
We hope for love.\
3:22\
And the Lord showers us with an\
amazing abundance of blessings.\
3:27\
But intermingled with\
the joy and happiness,\
3:31\
one thing is certain: there\
will be moments, hours, days,\
3:38\
sometimes years when your\
soul will be wounded.\
3:44\
The scriptures\
teach that we will\
3:45\
taste the bitter and the\
sweet and that there will\
3:48\
be "opposition in all things."\
3:51\
Jesus said, "[Your Father]\
maketh his sun to rise\
3:55\
on the evil and on the good,\
and sendeth rain on the just\
3:59\
and ... the unjust."\
4:02\
Wounds of the soul are not\
unique to the rich or the poor,\
4:07\
to one culture, one\
nation, or one generation.\
4:12\
They come to all and\
are part of the learning\
4:15\
we receive from this\
mortal experience.\
4:20\
My message today is\
especially to those\
4:23\
who are keeping the\
commandments of God,\
4:25\
keeping their promises to\
God, and, like the Norbys\
4:30\
and many other men,\
women, and children\
4:32\
in this worldwide\
audience, are confronted\
4:36\
with trials and challenges that\
are unexpected and painful.\
4:44\
Our wounds may come\
from a natural disaster\
4:47\
or an unfortunate accident.\
4:49\
They may come from an\
unfaithful husband or wife,\
4:52\
turning life upside down for a\
righteous spouse and children.\
4:57\
The wounds may come from\
the darkness and gloom\
5:00\
of depression, from an\
unanticipated illness,\
5:04\
from the suffering or premature\
death of someone we love,\
5:08\
the sadness from a family member\
dismissing his or her faith,\
5:13\
the loneliness when\
circumstances do not bring\
5:16\
an eternal companion, or a\
hundred other heart-wrenching,\
5:21\
painful "[sorrows] that\
the eye can't see."\
5:26\
We each understand that\
difficulties are part of life,\
5:30\
but when they come\
to us personally,\
5:32\
they can take our breath away.\
5:35\
Without being alarmed,\
we need to be ready.\
5:39\
The Apostle Peter said,\
"Think it not strange\
5:45\
concerning the fiery\
trial which is to try you,\
5:48\
as though some strange\
thing happened [to] you."\
5:54\
Along with the bright\
colors of happiness and joy,\
5:58\
the darker colored threads\
of trial and tragedy\
6:02\
are woven deeply into the\
fabric of our Father's plan.\
6:06\
These struggles,\
although difficult,\
6:09\
often become our\
greatest teachers.\
6:12\
When telling the miraculous\
story of Helaman's 2,060\
6:16\
young soldiers, we\
love this scripture:\
6:20\
"According to the\
goodness of God,\
6:22\
and to our great\
astonishment, and also\
6:24\
the joy of our whole army,\
there was not one soul of them\
6:30\
who did perish."\
6:32\
But the sentence\
continues: "And neither\
6:37\
was there one soul\
among them who\
6:39\
had not received many wounds."\
6:43\
Each of the 2,060 received\
many wounds, and each one of us\
6:50\
will be wounded in the battle\
of life, whether physically,\
6:55\
spiritually, or both.\
6:59\
Never give up.\
7:01\
However deep the\
wounds of your soul,\
7:04\
whatever their source, wherever\
or whenever they happen,\
7:09\
and for how short or\
long they persist,\
7:12\
you are not meant to\
perish spiritually.\
7:17\
You are meant to survive\
spiritually, and blossom\
7:21\
in your faith and trust in God.\
7:25\
God did not create our spirits\
to be independent of Him.\
7:29\
Our Lord and Savior,\
Jesus Christ,\
7:33\
through the incalculable\
gift of His Atonement,\
7:36\
not only saves us from\
death and offers us,\
7:40\
through repentance,\
forgiveness for our sins,\
7:43\
but He also stands ready\
to save us from the sorrows\
7:47\
and pains of our wounded souls.\
7:52\
The Savior is our\
Good Samaritan, sent\
7:55\
"to heal the brokenhearted."\
7:57\
He comes to us when\
others pass us by.\
8:01\
With compassion He places His\
healing balm on our wounds\
8:06\
and binds them up.\
8:08\
He carries us.\
8:10\
He cares for us.\
8:12\
He bids us, "Come unto me ...\
8:15\
and I shall heal [you]."\
8:20\
"And [Jesus] shall ...\
[suffer] pains and afflictions\
8:22\
and temptations\
of every kind; ...\
8:24\
that ... he [might] take\
upon him the pains and ...\
8:27\
sicknesses of his people ...\
8:30\
[taking upon Himself\
our] infirmities, [being]\
8:35\
filled with mercy."\
8:38\
Come, ye disconsolate,\
where'er ye languish;\
8:42\
Come to the mercy\
seat, fervently kneel.\
8:47\
Here bring your wounded\
hearts; here tell your anguish.\
8:52\
Earth has no sorrow\
that heav'n cannot heal.\
8:59\
At a time of enormous suffering,\
the Lord told the Prophet\
9:02\
Joseph, "All these things\
shall give thee experience,\
9:06\
and shall be for thy good."\
9:10\
How can painful wounds\
be for our good?\
9:13\
In the crucible of earthly\
trials, patiently move forward,\
9:19\
and the Savior's healing\
power will bring you light,\
9:23\
understanding, peace, and hope.\
9:28\
Pray with all your heart.\
9:30\
Strengthen your faith in\
Jesus Christ, in His reality,\
9:34\
in His grace.\
9:35\
Hold on to these words: "My\
grace is sufficient for thee:\
9:41\
for my strength is made\
perfect in weakness."\
9:47\
Remember, repentance is\
powerful spiritual medicine.\
9:51\
Keep the commandments and\
be worthy of the Comforter,\
9:55\
remembering the Savior\
promised, "I will not\
9:59\
leave you comfortless:\
I will come to you."\
10:04\
The peace of the temple\
is a soothing balm\
10:07\
to the wounded soul.\
10:08\
Return to the Lord's house\
with your wounded heart\
10:12\
and with your family names\
as frequently as possible.\
10:16\
The temple projects our\
brief moment in mortality\
10:21\
onto the wide\
screen of eternity.\
10:25\
Look backward, remembering\
that you proved your worthiness\
10:28\
in your premortal state.\
10:30\
You are a valiant child\
of God, and with His help\
10:34\
you can triumph in the\
battles of this fallen world.\
10:39\
You have done it before,\
and you can do it again.\
10:44\
Look forward.\
10:46\
Your troubles and\
sorrows are very real,\
10:49\
but they will not last forever.\
10:52\
Your dark night will pass\
because the Son did rise\
10:58\
"with healing in his wings."\
11:01\
The Norbys told\
me: "Disappointment\
11:03\
comes to visit on occasion\
but is never allowed to stay."\
11:08\
The Apostle Paul said,\
"We are troubled ...\
11:13\
yet not distressed; we are\
perplexed, but not in despair;\
11:18\
persecuted, but not forsaken;\
cast down, but not destroyed."\
11:25\
You may be exhausted,\
but don't ever give up.\
11:33\
Even with your own\
painful wounds,\
11:35\
you will instinctively reach\
out to others, trusting\
11:39\
in the Savior's promise:\
"Whosoever will lose his life\
11:43\
for my sake shall find it."\
11:46\
The wounded who nurse\
the wounds of others\
11:49\
are God's angels on earth.\
11:54\
In just a few moments we will\
listen to our beloved prophet,\
11:57\
President Russell M. Nelson, a\
man of undaunted faith in Jesus\
12:02\
Christ, a man of hope\
and peace, loved by God\
12:06\
but not spared from\
the wounds of the soul.\
12:10\
In 1995 his daughter Emily,\
while expecting a child,\
12:16\
was diagnosed with cancer.\
12:18\
There were days of\
hope and happiness\
12:22\
as her healthy\
baby was delivered.\
12:25\
But the cancer returned,\
and their beloved Emily\
12:30\
would pass from this\
life just two weeks\
12:33\
after her 37th birthday, leaving\
her loving husband and five\
12:39\
young children.\
12:41\
In general conference,\
shortly after her passing,\
12:45\
Elder Nelson confided: "My tears\
of sorrow have flowed along\
12:50\
with wishes that I could have\
done more for our daughter. ...\
12:53\
If I had the power\
of resurrection,\
12:57\
I would have been tempted\
to bring [her] back. ...\
13:00\
[But] Jesus Christ holds\
those keys and will use them\
13:04\
for Emily ... and for all\
people in the Lord's own time."\
13:11\
Last month, while visiting\
the Saints in Puerto Rico,\
13:15\
and remembering last year's\
devastating hurricane,\
13:18\
President Nelson spoke\
with love and compassion:\
13:24\
"[This] is part of life.\
13:25\
It's why we're here.\
13:27\
We are here to have a body\
and to be tried and tested.\
13:31\
Some of those tests are\
physical; some are spiritual,\
13:36\
and your trials here have been\
both physical and spiritual."\
13:41\
"You have not given up.\
13:43\
We are [so] proud of you.\
13:45\
You faithful Saints have lost\
much, but through it all,\
13:50\
you have fostered your faith\
in the Lord Jesus Christ."\
13:54\
"By keeping God's\
commandments, we\
13:58\
can find joy even in the midst\
of our worst circumstances."\
14:05\
My brothers and sisters,\
it is my promise to you\
14:10\
that increasing your faith\
in the Lord Jesus Christ\
14:13\
will bring you added\
strength and greater hope.\
14:17\
For you, the righteous,\
the Healer of our souls,\
14:21\
in His time and His way,\
will heal all your wounds.\
14:26\
No injustice, no persecution,\
no trial, no sadness,\
14:31\
no heartache, no suffering,\
no wound--however deep,\
14:39\
however wide, however\
painful--will be excluded from\
14:44\
the comfort, peace, and lasting\
hope of Him whose open arms\
14:51\
and whose wounded hands will\
welcome us back into His\
14:55\
presence.\
14:56\
At that day, the\
Apostle John testifies,\
15:00\
the righteous "which [come]\
out of great tribulation"\
15:03\
will stand "arrayed\
in white robes ...\
15:05\
before the throne of God."\
15:07\
The Lamb will "dwell\
among [us] ...\
15:11\
and God shall wipe away all\
tears from [your] eyes."\
15:17\
This day will come.\
15:19\
I so witness in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
