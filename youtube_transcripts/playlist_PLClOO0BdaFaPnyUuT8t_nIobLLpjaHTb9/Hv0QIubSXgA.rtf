When I was in\
elementary school, we\
0:04\
walked home on a paved trail\
that wound back and forth\
0:07\
up the side of a hill.\
0:09\
There was another\
trail, unpaved,\
0:11\
called the "boys' trail."\
0:14\
The boys' trail was a path in\
the dirt that went straight\
0:18\
up the hill.\
0:19\
It was shorter but much steeper.\
0:22\
As a young girl, I\
knew I could walk up\
0:25\
any trail the boys could.\
0:27\
More important, I knew I was\
living in the latter days\
0:31\
and that I would need\
to do hard things,\
0:33\
as did the pioneers--and\
I wanted to be prepared.\
0:38\
So every now and then I would\
lag behind my group of friends\
0:42\
on the paved trail,\
remove my shoes, and walk\
0:46\
barefoot up the boys' trail.\
0:48\
I was trying to\
toughen up my feet.\
0:53\
As a young Primary\
girl, that is what I\
0:56\
thought I could do to prepare.\
0:58\
Now I know differently!\
1:00\
Rather than walking\
barefoot up mountain trails,\
1:04\
I know I can prepare my feet\
to walk on the covenant path\
1:08\
by responding to the\
invitations of the Holy Ghost.\
1:12\
For the Lord, through His\
prophet, is calling each of us\
1:16\
to live and care in a\
"higher and holier way"\
1:20\
and to "take a step higher."\
1:24\
These prophetic calls to action,\
coupled with our innate sense\
1:27\
that we can do and be more,\
sometimes create within us\
1:33\
what Elder Neal A. Maxwell\
called "divine discontent."\
1:37\
Divine discontent comes\
when we compare "what we are\
1:43\
[to] what we have\
the power to become."\
1:46\
Each of us, if we are\
honest, feels a gap\
1:49\
between where and\
who we are and where\
1:52\
and who we want to become.\
1:54\
We yearn for greater\
personal capacity.\
1:57\
We have these\
feelings because we\
2:00\
are daughters and sons of God,\
born with the Light of Christ\
2:03\
yet living in a fallen world.\
2:06\
These feelings are God-given\
and create an urgency to act.\
2:11\
We should welcome feelings\
of divine discontent\
2:14\
that call us to a higher way,\
while recognizing and avoiding\
2:19\
Satan's counterfeit:\
paralyzing discouragement.\
2:23\
This is a precious\
space into which\
2:25\
Satan is all too eager to jump.\
2:28\
We can choose to walk\
the higher path that\
2:32\
leads us to seek for God\
and His peace and grace,\
2:35\
or we can listen to Satan,\
who bombards us with messages\
2:40\
that we will never be enough:\
rich enough, smart enough,\
2:44\
beautiful enough,\
anything enough.\
2:46\
Our discontent can become\
divine--or destructive.\
2:52\
One way to tell\
divine discontent\
2:55\
from Satan's counterfeit is that\
divine discontent will lead us\
2:59\
to faithful action.\
3:01\
Divine discontent\
is not an invitation\
3:04\
to stay in our comfort zone,\
nor will it lead us to despair.\
3:08\
I have learned\
that when I wallow\
3:11\
in thoughts of everything I\
am not, I do not progress,\
3:15\
and I find it much\
more difficult\
3:17\
to feel and follow the Spirit.\
3:21\
As a young man,\
Joseph Smith became\
3:23\
keenly aware of his shortcomings\
and worried about "the welfare\
3:26\
of [his] immortal soul."\
3:28\
In his words, "My mind became\
exceedingly distressed,\
3:33\
for I became convicted\
of my sins, and ...\
3:36\
felt to mourn for my own sins\
and for the sins of the world."\
3:40\
This led him to\
"serious reflection\
3:43\
and great uneasiness."\
3:46\
Does this sound familiar?\
3:48\
Are you uneasy or distressed\
by your shortcomings?\
3:52\
Well, Joseph did something.\
3:55\
He shared, "I often said to\
myself: What is to be done?"\
4:00\
Joseph acted in faith.\
4:03\
He turned to the scriptures,\
read the invitation\
4:06\
in James 1:5, and\
turned to God for help.\
4:10\
The resulting vision\
ushered in the Restoration.\
4:13\
How grateful I am that\
Joseph's divine discontent,\
4:18\
his period of unease\
and confusion,\
4:20\
spurred him to faithful action.\
4:23\
The world often uses a\
feeling of discontent\
4:26\
as an excuse for\
self-absorption,\
4:28\
for turning our thoughts\
inward and backward\
4:31\
and dwelling individually\
on who I am, who I am not,\
4:36\
and what I want.\
4:38\
Divine discontent\
motivates us to follow\
4:41\
the example of the Savior,\
who "went about doing good."\
4:46\
As we walk the path\
of discipleship,\
4:49\
we will receive spiritual\
nudges to reach out to others.\
4:53\
A story I heard\
years ago has helped\
4:56\
me recognize and then act on\
promptings from the Holy Ghost.\
5:00\
Sister Bonnie Parkin, former\
Relief Society General\
5:03\
President, shared the following:\
5:06\
"Susan ... was a\
wonderful seamstress.\
5:09\
President Kimball\
lived in [her] ward.\
5:11\
One Sunday, Susan noticed\
that he had a new suit.\
5:15\
Her father had recently ...\
brought her some exquisite silk\
5:18\
fabric.\
5:19\
Susan thought that fabric\
would make a handsome tie\
5:23\
to go with President\
Kimball's new suit.\
5:25\
So on Monday she made the tie.\
5:27\
She wrapped it in tissue\
paper and walked up the block\
5:30\
to President Kimball's home.\
5:33\
"On her way to the\
front door, she suddenly\
5:35\
stopped and thought, 'Who am I\
to make a tie for the prophet?\
5:40\
He probably has plenty of them.'\
5:42\
Deciding she had made a\
mistake, she turned to leave.\
5:47\
"Just then Sister Kimball\
opened the front door and said,\
5:50\
'Oh, Susan!'\
5:52\
"Stumbling all over\
herself, Susan said,\
5:54\
'I saw President Kimball\
in his new suit on Sunday.\
5:57\
Dad just brought me some\
silk from New York ...\
5:59\
and so I made him a tie.'\
6:03\
"Before Susan could continue,\
Sister Kimball stopped her,\
6:06\
took hold of her\
shoulders, and said:\
6:09\
'Susan, never suppress\
a generous thought.'"\
6:14\
I love that!\
6:15\
"Never suppress a\
generous thought."\
6:18\
Sometimes when I\
have an impression\
6:21\
to do something for\
someone, I wonder\
6:23\
if it was a prompting\
or just my own thoughts.\
6:26\
But I am reminded\
that "that which\
6:29\
is of God inviteth and enticeth\
to do good continually;\
6:34\
wherefore, every\
thing which inviteth\
6:37\
and enticeth to do good, and\
to love God, and to serve him,\
6:41\
is inspired of God."\
6:45\
Whether they are direct\
promptings or just impulses\
6:48\
to help, a good deed\
is never wasted,\
6:51\
for "charity never faileth"--and\
is never the wrong response.\
6:57\
Often the timing\
is inconvenient,\
6:59\
and we seldom know the impact\
of our small acts of service.\
7:03\
But every now and\
then we will recognize\
7:06\
that we have been instruments\
in the hands of God,\
7:09\
and we will be grateful to know\
that the Holy Ghost working\
7:13\
through us is a manifestation\
of God's approval.\
7:17\
Sisters, you and I can\
plead for the Holy Ghost\
7:21\
to show us "all things\
what [we] should do,"\
7:23\
even when our to-do\
list already looks full.\
7:26\
When prompted, we\
can leave dishes\
7:29\
in the sink or an inbox full of\
challenges demanding attention\
7:33\
in order to read to a\
child, visit with a friend,\
7:37\
babysit a neighbor's children,\
or serve in the temple.\
7:41\
Don't get me wrong--I\
am a list maker;\
7:44\
I love checking things off.\
7:46\
But peace comes in\
knowing that being more\
7:50\
does not necessarily\
equate to doing more.\
7:54\
Responding to\
discontent by resolving\
7:57\
to follow promptings changes\
the way I think about "my time,"\
8:02\
and I see people not\
as interruptions but as\
8:06\
the purpose of my life.\
8:09\
Divine discontent\
leads to humility, not\
8:13\
to self-pity or the\
discouragement that\
8:15\
comes from making comparisons in\
which we always come up short.\
8:20\
Covenant-keeping women come\
in all sizes and shapes;\
8:24\
their families and life\
experiences and circumstances\
8:28\
vary.\
8:30\
Of course, all of us will fall\
short of our divine potential,\
8:34\
and there is some truth\
in the realization\
8:37\
that alone we are not enough.\
8:40\
But the good news of the gospel\
is that with the grace of God,\
8:45\
we are enough.\
8:46\
With Christ's help\
we can do all things.\
8:50\
The scriptures promise\
that we will "find grace\
8:53\
to help in time of need."\
8:56\
The surprising truth\
is that our weaknesses\
8:59\
can be a blessing\
when they humble us\
9:01\
and turn us to Christ.\
9:03\
Discontent becomes\
divine when we humbly\
9:07\
approach Jesus\
Christ with our want\
9:09\
rather than hold\
back in self-pity.\
9:12\
In fact, Jesus's\
miracles often began\
9:15\
with a recognition of want,\
need, failure, or inadequacy.\
9:20\
Remember the loaves and fishes?\
9:23\
Each of the Gospel writers\
tells how Jesus miraculously fed\
9:27\
the thousands who followed Him.\
9:29\
But the story begins with\
the disciples' recognition\
9:33\
of their lack; they realize\
they have only "five\
9:37\
barley loaves, and\
two small fishes:\
9:39\
but what are they\
among so many?"\
9:42\
The disciples were right:\
they didn't have enough food.\
9:47\
But they gave what\
they had to Jesus,\
9:50\
and then He provided\
the miracle.\
9:53\
Have you ever felt your\
gifts and talents were\
9:56\
too small for the task ahead?\
9:58\
I have.\
10:00\
But you and I can give\
what we have to Christ,\
10:03\
and He will multiply\
our efforts.\
10:05\
What you have to offer is\
more than enough--even with\
10:09\
your human frailties and\
weaknesses--if you rely\
10:12\
on the grace of God.\
10:15\
The truth is that each one\
of us is one generation away\
10:18\
from Deity, a child of God.\
10:21\
And just as He has done with\
both prophets and ordinary men\
10:25\
and women through the\
ages, so Heavenly Father\
10:28\
intends to transform us.\
10:31\
C. S. Lewis explained God's\
transforming power this way:\
10:35\
"Imagine yourself\
as a living house.\
10:39\
God comes in to\
rebuild that house.\
10:42\
At first, perhaps, you can\
understand what He is doing.\
10:45\
He is getting the drains\
right and stopping\
10:47\
the leaks in the\
roof and so on; you\
10:50\
knew that those\
[things] needed doing\
10:52\
and so you are not surprised.\
10:54\
But presently He starts knocking\
the house about in a way that\
10:58\
hurts abominably.\
10:59\
...\
10:59\
[You see,] He is building quite\
a different house from the one\
11:04\
you thought of. ...\
11:05\
You thought you were being made\
into a decent little cottage:\
11:09\
but He is building a palace.\
11:11\
He intends to come and\
live in it Himself."\
11:17\
Because of our Savior's\
atoning sacrifice,\
11:20\
we can be made equal to\
the tasks that lie ahead.\
11:24\
The prophets have\
taught that as we\
11:27\
climb the path of\
discipleship, we\
11:29\
can be sanctified through\
the grace of Christ.\
11:33\
Divine discontent can\
move us to act in faith,\
11:37\
follow the Savior's\
invitations to do good,\
11:40\
and give our lives\
humbly to Him.\
11:43\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
