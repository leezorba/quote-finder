My fellow brothers\
and sisters, recently,\
0:05\
as I was pondering\
President Nelson's charge\
0:07\
to call the Church\
by its revealed name,\
0:10\
I turned to where the Savior\
instructed the Nephites\
0:13\
about the name of the Church.\
0:15\
As I read the\
Savior's words, I was\
0:17\
struck by how He also told\
the people that "ye must take\
0:22\
upon you the name of Christ."\
0:24\
This caused me to look\
at myself and ask, "Am I\
0:27\
taking upon myself\
the Savior's name\
0:29\
as He would have me do so?"\
0:32\
Today I would like to share\
some of the impressions\
0:35\
I have received in\
answer to my question.\
0:39\
First, to take upon\
ourselves the name of Christ\
0:42\
means we faithfully\
strive to see as God sees.\
0:46\
How does God see?\
0:48\
Joseph Smith said, "While\
one portion of the human race\
0:52\
is judging and condemning\
the other without mercy,\
0:56\
the Great Parent of\
the universe looks\
0:58\
upon the whole of\
the human family\
1:01\
with a fatherly care\
and a paternal regard,"\
1:05\
for "His love [is]\
unfathomable."\
1:09\
A few years ago my older\
sister passed away.\
1:13\
She had had a challenging life.\
1:15\
She struggled with the gospel\
and was never really active.\
1:18\
Her husband abandoned\
their marriage\
1:20\
and left her with four\
young children to raise.\
1:24\
On the evening of her\
passing, in a room\
1:27\
with her children present,\
I gave her a blessing\
1:30\
to peacefully return home.\
1:32\
At that moment I\
realized I had too often\
1:35\
defined my sister's\
life in terms\
1:37\
of her trials and inactivity.\
1:40\
As I placed my hands on\
her head that evening,\
1:43\
I received a severe\
rebuke from the Spirit.\
1:46\
I was made acutely aware of her\
goodness and allowed to see her\
1:51\
as God saw her--not as someone\
who struggled with the gospel\
1:55\
and life, but as someone who had\
to deal with difficult issues I\
1:59\
did not have.\
2:00\
I saw her as a\
magnificent mother\
2:03\
who, despite great\
obstacles, had raised four\
2:06\
beautiful, amazing children.\
2:08\
I saw her as the\
friend to our mother\
2:11\
who took time to watch over\
and be a companion to her\
2:15\
after our father passed away.\
2:18\
During that final\
evening with my sister,\
2:21\
I believe God was\
asking me, "Can't you\
2:24\
see that everyone around\
you is a sacred being?"\
2:28\
Brigham Young taught:\
2:29\
"I wish to urge\
upon the Saints ...\
2:31\
to understand men and\
women as they are,\
2:34\
and not understand\
them as you are."\
2:37\
"How often it is said--'Such\
a person has done wrong,\
2:40\
and he cannot be a Saint.'\
2:41\
...\
2:42\
We hear some swear and lie\
... [or] break the Sabbath.\
2:45\
...\
2:45\
Do not judge such persons,\
for you do not know the design\
2:49\
of the Lord concerning them. ...\
2:51\
[Rather,] bear with them."\
2:53\
Can any one of you\
imagine our Savior\
2:56\
letting you and your\
burdens go unnoticed by Him?\
2:59\
The Savior looked upon the\
Samaritan, the adulterer,\
3:03\
the tax collector, the\
leper, the mentally ill,\
3:06\
and the sinner\
with the same eyes.\
3:08\
All were children of His\
Father; all were redeemable.\
3:12\
Can you imagine Him\
turning away from someone\
3:14\
with doubts about their\
place in God's kingdom\
3:17\
or from anyone\
afflicted in any manner?\
3:20\
I cannot.\
3:21\
In the eyes of Christ, each\
soul is of infinite worth.\
3:25\
No one is preordained to fail.\
3:27\
Eternal life is\
possible for all.\
3:31\
From the Spirit's rebuke\
at my sister's bedside,\
3:34\
I learned a great lesson:\
that as we see as He sees,\
3:39\
ours will be a double\
victory--redemption of those we\
3:42\
touch and redemption\
of ourselves.\
3:46\
Second, to take upon\
ourselves the name of Christ,\
3:49\
we must not only see as God\
sees, but we must do His work\
3:52\
and serve as He served.\
3:54\
We live the two\
great commandments,\
3:56\
submit to God's will,\
gather Israel, and let\
3:59\
our light "shine before men."\
4:01\
We receive and live the\
covenants and ordinances\
4:05\
of His restored Church.\
4:07\
As we do this, God\
endows us with power\
4:09\
to bless ourselves,\
our families,\
4:12\
and the lives of others.\
4:14\
Ask yourself, "Do\
I know anyone who\
4:18\
does not need the powers\
of heaven in their lives?"\
4:21\
God will work wonders among\
us as we sanctify ourselves.\
4:25\
We sanctify ourselves\
by purifying our hearts.\
4:28\
We purify our hearts as we\
hear Him, repent of our sins,\
4:33\
become converted,\
and love as He loves.\
4:36\
The Savior asked us, "For if\
ye love them which love you,\
4:41\
what reward have ye?"\
4:44\
I recently learned\
about an experience\
4:45\
in the life of Elder James E.\
Talmage that caused me to pause\
4:48\
and consider how I love\
and serve those around me.\
4:52\
As a young professor,\
before he ever\
4:54\
became an Apostle and in the\
height of the deadly diphtheria\
4:57\
epidemic of 1892, Elder\
Talmage discovered a family\
5:01\
of strangers, not members of\
the Church, who lived near him\
5:05\
that were stricken\
by the disease.\
5:07\
No one wanted to put\
themselves at risk\
5:10\
by going inside\
the infected home.\
5:12\
Elder Talmage, however,\
immediately proceeded\
5:15\
to the home.\
5:15\
He found four children:\
a 2-and-1/2-year-old dead\
5:19\
on the floor, a 5-year-old\
and 10-year-old in great pain,\
5:23\
and a weakened 13-year-old.\
5:25\
The parents were suffering\
with grief and fatigue.\
5:28\
Elder Talmage dressed\
the dead and the living,\
5:31\
swept the rooms, carried\
out the soiled clothing,\
5:34\
and burned filthy rags\
covered with the disease.\
5:37\
He worked all day and then\
returned the next morning.\
5:41\
The 10-year-old died\
during the night.\
5:44\
He lifted and held\
the 5-year-old.\
5:47\
She coughed bloody mucus all\
over his face and clothes.\
5:50\
He wrote, "I could\
not put her from me,"\
5:53\
and he held her until\
she died in his arms.\
5:56\
He helped bury\
all three children\
5:59\
and arranged for food\
and clean clothing\
6:01\
for the grieving family.\
6:02\
Upon returning home,\
Brother Talmage disposed\
6:06\
of his clothes, bathed\
in a zinc solution,\
6:09\
quarantined himself\
from his family,\
6:11\
and suffered through a\
mild attack of the disease.\
6:16\
So many lives around\
us are at stake.\
6:20\
Saints take the Savior's name\
upon themselves by becoming\
6:24\
holy and ministering to all,\
regardless of where or how they\
6:28\
stand--lives are\
saved as we do so.\
6:33\
Finally, I believe that to\
take upon ourselves His name,\
6:36\
we must trust Him.\
6:38\
At a meeting I attended one\
Sunday, a young woman asked\
6:41\
something like the\
following: "My boyfriend\
6:44\
and I recently broke up, and\
he chose to leave the Church.\
6:47\
He tells me he has\
never been happier.\
6:50\
How can this be?"\
6:52\
The Savior answered\
this question when\
6:54\
He said to the Nephites,\
"But if [your life is]\
6:57\
not built upon my gospel, and\
is built upon the works of men,\
7:01\
or upon the works of\
the devil, verily I\
7:04\
say unto you [you will] have joy\
in [your] works for a season,\
7:08\
and by and by the end cometh."\
7:11\
There simply is no enduring\
joy outside the gospel\
7:15\
of Jesus Christ.\
7:18\
At that meeting,\
however, I thought\
7:20\
about the many\
good people I know\
7:22\
who struggle with great\
burdens and commandments that\
7:24\
are daunting at best for them.\
7:27\
I asked myself, "What else\
might the Savior say to them?"\
7:30\
I believe He would\
ask, "Do you trust me?"\
7:35\
To the woman with the\
issue of blood, He said,\
7:38\
"Thy faith hath made\
thee whole; go in peace."\
7:42\
One of my favorite scriptures\
is John 4:4, which reads,\
7:45\
"And he must needs\
go through Samaria."\
7:49\
Why do I love that scripture?\
7:50\
Because Jesus did not\
need to go to Samaria.\
7:53\
The Jews of His day\
despised the Samaritans\
7:56\
and traveled a road\
around Samaria.\
7:59\
But Jesus chose to\
go there to declare\
8:01\
before all people\
for the first time\
8:04\
that He was the\
promised Messiah.\
8:06\
For this message He not\
only chose an outcast group,\
8:11\
but also a woman--and not just\
any woman but a woman living\
8:15\
in sin--someone considered\
at that time to be the least\
8:19\
of the least.\
8:20\
I believe Jesus did\
this so that each of us\
8:24\
may always understand that His\
love is greater than our fears,\
8:28\
our wounds, our addictions,\
our doubts, our temptations,\
8:33\
our sins, our broken families,\
our depression and anxieties,\
8:38\
our chronic illness,\
our poverty, our abuse,\
8:42\
our despair, and our loneliness.\
8:45\
He wants all to know\
there is nothing\
8:48\
and no one He is unable to heal\
and deliver to enduring joy.\
8:54\
His grace is sufficient.\
8:55\
He alone descended\
below all things.\
8:58\
The power of His\
Atonement is the power\
9:00\
to overcome any\
burden in our life.\
9:03\
The message of the\
woman at the well\
9:05\
is that He knows\
our life situations\
9:08\
and that we can always walk with\
Him no matter where we stand.\
9:11\
To her and to each of us He\
says, "Whosoever drinketh\
9:16\
of the water that I shall\
give him shall never thirst;\
9:19\
but [shall have] a well\
of water springing up\
9:21\
into everlasting life."\
9:24\
In any of life's travels,\
why would you ever turn away\
9:28\
from the only Savior who has all\
power to heal and deliver you?\
9:33\
Whatever the price you must pay\
to trust Him, it's worth it.\
9:37\
My brothers and\
sisters, let us choose\
9:40\
to increase our faith in\
Heavenly Father and our Savior,\
9:43\
Jesus Christ.\
9:45\
From the very\
depths of my soul, I\
9:47\
bear testimony that The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
9:49\
Saints is the Savior's\
Church, directed by the living\
9:53\
Christ through a true prophet.\
9:55\
My prayer is that we will\
faithfully take upon ourselves\
9:59\
the name of Jesus Christ--by\
seeing as He sees,\
10:02\
by serving as He served, and\
by trusting that His grace is\
10:06\
sufficient to deliver us\
home and to enduring joy.\
10:10\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
