My dear brothers and sisters,\
it's such a wonderful occasion\
0:05\
to be with you in this marvelous\
general conference session\
0:10\
today to listen to\
inspired messages,\
0:13\
to listen to this marvelous,\
amazing choir of missionaries\
0:19\
representing the many thousands\
of missionaries all around\
0:23\
the world--our daughters, our\
sons--and especially of being\
0:28\
united in our faith today, again\
sustaining our dear President\
0:34\
and prophet, President\
Russell M. Nelson;\
0:36\
the First Presidency; and the\
General Officers of the Church.\
0:40\
What a joyful day to\
be with you today!\
0:44\
Now, the ancient\
King Solomon was\
0:49\
one of the most outwardly\
successful human beings\
0:53\
in history.\
0:54\
He seemed to have everything:\
money, power, adoration, honor.\
1:02\
But after decades of\
self-indulgence and luxury,\
1:06\
how did King Solomon\
sum up his life?\
1:11\
"All is vanity," he said.\
1:15\
This man, who had it all, ended\
up disillusioned, pessimistic,\
1:21\
and unhappy despite everything\
he had going for him.\
1:28\
There's a word in\
German, Weltschmerz.\
1:32\
Loosely defined, it\
means the sadness\
1:34\
that comes from\
brooding about how\
1:37\
the world is inferior to\
how we think it ought to be.\
1:43\
Perhaps there's a little\
Weltschmerz in all of us.\
1:49\
When silent sorrows creep\
into the corners of our lives;\
1:53\
when sadness saturates our days\
and casts deep shadows over\
1:58\
our nights; when tragedy and\
injustice enter the world\
2:04\
around us, including the\
lives of those we love;\
2:08\
when we journey through our\
own personal and lonely path\
2:13\
of misfortune, and pain darkens\
our stillness and breaches\
2:18\
our tranquility--we might be\
tempted to agree with Solomon\
2:25\
that life is vain and\
devoid of meaning.\
2:30\
The good news is, there is hope.\
2:34\
There is a solution to\
the emptiness, vanity,\
2:38\
and Weltschmerz of life.\
2:40\
There is a solution\
to even the deepest\
2:43\
hopelessness and\
discouragement you might feel.\
2:47\
This hope is found in\
the transformative power\
2:52\
of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ and in the Savior's\
2:57\
redemptive power to heal\
us from our soul-sickness.\
3:03\
"I am come," Jesus declared,\
"that they might have life,\
3:08\
and that they might have\
it more abundantly."\
3:15\
We achieve that abundant life\
not by focusing on our own\
3:19\
needs or on our own achievements\
but by becoming true disciples\
3:27\
of Jesus Christ--by following\
in His ways and engaging in His\
3:33\
work.\
3:34\
We find the abundant life\
by forgetting ourselves\
3:39\
and engaging in the\
great cause of Christ.\
3:44\
Now, what is the\
cause of Christ?\
3:47\
It is to believe in Him, love\
as He loved, and do as He did.\
3:56\
Jesus "went about doing good."\
3:59\
He walked among the poor,\
the outcast, the sick,\
4:03\
and the ashamed.\
4:05\
He ministered to the powerless,\
the weak, and the friendless.\
4:11\
He spent time with them;\
He spoke with them.\
4:15\
"And he healed them."\
4:20\
Everywhere He went, the\
Savior taught the "good news"\
4:26\
of the gospel.\
4:27\
He shared eternal truths that\
set people free spiritually\
4:33\
as well as temporally.\
4:37\
Those who dedicate\
themselves to Christ's cause\
4:40\
discover the truth of\
the Savior's promise:\
4:44\
"Whosoever will lose his life\
for my sake shall find it."\
4:51\
Solomon was wrong, my dear\
brothers and sisters--life is\
4:57\
not "vanity."\
4:59\
To the contrary, it can be full\
of purpose, meaning, and peace.\
5:06\
The healing hands\
of Jesus Christ\
5:09\
reach out to all who seek Him.\
5:13\
I have come to know\
without a doubt\
5:17\
that believing and loving God\
and striving to follow Christ\
5:21\
can change our hearts,\
soften our pain,\
5:26\
and fill our souls with\
"exceedingly great joy."\
5:31\
Of course, we must\
do more than merely\
5:35\
have an intellectual\
understanding\
5:37\
of the gospel for it\
to have this healing\
5:42\
influence in our lives.\
5:44\
We must incorporate it into our\
lives--make it a part of who we\
5:50\
are and what we do.\
5:54\
May I suggest that discipleship\
begins with three simple words:\
6:02\
Believe, love, and do.\
6:09\
Believing God leads\
to faith in Him\
6:12\
and developing\
trust in His word.\
6:16\
Faith causes our hearts to grow\
in our love for God and others.\
6:22\
And as that love\
grows, we are inspired\
6:28\
to emulate the Savior as we\
continue our own great journey\
6:32\
on the path of discipleship.\
6:36\
"But," you will say, "that\
seems a bit simplistic.\
6:40\
Life's problems,\
certainly my problems,\
6:44\
are far too complex for\
such a simple prescription.\
6:48\
You can't cure Weltschmerz\
with three simple words:\
6:54\
believe, love, do."\
6:58\
No, it's not the\
aphorism that cures.\
7:03\
It is the love of God that\
rescues, restores, and revives.\
7:10\
God knows you.\
7:11\
You are His child.\
7:13\
He loves you.\
7:15\
Even when you think that\
you are not lovable,\
7:19\
He reaches out to you.\
7:22\
This very day--every\
day--He reaches out to you,\
7:27\
desiring to heal\
you, lift you up,\
7:31\
and to replace the emptiness in\
your heart with an abiding joy.\
7:38\
He desires to sweep away any\
darkness that clouds your life\
7:44\
and fill it with the\
sacred and brilliant light\
7:47\
of His unending glory.\
7:51\
I have experienced\
this for myself.\
7:55\
And it is my witness as an\
Apostle of the Lord Jesus\
7:58\
Christ that all who come unto\
God--all who truly believe,\
8:05\
love, and do--can\
experience the same.\
8:12\
The scriptures teach us\
that "without faith it\
8:16\
is impossible to please [God]:\
for he that cometh to God\
8:20\
must believe that he is."\
8:23\
For some, the act of believing\
is difficult. Sometimes\
8:29\
our pride gets in the way.\
8:32\
Perhaps we think that because\
we are intelligent, educated,\
8:36\
or experienced, we simply\
cannot believe in God.\
8:41\
And we begin to look at\
religion as foolish tradition.\
8:48\
In my experience, belief is\
not so much like a painting\
8:52\
we look at and admire and about\
which we discuss and theorize.\
8:58\
No, it is more like a plough\
that we take into the fields\
9:03\
and, by the sweat of\
our brow, create furrows\
9:08\
in the earth that\
accept seeds and bear\
9:11\
fruit that shall remain.\
9:15\
Draw near to God, and He\
will draw near to you.\
9:20\
This is the promise to\
all who seek to believe.\
9:27\
The scriptures\
reveal that the more\
9:29\
we love God and His children,\
the happier we become.\
9:35\
The love Jesus spoke about,\
however, isn't a gift-card,\
9:40\
throwaway,\
move-on-to-other-things love.\
9:43\
It isn't a love that is\
spoken of and then forgotten.\
9:48\
It is not a "let me know if\
there is anything I can do"\
9:52\
sort of love.\
9:56\
The love God speaks\
of is the kind\
10:00\
that enters our hearts when\
we awake in the morning,\
10:04\
stays with us throughout the\
day, and swells in our hearts\
10:09\
as we give voice to our prayers\
of gratitude at evening's end.\
10:16\
This is the inexpressible love\
Heavenly Father has for us.\
10:23\
It is this endless\
compassion that\
10:27\
allows us to more clearly\
see others for who they are.\
10:31\
Through the lens\
of pure love, we\
10:35\
see immortal beings of\
infinite potential and worth\
10:40\
and beloved sons and\
daughters of Almighty God.\
10:46\
Once we see through that lens,\
we cannot discount, disregard,\
10:55\
or discriminate against anyone.\
11:01\
In the Savior's\
work, it is often\
11:03\
"by small and simple" means\
that "great things [are]\
11:07\
brought to pass."\
11:10\
We know that it requires\
repetitive practice\
11:14\
to become good at anything.\
11:18\
Whether it's playing\
the clarinet,\
11:20\
kicking a ball into a\
net, repairing a car,\
11:24\
or even flying an\
airplane, it is\
11:29\
through practicing that we\
may become better and better.\
11:35\
The organization our Savior\
created on earth--The Church\
11:38\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints--helps us to do just\
11:44\
that.\
11:45\
It offers a place to practice\
living the way He taught\
11:52\
and blessing others\
the way He did.\
11:57\
As Church members, we are given\
callings, responsibilities,\
12:01\
and opportunities to reach\
out in compassion and minister\
12:06\
to others.\
12:08\
Recently the Church has\
placed a renewed emphasis\
12:12\
on ministering, or\
serving or loving others.\
12:17\
And this is truly a\
wonderful way to minister,\
12:24\
a way to all of those around us.\
12:27\
It is a more refined way to\
love and serve our fellow beings\
12:35\
by ministering to\
them in many ways.\
12:38\
Great thought was taken to\
determine what we should\
12:44\
call this special emphasis.\
12:46\
One of the names\
considered was shepherding,\
12:53\
a fitting reference to Christ's\
invitation: "Feed my sheep."\
12:57\
However, it had at\
least one complication:\
13:02\
using that term would\
make me a German shepherd.\
13:18\
Consequently, I am quite content\
with the term ministering.\
13:27\
Of course, this\
emphasis is not new.\
13:30\
It simply provides a renewed\
and refined opportunity for us\
13:34\
to practice the\
Savior's commandments\
13:37\
to "love one another,"\
a refined way\
13:40\
to implement and practice\
the purpose of the Church.\
13:45\
Just think about that.\
13:47\
Missionary work--the\
courageous, humble,\
13:51\
and confident sharing of the\
gospel--is a wonderful example\
13:55\
of ministering to the\
spiritual needs of others,\
14:00\
whoever they are.\
14:03\
Or doing temple work--seeking\
out the names of our ancestors\
14:07\
and offering them the\
blessings of eternity.\
14:11\
What a divine way\
of ministering.\
14:15\
Consider the act of seeking\
out the poor and the needy,\
14:18\
lifting the hands\
that hang down,\
14:21\
or blessing the\
sick and afflicted.\
14:24\
Aren't these the very\
acts of pure ministering\
14:28\
the Lord practiced when\
He walked the earth?\
14:35\
If you are not a\
member of the Church,\
14:37\
I invite you to come and see.\
14:43\
Come and join with us.\
14:47\
If you are a member\
of the Church\
14:49\
but presently not\
participating actively,\
14:54\
I invite you, please come back.\
14:58\
We need you!\
15:00\
Come, add your\
strengths to ours.\
15:04\
Because of your unique talents,\
abilities, and personality,\
15:09\
you will help us become\
better and happier.\
15:13\
In return, we will help you\
become better and happier\
15:18\
as well.\
15:19\
Come, help us build\
and strengthen\
15:22\
a culture of healing,\
kindness, and mercy\
15:26\
towards all of God's children.\
15:29\
For we are all striving to\
become new creatures where "old\
15:34\
things are passed away" and\
"all things ... become new."\
15:39\
God shows us the direction\
to move--forward and upward.\
15:44\
He says, "If ye love me,\
keep my commandments."\
15:50\
Let us all work together to\
become the people God intended\
15:55\
for us to become.\
15:58\
This is the kind\
of gospel culture\
16:00\
we desire to cultivate\
throughout the Church of Jesus\
16:03\
Christ.\
16:05\
We seek to strengthen\
the Church as a place\
16:09\
where we forgive\
one another; where\
16:12\
we resist the temptation\
to find fault, gossip,\
16:17\
and bring others down; where,\
instead of pointing out flaws,\
16:23\
we lift up and help each other\
to become the best we can be.\
16:30\
Let me invite you again.\
16:32\
Come and see.\
16:34\
Join with us.\
16:35\
We need you.\
16:38\
You will find that\
this Church is\
16:40\
filled with some of the finest\
people this world has to offer.\
16:43\
They are welcoming,\
loving, kind, and sincere.\
16:47\
They are sacrificing,\
hardworking, and even heroic\
16:52\
at times.\
16:54\
And they are also\
painfully imperfect.\
17:01\
They make mistakes.\
17:03\
From time to time they\
say things they shouldn't.\
17:06\
They do things they\
wish they hadn't.\
17:10\
But they do have this in\
common--they want to improve\
17:14\
and draw closer to the Lord,\
our Savior, even Jesus Christ.\
17:20\
They are trying to get it right.\
17:24\
They believe.\
17:25\
They love.\
17:26\
They do.\
17:30\
They want to become less\
selfish, more compassionate,\
17:33\
more refined, more like Jesus.\
17:38\
Yes, life can be hard at times.\
17:42\
Certainly we all have our times\
of despair and discouragement.\
17:50\
But the gospel of Jesus\
Christ offers hope.\
17:53\
And in the Church\
of Jesus Christ,\
17:55\
we join with others who seek\
a place where we can feel\
17:59\
at home--a place of\
growth where, together,\
18:04\
we can believe, love, and do.\
18:08\
Regardless of our\
differences, we\
18:12\
seek to embrace one another\
as sons and daughters\
18:17\
of our beloved Heavenly Father.\
18:20\
I am grateful\
beyond measure to be\
18:23\
a member of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
18:27\
and to know that God loves His\
children enough to give them\
18:31\
a blueprint for\
happiness and meaning\
18:34\
in this life and a\
way to experience\
18:38\
eternal joy in the halls of\
glory in the life to come.\
18:43\
I am grateful that\
God has given us\
18:45\
a way to heal the\
soul-sicknesses\
18:49\
and the Weltschmerz of life.\
18:53\
I testify and leave\
you my blessing\
18:57\
that as we believe in God,\
as we love Him and love\
19:03\
His children with\
all our hearts,\
19:08\
and strive to do as\
God has instructed us,\
19:12\
we will find healing and\
peace, happiness and meaning.\
19:17\
In the sacred name\
of our Master,\
19:21\
in the name of our Savior, in\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
