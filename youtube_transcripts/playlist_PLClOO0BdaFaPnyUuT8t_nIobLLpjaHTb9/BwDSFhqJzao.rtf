It is wonderful to be with you,\
my dear and precious sisters.\
0:06\
Perhaps a recent experience\
will give you a glimpse\
0:10\
into how I feel about you.\
0:15\
Your supernal abilities separate\
you from the rest of the world.\
0:22\
You are endowed with such\
extraordinary capacity.\
0:28\
Well, by way of confession, I'll\
say that one day while I was\
0:31\
speaking to a congregation\
in South America,\
0:33\
I became exceedingly\
excited about my topic,\
0:38\
and at a pivotal moment I said,\
"As the mother of 10 children,\
0:43\
I can tell you that ..."\
0:49\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:50\
And then I went on to\
complete my message.\
0:54\
I did not realize I had\
said the word mother.\
1:00\
My translator, assuming\
I had misspoken,\
1:03\
changed the word\
mother to father,\
1:05\
so the congregation\
never knew that I had\
1:07\
referred to myself as mother.\
1:12\
But my wife Wendy\
heard it, and she\
1:15\
was delighted with\
my Freudian slip.\
1:19\
[LAUGHTER]\
1:22\
In that moment, the deep\
longing of my heart to make\
1:26\
a difference in the world--like\
only a mother does--bubbled up\
1:30\
from my heart.\
1:33\
Through the years,\
whenever I have\
1:36\
been asked why I chose to\
become a medical doctor,\
1:40\
my answer was always the\
same: "Because I could not\
1:44\
choose to be a mother."\
1:47\
[LAUGHTER]\
1:58\
Please note that any time\
I use the word mother,\
2:01\
I am not only\
talking about women\
2:02\
who have given birth or\
adopted children in this life.\
2:06\
I am speaking about all of\
our Heavenly Parents' adult\
2:10\
daughters.\
2:12\
Every woman is a mother by\
virtue of her eternal divine\
2:18\
destiny.\
2:22\
So tonight, as the father of\
10 children--nine daughters\
2:29\
and one son--and as\
President of the Church,\
2:34\
I pray that you will sense how\
deeply I feel about you--about\
2:40\
who you are and all\
the good you can do.\
2:43\
No one else can do what\
a righteous woman can do.\
2:48\
No one can duplicate the\
influence of a mother.\
2:55\
Men can and often do communicate\
the love of Heavenly Father\
2:58\
and the Savior to others.\
3:00\
But women have a special gift\
for it--a divine endowment.\
3:09\
You have the capacity to sense\
what someone needs--and when\
3:15\
they need it.\
3:16\
You can reach out, comfort,\
teach, and strengthen someone\
3:21\
in his or her very\
moment of need.\
3:27\
Women see things differently\
than men do, and oh,\
3:31\
how we need your perspective!\
3:36\
Your nature leads you to\
think of others first,\
3:40\
to consider the effect\
that any course of action\
3:43\
will have on others.\
3:46\
As President Eyring pointed\
out, it was our glorious Mother\
3:51\
Eve--with her far-reaching\
vision of our Heavenly\
3:55\
Father's plan--who initiated\
what we call "the Fall."\
4:01\
Her wise and courageous choice\
and Adam's supporting decision\
4:07\
moved God's plan of\
happiness forward.\
4:11\
They made it possible for\
each of us to come to earth,\
4:15\
to receive a body\
and prove that we\
4:19\
would choose to stand\
up for Jesus Christ now,\
4:22\
just as we did premortally.\
4:28\
My dear sisters, you have\
special spiritual gifts\
4:32\
and propensities.\
4:34\
Tonight I urge you, with\
all the hope of my heart,\
4:39\
to pray to understand your\
spiritual gifts--to cultivate,\
4:45\
use, and expand them even\
more than you ever have.\
4:53\
You will change the\
world as you do so.\
4:57\
As women, you inspire\
others and set\
5:00\
a standard worthy of emulation.\
5:05\
Let me give you a\
little background\
5:07\
on two of the major\
announcements made\
5:09\
at our last general conference.\
5:11\
You, my dear sisters,\
were key to each.\
5:18\
First, ministering.\
5:21\
The supreme standard\
for ministering\
5:24\
is that of our\
Savior, Jesus Christ.\
5:27\
Generally women\
are, and always have\
5:32\
been, closer to that\
standard than men.\
5:37\
When you are truly ministering,\
you follow your feelings\
5:40\
to help someone else experience\
more of the Savior's love.\
5:46\
The inclination to minister is\
inherent in righteous women.\
5:51\
I know women who pray every\
day, "Whom wouldst Thou have\
5:56\
me help today?"\
6:00\
Before the April\
2018 announcement\
6:02\
about the higher and holier\
way of caring for others,\
6:05\
the tendency of some men was to\
check off their home teaching\
6:10\
assignment as "done" and\
move on to the next task.\
6:15\
But when you sensed that\
a sister you were visiting\
6:18\
teaching needed help, you\
responded immediately and then\
6:24\
throughout the month.\
6:25\
Thus, it was how\
you visit taught\
6:29\
that inspired our upward\
shift to ministering.\
6:36\
Second, in the last\
general conference\
6:39\
we also restructured\
Melchizedek Priesthood quorums.\
6:42\
When we wrestled with how to\
help the men of the Church\
6:46\
be more effective in\
their responsibilities,\
6:49\
we carefully considered the\
example of the Relief Society.\
6:55\
In Relief Society, women in\
various ages and stages of life\
7:00\
meet together.\
7:02\
Each decade of life\
brings unique challenges,\
7:05\
and yet there you\
were, week after week,\
7:09\
mingling together, growing and\
teaching the gospel together,\
7:13\
and making a real\
difference in the world.\
7:17\
Now, following your example,\
Melchizedek Priesthood bearers\
7:21\
are members of\
the elders quorum.\
7:23\
These men range in age from 18\
to 98--maybe more--with equally\
7:32\
wide-ranging priesthood\
and Church experiences.\
7:35\
These brethren can now create\
stronger fraternal linkages,\
7:40\
learn together, and bless\
others more effectively.\
7:47\
Remember last June,\
Sister Nelson and I\
7:49\
spoke to the youth\
of the Church.\
7:51\
We invited them to enlist in\
the Lord's youth battalion\
7:55\
to help gather Israel on\
both sides of the veil.\
8:01\
This gathering is the greatest\
challenge and the greatest\
8:05\
cause and the greatest\
work on earth today!\
8:11\
It is a cause that\
desperately needs women\
8:14\
because women shape the future.\
8:17\
So tonight I'm extending\
a prophetic plea\
8:21\
to you, the women of the Church,\
to shape the future by helping\
8:26\
to gather scattered Israel.\
8:31\
Where can you start?\
8:34\
May I offer four invitations:\
8:38\
First, I invite\
you to participate\
8:42\
in a 10-day fast\
from social media\
8:46\
and from any other\
media that bring\
8:49\
negative and impure\
thoughts to your mind.\
8:53\
Pray to know which influences\
to remove during your fast.\
9:00\
The effect of your 10-day\
fast may surprise you.\
9:04\
What do you notice\
after taking a break\
9:07\
from perspectives\
of the world that\
9:09\
have been wounding your spirit?\
9:13\
Is there a change in\
where you now want\
9:16\
to spend your time and energy?\
9:18\
Have any of your priorities\
shifted--just a little?\
9:24\
I urge you to record and follow\
through with each impression.\
9:31\
Second, I invite you to read\
the Book of Mormon between now\
9:37\
and the end of the year.\
9:40\
As impossible as that\
may seem with all\
9:43\
you are trying to\
manage in your life,\
9:45\
if you will accept\
this invitation\
9:48\
with full purpose\
of heart, the Lord\
9:50\
will help you find\
a way to achieve it.\
9:55\
And as you prayerfully study,\
I promise that the heavens\
9:59\
will open for you.\
10:02\
The Lord will bless you\
with increased inspiration\
10:07\
and revelation.\
10:11\
As you read, I\
would encourage you\
10:13\
to mark each verse that speaks\
of or refers to the Savior.\
10:19\
Then be intentional\
about talking of Christ,\
10:24\
rejoicing in Christ,\
and preaching of Christ\
10:28\
with your families and friends.\
10:31\
You and they will be\
drawn closer to the Savior\
10:35\
through this process.\
10:37\
And changes, even miracles,\
will begin to happen.\
10:46\
This morning the\
announcement was\
10:47\
made regarding the\
new Sunday schedule\
10:51\
and home-centered,\
Church-supported curriculum.\
10:55\
As has been taught here\
tonight, you, my dear sisters,\
11:00\
are a key to the success of this\
new, balanced, and coordinated\
11:07\
gospel-teaching effort.\
11:10\
Please teach those whom\
you love what you are\
11:14\
learning from the scriptures.\
11:16\
Teach them how to turn to\
the Savior for His healing\
11:19\
and cleansing power\
when they sin.\
11:23\
And teach them how to draw\
upon His strengthening\
11:26\
power every day of their lives.\
11:32\
Third, establish a pattern\
of regular temple attendance.\
11:38\
This may require a little\
more sacrifice in your life.\
11:43\
More regular time\
in the temple will\
11:46\
allow the Lord to\
teach you how to draw\
11:50\
upon His priesthood\
power with which you have\
11:53\
been endowed in His temple.\
11:59\
For those of you who\
don't live near a temple,\
12:01\
I invite you to\
study prayerfully\
12:02\
about temples in the scriptures\
and in the words of living\
12:07\
prophets.\
12:08\
Seek to know more,\
to understand more,\
12:11\
to feel more about temples\
than you ever have before.\
12:17\
In our worldwide\
youth devotional\
12:19\
last June, I spoke\
about a young man\
12:21\
whose life changed when\
his parents exchanged\
12:25\
his smartphone for a flip phone.\
12:33\
This young man's mother is\
a fearless woman of faith.\
12:38\
[LAUGHTER]\
12:40\
She saw her son drifting toward\
choices that could prevent him\
12:45\
from serving a mission.\
12:47\
She took her pleadings\
to the temple\
12:52\
to know how best\
to help her son.\
12:54\
Then she followed through\
with every impression.\
13:00\
She said: "I felt\
the Spirit guiding\
13:05\
me to check my son's\
phone at specific times\
13:08\
to catch specific things.\
13:11\
I don't know how to\
navigate these smartphones,\
13:15\
but the Spirit guided me\
through all the social media\
13:19\
that I don't even use!\
13:23\
I know the Spirit\
helps parents who\
13:25\
are seeking guidance to\
protect their children.\
13:28\
[At first] my son was\
furious with me. ...\
13:34\
But after only three\
days, he thanked me!\
13:39\
He could feel the difference."\
13:46\
Her son's behavior and\
attitudes changed dramatically.\
13:49\
He became more helpful\
at home, smiled more,\
13:53\
and was more\
attentive at church.\
13:56\
He loved serving for a\
time in a temple baptistry\
14:00\
and preparing for his mission.\
14:06\
My fourth invitation,\
for you who are of age,\
14:11\
is to participate fully\
in Relief Society.\
14:14\
I urge you to study the\
current Relief Society purpose\
14:19\
statement.\
14:21\
It is inspiring.\
14:23\
It may guide you in\
developing your own purpose\
14:27\
statement for your own life.\
14:32\
I also entreat you\
to savor the truths\
14:34\
in the Relief Society\
declaration published almost 20\
14:38\
years ago.\
14:40\
A framed copy of\
this declaration\
14:43\
hangs on the wall in the\
office of the First Presidency.\
14:47\
I am thrilled every\
time I read it.\
14:50\
It describes who you are\
and who the Lord needs\
14:53\
you to be at this precise time\
as you do your part to help\
14:59\
gather scattered Israel.\
15:04\
My dear sisters, we need you!\
15:09\
We "need your strength, your\
conversion, your conviction,\
15:14\
your ability to lead, your\
wisdom, and your voices."\
15:17\
We simply cannot gather\
Israel without you.\
15:26\
I love you and thank\
you and now bless you\
15:33\
with the ability to\
leave the world behind\
15:37\
as you assist in this\
crucial and urgent work.\
15:42\
Together we can do all that\
our Heavenly Father needs\
15:45\
us to do to prepare the\
world for the Second\
15:50\
Coming of His Beloved Son.\
15:55\
Jesus is the Christ.\
15:58\
This is His Church.\
16:00\
Of this I testify in the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
