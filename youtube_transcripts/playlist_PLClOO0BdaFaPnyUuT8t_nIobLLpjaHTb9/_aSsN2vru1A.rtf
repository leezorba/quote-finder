My dear brothers and sisters, I\
am grateful for the opportunity\
0:06\
to speak with you.\
0:08\
This conference has been\
uplifting and edifying for me.\
0:13\
The music sung and\
the words spoken\
0:17\
have been carried to our\
hearts by the Holy Ghost.\
0:22\
I pray that what I\
say will be conveyed\
0:25\
to you by that same Spirit.\
0:29\
Many years ago, I\
was first counselor\
0:32\
to a district president in\
the eastern United States.\
0:36\
More than once, as we were\
driving to our little branches\
0:41\
of the Church, he said to me,\
"Hal, when we meet someone,\
0:47\
treat them as if they\
were in serious trouble,\
0:52\
and you will be right\
more than half the time."\
0:58\
Not only was he right, but I\
have learned over the years\
1:02\
that he was too low\
in his estimate.\
1:05\
Today I wish to encourage\
you in the troubles you face.\
1:11\
Our mortal life is\
designed by a loving God\
1:15\
to be a test and source\
of growth for each of us.\
1:21\
You remember God's words\
regarding His children\
1:25\
at the Creation of\
the world: "And we\
1:28\
will prove them\
herewith, to see if they\
1:31\
will do all things whatsoever\
the Lord their God shall\
1:35\
command them."\
1:38\
Since the beginning, the\
tests have not been easy.\
1:43\
We face trials that come\
from having mortal bodies.\
1:48\
All of us live in a world\
where Satan's war against truth\
1:54\
and against our\
personal happiness\
1:57\
is becoming more intense.\
2:00\
The world and your\
life can seem to you\
2:06\
to be in increasing commotion.\
2:11\
My reassurance is this,\
simply: the loving God\
2:16\
who allowed these tests for\
you also designed a sure way\
2:24\
to pass through them.\
2:26\
Heavenly Father\
so loved the world\
2:30\
that He sent His\
Beloved Son to help us.\
2:34\
His Son, Jesus Christ,\
gave His life for us.\
2:39\
Jesus Christ bore in\
Gethsemane and on the cross\
2:43\
the weight of all our sins.\
2:46\
He experienced all the\
sorrows, the pains,\
2:52\
the effects of our\
sins so that He\
2:55\
could comfort us and strengthen\
us through every test in life.\
3:02\
You remember the Lord\
said to His servants:\
3:06\
"The Father and I are one.\
3:09\
I am in the Father\
and the Father in me;\
3:13\
and inasmuch as ye have received\
me, ye are in me and I in you.\
3:23\
"Wherefore, I am\
in your midst, ...\
3:25\
I am the good shepherd,\
and the stone of Israel.\
3:30\
He that buildeth upon this\
rock shall never fall."\
3:37\
Our prophet, President\
Russell M. Nelson,\
3:40\
has also given that\
same assurance.\
3:44\
Moreover, he described a way\
we might build upon that rock\
3:50\
and put the Lord's\
name upon our hearts\
3:53\
to guide us through our trials.\
3:57\
He said: "You ...\
3:59\
may be momentarily\
disheartened, remember,\
4:04\
life is not meant to be easy.\
4:06\
Trials must be borne and\
grief endured along the way.\
4:12\
As you remember that\
'with God nothing shall be\
4:17\
impossible,' know that\
He is your Father.\
4:20\
You are a son or daughter\
created in His image, entitled\
4:25\
through your worthiness to\
receive revelation to help\
4:30\
with your righteous endeavors.\
4:32\
You may take upon you the\
holy name of the Lord.\
4:38\
You can qualify to speak\
in the sacred name of God."\
4:47\
President Nelson's\
words remind us\
4:50\
of the promise found in the\
sacramental prayer, a promise\
4:57\
our Heavenly Father fulfills\
as we do what we in turn\
5:02\
promise to do.\
5:03\
Listen to the words: "O\
God, the Eternal Father, we\
5:10\
ask thee in the name of thy\
Son, Jesus Christ, to bless\
5:15\
and sanctify this bread\
to the souls of all those\
5:20\
who partake of it, that\
they may eat in remembrance\
5:24\
of the body of thy Son,\
and witness unto thee, O\
5:29\
God, the Eternal\
Father, that they\
5:32\
are willing to take upon\
them the name of thy Son,\
5:36\
and always remember him and keep\
his commandments which he has\
5:41\
given them; that they may\
always have his Spirit\
5:45\
to be with them.\
5:47\
Amen."\
5:49\
Each time we say the word amen\
when that prayer is offered\
5:54\
on our behalf, we pledge that\
by partaking of the bread,\
5:59\
we are willing to take upon us\
the holy name of Jesus Christ,\
6:05\
always remember Him, and\
keep His commandments.\
6:08\
In turn, we are promised\
that we may always\
6:12\
have His Spirit to be with us.\
6:15\
Because of these\
promises, the Savior\
6:19\
is the rock upon which\
we can stand safely\
6:23\
and without fear in\
every storm we face.\
6:29\
As I have pondered\
the covenant words\
6:30\
and corresponding\
blessings promised,\
6:33\
I have wondered\
what it means to be\
6:36\
willing to take upon us\
the name of Jesus Christ.\
6:41\
President Dallin H. Oaks\
explains: "It is significant\
6:47\
that when we partake\
of the sacrament\
6:49\
we do not witness\
that we take upon us\
6:52\
the name of Jesus Christ.\
6:55\
We witness that we\
are willing to do so.\
6:59\
The fact that we only\
witness to our willingness\
7:03\
suggests that something else\
must happen before we actually\
7:09\
take that sacred name upon us\
in the most important sense."\
7:18\
The statement that we are\
"willing to take upon [us]"\
7:21\
His name tells us that while\
we first take the Savior's name\
7:25\
when we were baptized,\
taking His name\
7:28\
is not finished at baptism.\
7:30\
We must work continually to take\
His name throughout our lives,\
7:35\
including when we\
renew covenants\
7:38\
at the sacrament table\
and make covenants\
7:41\
in the Lord's holy temples.\
7:45\
So two crucial\
questions for each of us\
7:50\
become "What must I be doing\
to take His name upon me?"\
7:57\
and "How will I know when\
I am making progress?"\
8:04\
The statement of\
President Nelson\
8:06\
suggests one helpful answer.\
8:09\
He said that we could take\
the name of the Savior upon us\
8:13\
and that we could speak for Him.\
8:15\
When we speak for\
Him, we serve Him.\
8:19\
Remember the quotation: "For how\
knoweth a man the master whom\
8:24\
he has not served, and who\
is a stranger unto him,\
8:28\
and is far from the thoughts\
and intents of his heart?"\
8:34\
Speaking for Him requires\
a prayer of faith.\
8:38\
It takes fervent prayer\
to Heavenly Father\
8:42\
to learn what words\
we could speak\
8:45\
to help the Savior in His work.\
8:48\
We must qualify for the promise:\
"Whether by mine own voice\
8:54\
or by the voice of my\
servants, it is the same."\
9:01\
Yet it takes more\
than speaking for Him\
9:03\
to take His name upon us.\
9:05\
There are feelings in\
our hearts we must have\
9:10\
to qualify as His servants.\
9:15\
The prophet Mormon\
described the feelings\
9:17\
that qualify us and enable\
us to take His name upon us.\
9:22\
These feelings include faith,\
hope, and charity, which\
9:29\
is the pure love of Christ.\
9:31\
Mormon explained to\
people just like you:\
9:37\
"For I judge that ye have\
faith in Christ because\
9:40\
of your meekness; for if\
ye have not faith in him\
9:44\
then ye are not\
fit to be numbered\
9:47\
among the people of his church.\
9:50\
"And again, my beloved\
brethren [and sisters],\
9:52\
I would speak unto\
you concerning hope.\
9:55\
How is it that ye can\
attain unto faith,\
9:57\
save ye shall have hope?\
10:00\
"And what is it that\
ye shall hope for?\
10:02\
Behold I say unto you\
that ye shall have hope\
10:04\
through the atonement\
of Christ and the power\
10:08\
of his resurrection,\
to be raised unto life\
10:12\
eternal, and this\
because of your faith\
10:15\
in him according to the promise.\
10:17\
"Wherefore, if a man have\
faith he must needs have hope;\
10:22\
for without faith there\
cannot be any hope.\
10:25\
"And again, behold I say unto\
you that he cannot have faith\
10:28\
and hope, save he shall be\
meek, and lowly of heart.\
10:34\
"If so, his faith\
and hope is vain,\
10:36\
for none is\
acceptable before God,\
10:38\
save the meek and\
lowly in heart;\
10:42\
and if a man be meek\
and lowly in heart,\
10:44\
and confesses by the\
power of the Holy Ghost\
10:47\
that Jesus is the\
Christ, he must needs\
10:50\
have charity; for if he have\
not charity he is nothing;\
10:55\
wherefore he must\
needs have charity."\
10:58\
After describing charity,\
Mormon goes on to say:\
11:02\
"But charity is the\
pure love of Christ,\
11:04\
and it endureth\
forever; and whoso\
11:07\
is found possessed of\
it at the last day,\
11:10\
it shall be well with him.\
11:12\
"Wherefore, my beloved\
brethren [and sisters],\
11:15\
[I] pray unto the Father\
with all the energy of heart,\
11:19\
that ye may be filled\
with this love,\
11:21\
which he hath bestowed upon all\
[those] who are true followers\
11:24\
of his Son, Jesus Christ; that\
ye may become the sons of God;\
11:29\
that when he shall appear\
we shall be like him,\
11:32\
for we shall see him as he is;\
that we may have this hope;\
11:37\
that we may be purified\
even as he is pure.\
11:41\
Amen."\
11:43\
My testimony is that the\
Savior is putting His name\
11:46\
in your hearts.\
11:48\
For many of you, your\
faith in Him is increasing.\
11:52\
You are feeling more\
hope and optimism.\
11:56\
And you are feeling\
the pure love of Christ\
11:58\
for others and for yourself.\
12:02\
I see it in our missionaries\
serving all over the world.\
12:06\
I see it in members\
who are speaking\
12:08\
to their friends\
and family members\
12:11\
about The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
12:15\
Men, women, young\
people, and even children\
12:19\
are ministering out\
of love for the Savior\
12:21\
and for their neighbors.\
12:23\
At the first report of disasters\
across the world, which are now\
12:27\
so frequent, members make plans\
to go to the rescue, sometimes\
12:32\
across oceans,\
without being asked.\
12:35\
They sometimes find it hard to\
wait until the devastated areas\
12:39\
can receive them.\
12:41\
I realize that some\
of you listening today\
12:44\
may feel that your\
faith and hope are being\
12:47\
overcome by your troubles.\
12:49\
And you may yearn to feel love.\
12:53\
Brothers and sisters, the Lord\
has opportunities near you\
12:57\
to feel and to share His love.\
12:59\
You can pray with\
confidence for the Lord\
13:03\
to lead you to someone for Him.\
13:07\
He answers the prayers of\
meek volunteers like you.\
13:13\
You will feel the love of God\
for you and for the person\
13:17\
you serve for Him.\
13:18\
As you help children of\
God in their troubles,\
13:22\
your own troubles\
will seem lighter.\
13:25\
Your faith and your hope\
will be strengthened.\
13:28\
I am an eyewitness\
of that truth.\
13:30\
Over a lifetime, my wife\
has spoken for the Lord\
13:33\
and served people for\
Him in many places.\
13:36\
As I've mentioned before, one\
of our bishops once said to me,\
13:41\
"Brother Eyring, I'm amazed.\
13:43\
Every time I hear of a person\
in the ward who is in trouble,\
13:47\
I hurry to help.\
13:48\
Yet by the time I arrive,\
it seems that your wife\
13:51\
has already been there."\
13:53\
That has been true\
in all the places\
13:57\
we have lived for 56 years.\
14:01\
Now she can speak only\
a few words a day.\
14:04\
She is visited by people\
she loved for the Lord.\
14:07\
Every night and morning I sing\
hymns with her and we pray.\
14:11\
I have to be voice in the\
prayers and in the songs.\
14:16\
Sometimes I can see her\
mouthing the words of the hymns.\
14:19\
She prefers children's songs.\
14:22\
The sentiment she seems to like\
best is summarized in the song\
14:25\
"I'm Trying to Be like Jesus."\
14:28\
The other day, after singing\
the words of the chorus:\
14:31\
"Love one another\
as Jesus loves you.\
14:33\
Try to show kindness\
in all that you do,"\
14:36\
she said softly but\
clearly, "Try, try, try."\
14:44\
I think she will find,\
when she sees Him,\
14:49\
that our Savior has put\
His name into her heart\
14:54\
and that she has\
become like Him.\
14:56\
He is carrying her\
through her troubles\
14:59\
now, as He will carry\
you through yours.\
15:04\
I bear you my witness that the\
Savior knows and loves you.\
15:08\
He knows your name\
as you know His.\
15:12\
He knows your troubles.\
15:14\
He has experienced them.\
15:16\
By His Atonement, He\
has overcome the world.\
15:19\
By your being willing to\
take His name upon you,\
15:22\
you will lift the burdens\
of countless others.\
15:26\
And you will find in time that\
you know the Savior better\
15:29\
and that you love Him more.\
15:31\
His name will be in your heart\
and fixed in your memory.\
15:35\
it is the name by which\
you will be called.\
15:38\
I so witness, with gratitude\
for His loving-kindness\
15:42\
to me, to my loved\
ones, and to you,\
15:45\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
