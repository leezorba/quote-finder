I add my witness to the messages\
of President Nelson and Elder\
0:06\
Cook given moments ago of\
the harmony and unanimity\
0:11\
of the Council of\
the First Presidency\
0:14\
and Quorum of the\
Twelve Apostles.\
0:16\
I know these revelatory\
announcements\
0:20\
are the mind and\
the will of the Lord\
0:22\
and will bless and strengthen\
individuals, families,\
0:26\
and The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day\
0:29\
Saints for generations to come.\
0:33\
Some years ago, one of our\
young married daughters\
0:37\
and her husband\
asked Sister Rasband\
0:39\
and me a very important,\
life-influencing question:\
0:44\
"Is it still safe and\
wise to bring children\
0:48\
into this seemingly wicked and\
frightening world we live in?"\
0:54\
Now, that was an important\
question for a mom and dad\
0:57\
to consider with their\
dear married children.\
1:01\
We could hear the\
fear in their voices,\
1:04\
and we felt the fear\
in their hearts.\
1:08\
Our answer to them\
was a firm "Yes, it's\
1:11\
more than OK," as we\
shared fundamental gospel\
1:16\
teachings and our own\
heartfelt impressions and life\
1:20\
experiences.\
1:23\
Fear is not new.\
1:25\
The disciples of Jesus Christ\
out on the Sea of Galilee\
1:29\
feared the wind and the\
waves in the dark of night.\
1:33\
As His disciples today,\
we too have fears.\
1:38\
Our single adults fear\
making commitments\
1:41\
such as getting married; young\
marrieds, like our children,\
1:46\
can fear bringing children into\
an increasingly wicked world.\
1:51\
Missionaries fear lots of\
things, especially approaching\
1:55\
strangers.\
1:56\
Widows fear going forward alone.\
1:59\
Teenagers fear not\
being accepted;\
2:02\
grade-schoolers fear\
the first day of school;\
2:05\
university students fear\
getting back a test.\
2:09\
We fear failure,\
rejection, disappointment,\
2:18\
and the unknown.\
2:20\
We fear hurricanes,\
earthquakes, and fires that\
2:25\
ravage the land and our lives.\
2:29\
We fear not being chosen,\
and on the flip side,\
2:33\
we fear being chosen.\
2:37\
We fear not being\
good enough; we\
2:40\
fear that the Lord has\
no blessings for us.\
2:43\
We fear change, and our\
fears can escalate to terror.\
2:49\
Have I included just\
about everyone now?\
2:54\
Since ancient times, fear\
has limited the perspective\
2:58\
of God's children.\
3:00\
I have always loved the\
account of Elisha in 2 Kings.\
3:05\
The king of Syria had sent a\
legion that "came by night,\
3:09\
and compassed the city about."\
3:12\
Their intent was to capture\
and kill the prophet Elisha.\
3:17\
We read:\
3:19\
"And when the servant\
of the man of God\
3:20\
was risen early, and gone\
forth, behold, an host\
3:25\
compassed the city both\
with horses and chariots.\
3:29\
And his servant said unto\
him, Alas, my master!\
3:34\
How shall we do?"\
3:36\
That was fear speaking.\
3:40\
"And [Elisha] answered,\
Fear not: for they\
3:44\
that be with us are more\
than they that be with them."\
3:48\
But he didn't stop there.\
3:50\
"Elisha prayed, and\
said, Lord, I pray thee,\
3:54\
open his eyes, that he may see.\
3:57\
And the Lord opened the eyes\
of the young man; and he saw:\
4:02\
and, behold, the mountain was\
full of horses and chariots\
4:06\
of fire round about Elisha."\
4:11\
We may or may not\
have chariots of fire\
4:14\
sent to dispel our fears\
and conquer our demons,\
4:18\
but the lesson is clear.\
4:21\
The Lord is with\
us, mindful of us,\
4:24\
and blessing us in\
ways only He can do.\
4:28\
Prayer can call down the\
strength and the revelation\
4:32\
that we need to center our\
thoughts on Jesus Christ\
4:35\
and His atoning sacrifice.\
4:38\
The Lord knew that at\
times we would feel fear.\
4:42\
I have been there,\
and so have you,\
4:45\
which is why the scriptures\
are replete with the Lord's\
4:49\
counsel:\
4:51\
"Be of good cheer,\
and do not fear."\
4:54\
"Look unto me in every\
thought; doubt not, fear not."\
5:00\
"Fear not, little flock."\
5:02\
I love the tenderness\
of "little flock."\
5:06\
In this Church we may be\
few in number by the way\
5:10\
the world counts\
influence, but when\
5:13\
we open our spiritual\
eyes, "they that be with us\
5:17\
are more than they\
that be with them."\
5:21\
Our loving Shepherd, Jesus\
Christ, then continues,\
5:25\
"Let earth and hell\
combine against you,\
5:28\
for if ye are built upon my\
rock, they cannot prevail."\
5:34\
How is fear dispelled?\
5:36\
For the young lad, he was\
standing right next to Elisha,\
5:40\
a prophet of God.\
5:42\
We have that same promise.\
5:44\
When we listen to President\
Russell M. Nelson, when\
5:48\
we hearken to his\
counsel, we are\
5:50\
standing with a prophet of God.\
5:53\
Remember the words\
of Joseph Smith:\
5:56\
"And now, after the\
many testimonies which\
5:59\
have been given of him,\
this is the testimony,\
6:02\
last of all, which we give\
of him: That he lives!"\
6:06\
Jesus Christ lives.\
6:10\
Our love for Him and\
His gospel dispels fear.\
6:17\
Our desire to "always have\
His Spirit" with us will push\
6:21\
fear aside for a more eternal\
view of our mortal lives.\
6:26\
President Nelson has\
cautioned, "In coming days,\
6:31\
it will not be possible\
to survive spiritually\
6:34\
without the guiding,\
directing, comforting,\
6:38\
and constant influence\
of the Holy Ghost."\
6:42\
The Lord said,\
regarding the scourges\
6:44\
that would cover the\
land and would harden\
6:47\
the hearts of\
many, "My disciples\
6:50\
shall stand in holy places,\
and shall not be moved."\
6:56\
AND THEN THIS DIVINE COUNSEL:\
"Be not troubled, for,\
7:00\
when all these things\
shall come to pass,\
7:03\
ye may know that the\
promises which have been made\
7:06\
unto you shall be fulfilled."\
7:10\
Stand in holy places, be\
not troubled, and promises\
7:15\
shall be fulfilled.\
7:16\
Let's look at each one of\
these in relation to our fears.\
7:22\
First, stand in holy places.\
7:25\
When we stand in holy\
places--our righteous homes,\
7:29\
our dedicated chapels, the\
consecrated temples--we feel\
7:34\
the Spirit of the Lord with us.\
7:36\
We find answers to\
questions that trouble us\
7:40\
or the peace to\
simply set them aside.\
7:44\
That is the Spirit in action.\
7:47\
These sacred places in the\
kingdom of God on earth\
7:51\
call for our reverence, our\
respect of others, our best\
7:55\
selves in living\
the gospel, and our\
7:58\
hopes to lay aside our fears and\
seek the healing power of Jesus\
8:03\
Christ through His Atonement.\
8:07\
There is no room for fear\
in these holy places of God\
8:10\
or in the hearts\
of His children.\
8:13\
Why?\
8:14\
Because of love.\
8:16\
God loves us--always--and\
we love Him.\
8:20\
Our love of God counters\
all fears, and His love\
8:24\
abounds in holy places.\
8:27\
Think about it.\
8:28\
When we are tentative in\
our commitments to the Lord,\
8:32\
when we stray from His path\
leading to life eternal,\
8:36\
when we question or doubt our\
significance in His divine\
8:40\
design, when we allow fear\
to open the door to all its\
8:45\
companions--discouragement,\
anger, frustration,\
8:50\
disappointment--the\
Spirit leaves us,\
8:53\
and we are without the Lord.\
8:56\
If you know what\
that is like, you\
8:59\
know it is not a\
good place to be.\
9:02\
In contrast, when we\
stand in holy places,\
9:06\
we can feel God's\
love, and "perfect love\
9:10\
casteth out all fear."\
9:14\
The next promise is\
"Be not troubled."\
9:17\
No matter how much wickedness\
and chaos fills the earth,\
9:22\
we are promised by our daily\
faithfulness in Jesus Christ\
9:27\
the "peace of God, which\
passeth all understanding."\
9:31\
And when Christ comes in\
all power and glory, evil,\
9:36\
rebellion, and\
injustice will end.\
9:41\
Long ago the Apostle Paul\
prophesied of our times,\
9:45\
saying to the young Timothy:\
9:47\
"This know also,\
that in the last days\
9:50\
perilous times shall come.\
9:52\
"For men shall be lovers of\
their own selves, covetous,\
9:56\
boasters, proud, blasphemers,\
disobedient to parents,\
10:00\
unthankful, unholy, ...\
10:02\
"... lovers of pleasures\
more than lovers of God."\
10:07\
Remember, "they that be with\
us" on both sides of the veil,\
10:12\
those who love the Lord with\
all their heart, might, mind,\
10:16\
and strength, "are more than\
they that be with them."\
10:20\
If we actively trust in\
the Lord and His ways,\
10:24\
if we are engaged\
in His work, we\
10:26\
will not fear the trends of the\
world or be troubled by them.\
10:31\
I plead with you to set\
aside worldly influences\
10:35\
and pressures and\
seek spirituality\
10:38\
in your daily life.\
10:40\
Love what the Lord loves--which\
includes His commandments,\
10:44\
His holy houses, our\
sacred covenants with Him,\
10:48\
the sacrament each Sabbath\
day, our communication through\
10:52\
prayer--and you will\
not be troubled.\
10:57\
THE LAST POINT: trust the\
Lord and His promises.\
11:01\
I know that all His\
promises will be fulfilled.\
11:04\
I know it as firmly as\
I stand here before you\
11:08\
in this sacred meeting.\
11:11\
THE LORD HAS REVEALED: "For they\
that are wise and have received\
11:15\
the truth, and have taken the\
Holy Spirit for their guide,\
11:19\
and have not been\
deceived--verily I say unto\
11:22\
you, they shall not be hewn\
down and cast into the fire,\
11:27\
but shall abide the day."\
11:31\
That is why we should\
not be troubled\
11:33\
by the turmoil of\
today, by those\
11:35\
in the great and\
spacious building,\
11:38\
by those who scoff\
at honest effort\
11:40\
and dedicated service to\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
11:45\
Optimism, courage, even\
charity come from a heart\
11:50\
not burdened by\
troubles or turmoil.\
11:54\
President Nelson, who is\
"optimistic about the future,"\
11:58\
has reminded us,\
"If we are to have\
12:01\
any hope of sifting through\
the myriad of voices\
12:05\
and the philosophies of\
men that attack truth,\
12:09\
we must learn to\
receive revelation."\
12:13\
To receive personal\
revelation, we\
12:16\
must place priority\
on living the gospel\
12:19\
and encouraging faithfulness and\
spirituality in others as well\
12:25\
as ourselves.\
12:28\
Spencer W. Kimball was one\
of the prophets of my youth.\
12:32\
These past few years, after\
being called as an Apostle,\
12:36\
I have found peace in his first\
message at general conference\
12:40\
in October 1943.\
12:43\
He was overwhelmed by his call;\
I know what that feels like.\
12:49\
Elder Kimball said:\
"I did a great deal\
12:53\
of thinking and praying,\
and fasting and praying.\
12:57\
There were conflicting\
thoughts that surged through\
12:59\
my mind--seeming voices\
saying: 'You can't do the work.\
13:04\
You are not worthy.\
13:06\
You have not the ability'--and\
always finally came\
13:10\
the triumphant thought: 'You\
must do the work assigned--you\
13:14\
must make yourself able,\
worthy, and qualified.'\
13:18\
And the battle raged on."\
13:23\
I take heart from that\
pure-hearted testimony\
13:26\
of this Apostle who would\
become the 12th President\
13:29\
of this mighty Church.\
13:31\
He recognized he had to put his\
fears to "do the work assigned"\
13:38\
and that he had to rely on\
the Lord for the strength\
13:42\
to make himself "able,\
worthy, and qualified."\
13:46\
We can too.\
13:48\
The battles will rage\
on, but we will face them\
13:51\
with the Spirit of the Lord.\
13:53\
We will "be not\
troubled" because when\
13:57\
we stand with the Lord and\
stand for His principles\
14:01\
and His eternal plan, we\
are standing on holy ground.\
14:07\
Now, what about that\
daughter and son-in-law\
14:11\
who asked the very heartfelt\
and probing, fear-based question\
14:16\
years ago?\
14:22\
They seriously considered\
our conversation that night;\
14:26\
they prayed and fasted and\
came to their own conclusions.\
14:31\
Happily and joyfully, for them\
and for us, the grandparents,\
14:37\
they have now been blessed\
with seven beautiful children\
14:41\
as they go forward\
in faith and love.\
14:48\
Take heart, brothers\
and sisters.\
14:50\
Yes, we live in perilous times,\
but as we stay on the covenant\
14:55\
path, we need not fear.\
14:58\
I bless you that\
as you do so, you\
15:02\
will not be troubled by\
the times in which we live\
15:04\
or the troubles\
that come your way.\
15:08\
I bless you to choose\
to stand in holy places\
15:11\
and be not moved.\
15:13\
I bless you to believe in\
the promises of Jesus Christ,\
15:18\
that He lives, He is watching\
over us, caring for us,\
15:23\
and standing by us.\
15:25\
In the name of our Lord and\
Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.\
