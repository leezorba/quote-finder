A few months into his\
mission, our youngest son\
0:03\
and his missionary companion\
were completing their study\
0:06\
when our son felt a\
dull pain in his head.\
0:09\
He felt very\
strange; at first he\
0:12\
lost control of his left arm;\
then his tongue went numb.\
0:16\
The left side of his\
face began to droop.\
0:19\
He had difficulty speaking.\
0:20\
He knew something was wrong.\
0:22\
What he didn't know\
was that he was\
0:24\
in the middle of a\
massive stroke in three\
0:26\
areas of his brain.\
0:28\
Fear began to set in as he\
became partially paralyzed.\
0:32\
How quickly a stroke\
victim receives care\
0:34\
can have a dramatic effect\
on the extent of his healing.\
0:37\
His faithful missionary\
companion acted decisively.\
0:41\
After calling 911, he\
gave him a blessing.\
0:45\
Miraculously, the ambulance\
was only five minutes away.\
0:50\
After our son was\
rushed to the hospital,\
0:52\
the medical personnel quickly\
assessed the situation\
0:55\
and determined they should\
administer a medicine\
0:57\
to our son that\
could potentially\
0:59\
reverse the stroke's\
paralyzing effects over time.\
1:02\
However, if our son was\
not having a stroke,\
1:05\
the medicine could have\
severe consequences,\
1:07\
such as bleeding in the brain.\
1:09\
Our son had to choose.\
1:11\
He chose to accept\
the medication.\
1:14\
While full recovery\
required more operations\
1:18\
and many months,\
our son eventually\
1:20\
returned and\
completed his mission\
1:22\
after the effects of the stroke\
were substantially reversed.\
1:27\
Our Heavenly Father is\
all-powerful and all-knowing.\
1:30\
He knows our physical struggles.\
1:32\
He is aware of\
our physical pains\
1:34\
due to illness, disease, aging,\
accidents, or birth disorders.\
1:39\
He is aware of emotional\
struggles associated\
1:42\
with anxiety, loneliness,\
depression, or mental illness.\
1:47\
He knows each person who\
has suffered injustice\
1:50\
or who has been abused.\
1:52\
He knows our weaknesses\
and the propensities\
1:55\
and temptations\
we struggle with.\
1:58\
During mortality we\
are tested to see if we\
2:00\
will choose good over evil.\
2:02\
For those who keep\
His commandments,\
2:04\
they will live\
with Him in a state\
2:05\
of never-ending happiness.\
2:07\
To help us in our progression\
to become like Him,\
2:10\
Heavenly Father has given\
all power and knowledge\
2:13\
to His Son, Jesus Christ.\
2:15\
There is no physical, emotional,\
or spiritual ailment that\
2:19\
Christ cannot heal.\
2:22\
During the mortal\
ministry of the Savior,\
2:24\
the scriptures recount\
many miraculous events\
2:26\
where Jesus Christ used\
His divine power to heal\
2:29\
those who suffered physically.\
2:32\
The Gospel of John\
recounts the story\
2:34\
of a certain man who had\
endured a debilitating\
2:36\
infirmity for 38 years.\
2:40\
"When Jesus saw\
him lie, and knew\
2:41\
that he had been now a\
long time in that case,\
2:44\
he saith unto him, Wilt\
thou be made whole?"\
2:49\
The impotent man\
responded that no one\
2:51\
was around to help him\
when he needed it most.\
2:54\
"Jesus saith unto him, Rise,\
take up thy bed and walk.\
2:59\
"And immediately the\
man was made whole,\
3:02\
and took up his\
bed, and walked."\
3:04\
Please note the juxtaposition\
of how long this man suffered\
3:07\
on his own--38 years--and how\
quickly the healing came once\
3:12\
the Savior became involved.\
3:14\
The healing was immediate.\
3:17\
In another instance, a woman\
with an issue of blood 12\
3:20\
years, who "had spent all [of]\
her living upon physicians, ...\
3:23\
came behind him, and touched\
the border of his garment:\
3:26\
and immediately her\
issue of blood [ceased].\
3:28\
...\
3:29\
"And Jesus said,\
Somebody hath touched me:\
3:32\
for I perceive that\
virtue is gone out of me.\
3:35\
And when the woman saw that\
she was not hid, she ...\
3:38\
declared unto him before\
all the people ...\
3:40\
how she was healed immediately."\
3:44\
Through His ministry,\
Christ taught\
3:46\
that He had power over\
the physical body.\
3:48\
We cannot control the timing\
of when Christ's healing\
3:52\
of our physical\
ailments will occur.\
3:55\
Healing occurs according\
to His will and wisdom.\
4:00\
In the scriptures, some\
suffered for decades; others,\
4:03\
their entire mortal lives.\
4:05\
Mortal infirmities can refine\
us and deepen our reliance\
4:08\
upon God.\
4:10\
But when we allow\
Christ to be involved,\
4:12\
He will always strengthen\
us spiritually so\
4:16\
we can have greater capacity\
to endure our burdens.\
4:20\
Ultimately, we know that every\
physical ailment, malady,\
4:23\
or imperfection will be\
healed in the Resurrection.\
4:26\
That is a gift to all\
mankind through the Atonement\
4:29\
of Jesus Christ.\
4:31\
Jesus Christ can heal more\
than just our physical bodies.\
4:34\
He can heal our spirits as well.\
4:36\
Throughout scripture\
we learn how\
4:38\
Christ helped those\
whose spirits were weak\
4:41\
and made them whole.\
4:42\
As we ponder these\
experiences, our hope and faith\
4:46\
in the Savior's power to\
bless our lives increases.\
4:49\
Jesus Christ can\
change our hearts,\
4:52\
heal us from the effects\
of injustice or abuse\
4:55\
we may experience, and\
strengthen our capacity\
4:58\
to bear loss and\
heartache, bringing us\
5:01\
peace to help us endure\
the trials of our lives,\
5:04\
healing us emotionally.\
5:07\
Christ can also\
heal us when we sin.\
5:09\
We sin when we knowingly\
break one of God's laws.\
5:13\
When we sin, our\
soul becomes unclean.\
5:16\
No unclean thing can\
dwell in God's presence.\
5:19\
Becoming clean from sin is\
to be healed spiritually.\
5:24\
God the Father\
knows we will sin,\
5:27\
but He has prepared a way\
for us to be redeemed.\
5:30\
Elder Lynn G. Robbins\
taught: "Repentance\
5:33\
isn't [God's] backup plan\
in the event we might fail.\
5:37\
Repentance is His plan,\
knowing that we will."\
5:42\
When we sin, we\
have the opportunity\
5:45\
to choose the good\
from the evil.\
5:47\
We choose the good when we\
repent after we have sinned.\
5:50\
Through Jesus Christ and\
His atoning sacrifice,\
5:54\
we can be redeemed from\
our sins and brought back\
5:58\
to the presence of God\
the Father--if we repent.\
6:01\
Spiritual healing\
is not one-sided;\
6:05\
it requires the Savior's\
redemptive power and sincere\
6:08\
repentance on the\
part of the sinner.\
6:10\
For those who choose\
not to repent,\
6:13\
they are rejecting the\
healing Christ offers.\
6:16\
For them, it is as though\
no redemption was made.\
6:22\
As I have counseled with\
others seeking to repent,\
6:24\
I have marveled that people\
who were living in sin\
6:26\
had difficulty making\
correct decisions.\
6:29\
The Holy Ghost would\
leave them, and they often\
6:32\
struggled to make choices that\
would bring them closer to God.\
6:35\
They would wrestle for\
months or even years,\
6:38\
embarrassed or frightened of\
the consequences of their sins.\
6:42\
Often they felt that they could\
never change or be forgiven.\
6:46\
I have often heard them share\
their fear that if their loved\
6:49\
ones knew what they had done,\
they would stop loving them\
6:53\
or leave them.\
6:54\
When they followed\
this line of thinking,\
6:56\
they resolved to just keep quiet\
and delay their repentance.\
7:00\
They incorrectly felt\
that it was better\
7:02\
not to repent now so that\
they would not further\
7:05\
hurt those they loved.\
7:07\
In their minds it was better\
to suffer after this life\
7:10\
than go through the\
repentance process now.\
7:13\
Brothers and\
sisters, it is never\
7:17\
a good idea to procrastinate\
your repentance.\
7:20\
The adversary often\
uses fear to prevent us\
7:23\
from acting immediately upon\
our faith in Jesus Christ.\
7:28\
When loved ones are\
confronted with the truth\
7:30\
about sinful behavior, while\
they may feel deeply wounded,\
7:34\
they often want to help\
the sincerely repentant\
7:37\
sinner to change and\
to reconcile with God.\
7:41\
Indeed, spiritual\
healing accelerates\
7:44\
when the sinner confesses\
and is surrounded\
7:46\
by those who love them and help\
them to forsake their sins.\
7:50\
Please remember\
that Jesus Christ\
7:52\
is mighty in how He also heals\
the innocent victims of sin who\
7:55\
turn to Him.\
7:57\
Elder Boyd K. Packer\
stated: "Our spirits\
8:00\
are damaged when we make\
mistakes and commit sins.\
8:03\
But unlike the case\
of our mortal bodies,\
8:06\
when the repentance\
process is complete,\
8:08\
no scars remain because of\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
8:12\
The promise is: 'Behold, he\
who has repented of his sins,\
8:17\
the same is forgiven, and I, the\
Lord, remember them no more.'"\
8:22\
When we repent "with\
full purpose of heart,"\
8:25\
"immediately shall the\
great plan of redemption\
8:27\
be brought about" in our lives.\
8:29\
The Savior will heal us.\
8:33\
The missionary companion and\
the medical professionals\
8:36\
who helped our stroke-afflicted\
son in the mission field\
8:39\
acted quickly.\
8:40\
Our son chose to receive the\
stroke-reversing medicine.\
8:44\
The paralyzing\
effects of his stroke\
8:46\
that could have followed\
him for the remainder\
8:48\
of his mortal life\
were reversed.\
8:50\
Likewise, the faster\
we repent and bring\
8:54\
the Atonement of Jesus\
Christ into our lives,\
8:56\
the sooner we can be healed\
from the effects of sin.\
9:00\
President Russell M. Nelson\
offered this invitation:\
9:03\
"If you have stepped\
off the path, ...\
9:06\
I invite you ... to\
please come back.\
9:09\
Whatever your concerns,\
whatever your challenges,\
9:13\
there is a place for you\
in this, the Lord's Church.\
9:16\
You and generations yet unborn\
will be blessed by your actions\
9:20\
now to return to\
the covenant path."\
9:24\
Our spiritual\
healing requires us\
9:26\
to submit ourselves\
to the conditions\
9:27\
our Savior has outlined.\
9:29\
We must not delay!\
9:31\
We must act today!\
9:33\
Act now so that\
spiritual paralysis\
9:36\
does not prevent your\
eternal progression.\
9:40\
While I have been speaking,\
if you have felt the need\
9:43\
to ask forgiveness of\
someone you have wronged,\
9:46\
I invite you to act.\
9:48\
Tell them what you have done.\
9:50\
Ask for their forgiveness.\
9:52\
If you have committed a sin that\
impacts your temple worthiness,\
9:56\
I invite you to counsel\
with your bishop--today.\
9:59\
Do not delay.\
10:03\
My brothers and sisters, God\
is our loving Father in Heaven.\
10:06\
He has given all\
power and knowledge\
10:08\
to His Beloved\
Son, Jesus Christ.\
10:11\
Because of Him, all\
mankind will one day\
10:13\
be healed of every\
physical ailment forever.\
10:16\
Because of the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ,\
10:19\
if we choose to repent and turn\
our hearts fully to the Savior,\
10:22\
He will heal us spiritually.\
10:25\
That healing can\
begin immediately.\
10:28\
The choice is ours.\
10:30\
Will we be made whole?\
10:33\
I testify that Jesus\
Christ paid the price\
10:35\
so that we can be made whole.\
10:37\
But we must choose to take that\
healing medicine He offers.\
10:40\
Take it today.\
10:42\
Do not delay.\
10:44\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
