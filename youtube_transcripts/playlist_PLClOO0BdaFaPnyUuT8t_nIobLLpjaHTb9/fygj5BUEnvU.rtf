Dear brothers and\
sisters, isn't it\
0:04\
marvelous to continue receiving\
revelation from heaven\
0:09\
through President Russell\
M. Nelson and our Church\
0:12\
leaders that invites us to\
live in new and holier ways,\
0:17\
at home and at church, with all\
our heart, mind, and strength?\
0:23\
Have you ever had\
opportunity to do something\
0:26\
for which you felt\
unprepared or inadequate\
0:29\
but were blessed for trying?\
0:32\
I have.\
0:33\
Here's one example.\
0:35\
Some years ago, Elder\
Richard G. Scott,\
0:37\
a member of the Quorum\
of the Twelve Apostles,\
0:39\
kindly invited,\
"Gerrit, would you\
0:42\
like to watercolor with me?"\
0:47\
Elder Scott said painting\
helped him observe and create.\
0:50\
He has written:\
"Attempt to be creative,\
0:54\
even if the results are modest.\
0:55\
...\
0:56\
Creativity can engender a\
spirit of gratitude for life\
1:00\
and for what the Lord has\
woven into your being. ...\
1:03\
If you choose wisely, it doesn't\
have to absorb a lot of time."\
1:10\
President Henry B. Eyring\
describes his artistic\
1:13\
meditations as motivated\
by "a feeling of love,"\
1:17\
including "the love of a\
Creator who expects His children\
1:22\
to become like Him--to\
create and to build."\
1:28\
President Eyring's\
creative works\
1:29\
provide a "unique,\
spiritual perspective\
1:32\
on testimony and faith."\
1:36\
President Boyd K.\
Packer's artwork\
1:38\
illustrates a fundamental\
gospel message:\
1:41\
"God is the Creator of\
the heavens and the earth\
1:44\
and all things that are in them,\
that all nature bears testimony\
1:49\
of that divinely\
directed creation,\
1:51\
and that there is [a] complete\
harmony between nature,\
1:54\
science, and the gospel\
of Jesus Christ."\
1:59\
Alma testifies, "All things\
denote there is a God."\
2:03\
Our Primary children sing,\
"Whenever I hear the song\
2:08\
of a bird or look at\
the blue, blue sky, ...\
2:12\
I'm glad that I live in this\
beautiful world Heav'nly Father\
2:16\
created for me."\
2:18\
Author Victor Hugo celebrates\
the "miraculous relationships\
2:24\
between beings and things;\
in this inexhaustible whole,\
2:27\
from sun to aphid. ...\
2:29\
All the birds that\
fly hold the thread\
2:32\
of eternity in their claws.\
2:34\
...\
2:34\
A nebula is an\
anthill of stars."\
2:38\
And that brings us back to\
Elder Scott's invitation.\
2:43\
"Elder Scott," I\
replied, "I would\
2:45\
like to become more\
observant and creative.\
2:48\
I thrill to imagine\
Heavenly Father paints\
2:51\
with billowing clouds and\
every hue of sky and water.\
2:55\
But"--here was a long pause--\
2:58\
"Elder Scott," I said, "I\
have no skill to watercolor.\
3:02\
I worry it may frustrate\
you to try and teach me."\
3:06\
Elder Scott smiled and\
arranged for us to meet.\
3:09\
On the appointed day, he\
prepared paper, paints,\
3:12\
and brushes.\
3:13\
He sketched some outlines and\
helped wet the paper for me.\
3:17\
We used as a model his\
beautiful watercolor\
3:20\
titled Campfire at Sunset.\
3:24\
As we painted, we talked about\
faith--how as we face the light\
3:29\
and warmth of a campfire,\
we leave the darkness\
3:33\
and uncertainty behind\
us--how on sometimes long,\
3:37\
lonely nights, our campfire\
of faith can give hope\
3:41\
and assurance.\
3:42\
And the dawn does come.\
3:44\
Our campfire of faith--our\
memories, experiences,\
3:49\
and heritage of faith in God's\
goodness and tender mercies\
3:53\
in our life--has strengthened\
us through the night.\
3:58\
My testimony is,\
for those who seek,\
4:00\
allow, live for it, the dawn\
of faith, sometimes gradually,\
4:06\
will come or can return.\
4:09\
The light will come when\
we desire and seek it,\
4:12\
when we are patient and\
obedient to God's commands, when\
4:16\
we are open to God's grace,\
healing, and covenants.\
4:22\
As we began painting,\
Elder Scott encouraged,\
4:24\
"Gerrit, even with one lesson\
you will paint something\
4:29\
you will want to\
keep and remember."\
4:32\
Elder Scott was right.\
4:33\
I treasure the watercolor of our\
campfire of faith Elder Scott\
4:38\
helped me paint.\
4:39\
My artistic ability was\
and remains limited,\
4:43\
but the remembrance of\
our campfire of faith\
4:46\
can encourage us in five ways.\
4:49\
First, our campfire of faith\
can encourage us to find joy\
4:55\
in wholesome creativity.\
4:57\
There is joy in imagining,\
learning, doing worthwhile\
5:01\
new things.\
5:02\
This is especially\
true as we deepen\
5:05\
faith and trust\
in Heavenly Father\
5:07\
and His Son, Jesus Christ.\
5:09\
We cannot love ourselves\
enough to save ourselves.\
5:12\
But Heavenly Father\
loves us more\
5:15\
and knows us better than\
we love or know ourselves.\
5:19\
We can trust the Lord and lean\
not unto our own understanding.\
5:25\
Have you ever been the\
only one not invited\
5:27\
to someone's birthday party?\
5:30\
Have you ever been chosen\
last, or not chosen,\
5:33\
when teams were selected?\
5:35\
Have you prepared for a\
school test, a job interview,\
5:38\
an opportunity you really\
wanted--and you felt you\
5:42\
failed?\
5:43\
Have you prayed\
for a relationship\
5:45\
that, for whatever reason,\
has not worked out?\
5:49\
Have you faced chronic illness,\
been abandoned by a spouse,\
5:54\
agonized for family?\
5:58\
Our Savior knows\
our circumstances.\
6:01\
As we exercise God-given agency\
and engage all our faculties\
6:06\
in humility and faith,\
our Savior Jesus Christ\
6:10\
can help us meet life's\
challenges and joys.\
6:14\
Faith includes a desire\
and choice to believe.\
6:18\
Faith also comes from obeying\
God's commandments, given\
6:22\
to bless us, as we\
follow His covenant path.\
6:26\
When we have felt, or feel,\
uncertain, alone, frustrated,\
6:30\
angry, let down, disappointed,\
or estranged from God\
6:34\
and His restored Church, it\
may take an extra measure\
6:38\
of effort and faith to enter\
again on His covenant path.\
6:42\
But it is worth it!\
6:44\
Please come, or come again,\
unto the Lord Jesus Christ!\
6:50\
God's love is stronger than\
the cords of death--temporal\
6:53\
or spiritual.\
6:55\
Our Savior's Atonement\
is infinite and eternal.\
6:59\
Each of us strays\
and falls short.\
7:02\
We may, for a\
time, lose our way.\
7:05\
God lovingly assures us,\
no matter where we are\
7:09\
or what we have done, there\
is no point of no return.\
7:14\
He waits ready to embrace us.\
7:18\
Second, our campfire of\
faith can encourage us\
7:21\
to minister in new, higher,\
and holier Spirit-filled ways.\
7:26\
Such brings miracles and\
the blessings of covenant\
7:29\
belonging--where we feel God's\
love and seek to minister\
7:32\
to others in that spirit.\
7:35\
Not long ago, Sister\
Gong and I became\
7:38\
acquainted with a father\
and family blessed\
7:41\
by a faithful priesthood\
brother who came to their bishop\
7:44\
and asked if he (the\
priesthood brother)\
7:47\
could be a home teaching\
companion with the father.\
7:50\
The father was not\
active and not interested\
7:53\
in home teaching.\
7:55\
But as the father's\
heart changed,\
7:58\
he and this loving\
priesthood brother\
8:00\
began visiting "their" families.\
8:03\
After one such visit, his\
wife--herself not then\
8:07\
attending Church--asked her\
husband how things had gone.\
8:11\
The father admitted, "I may have\
felt something"--and then he\
8:15\
went to the kitchen\
to get a beer.\
8:19\
But one thing followed\
another: tender experiences,\
8:23\
ministering service, changing\
hearts, temple preparation\
8:26\
class, coming to Church,\
being sealed as a family\
8:29\
in the holy temple.\
8:31\
Imagine how grateful the\
children and grandchildren\
8:35\
are to their father and\
mother and to the ministering\
8:38\
brother who came as a friend\
and companion with their father\
8:43\
to minister and love others.\
8:47\
A third campfire of\
faith encouragement:\
8:50\
gospel joy and\
blessings come when\
8:53\
we seek to love the\
Lord and others with all\
8:56\
our hearts and souls.\
8:59\
The scriptures\
invite us to place\
9:01\
all we are and are becoming on\
the altar of love and service.\
9:06\
In the Old Testament,\
Deuteronomy\
9:08\
enjoins us to "love the Lord thy\
God" with all our heart, soul,\
9:12\
and might.\
9:13\
Joshua exhorts, "Love\
the Lord your God, ...\
9:17\
walk in all his ways, ...\
keep his commandments, ...\
9:20\
cleave unto him, and ...\
serve him with all your heart\
9:23\
and with all your soul."\
9:26\
In the New Testament, our\
Savior states the two great\
9:29\
commandments: "Thou shalt love\
the Lord thy God with all thy\
9:32\
heart, and with all thy soul,\
and with all thy strength, ...\
9:37\
and thy neighbour as thyself."\
9:39\
In the Book of Mormon: Another\
Testament of Jesus Christ,\
9:42\
King Benjamin labored "with\
all the might of his body\
9:46\
and the faculty\
of his whole soul"\
9:49\
and established\
peace in the land.\
9:52\
In the Doctrine and Covenants,\
as every missionary knows,\
9:55\
the Lord asks us to serve Him\
with all our "heart, might,\
9:59\
mind and strength."\
10:01\
When the Saints\
entered Jackson County,\
10:03\
the Lord commanded them\
to keep the Sabbath holy\
10:06\
by loving "the Lord thy God\
with all thy heart, [and]\
10:10\
with all thy might,\
mind, and strength;\
10:12\
and in the name of Jesus\
Christ thou shalt serve him."\
10:17\
We rejoice in the invitation\
to devote our whole souls\
10:22\
to seeking higher\
and holier ways\
10:25\
to love God and those\
around us and to strengthen\
10:28\
our faith in Heavenly Father\
and Jesus Christ in our hearts\
10:32\
and in our homes and at Church.\
10:36\
Fourth, our campfire\
of faith encourages\
10:39\
us to establish regular\
patterns of righteous\
10:42\
living that deepen\
faith and spirituality.\
10:46\
These holy habits, righteous\
routines, or prayerful patterns\
10:50\
may include prayer;\
scripture study;\
10:52\
fasting; remembering\
our Savior and covenants\
10:55\
through the ordinance\
of the sacrament;\
10:57\
sharing gospel blessings through\
missionary, temple and family\
11:01\
history, and other\
service; keeping\
11:03\
a thoughtful personal\
journal; and so on.\
11:07\
When righteous patterns and\
spiritual yearnings join,\
11:11\
time and eternity come together.\
11:14\
Spiritual light\
and life come when\
11:16\
regular religious\
observance draws\
11:19\
us closer to our Heavenly Father\
and our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
11:23\
When we love the spirit\
and letter of the law,\
11:26\
the things of eternity\
can distill upon our souls\
11:30\
like the dews from heaven.\
11:31\
With daily obedience and\
refreshing living water,\
11:36\
we find answers,\
faith, and strength\
11:39\
to meet everyday challenges\
and opportunities with gospel\
11:42\
patience, perspective, and joy.\
11:46\
Fifth, as we keep the\
best of familiar patterns\
11:50\
while seeking new and holier\
ways to love God and help us\
11:54\
and others prepare to meet\
Him, our campfire of faith\
11:58\
can encourage us to remember\
perfection is in Christ, not\
12:02\
in ourselves or in the\
perfectionism of the world.\
12:06\
God's invitations are full\
of love and possibility\
12:10\
because Jesus Christ is "the\
way, the truth, and the life."\
12:15\
To those who feel burdened,\
He invites, "Come unto me,"\
12:19\
and to those who come\
to Him, He promises,\
12:23\
"I will give you rest."\
12:25\
"Come unto Christ, and\
be perfected in him, ...\
12:28\
love God with all your\
might, mind and strength,\
12:32\
then is his grace\
sufficient for you,\
12:35\
that by his grace ye may\
be perfect in Christ."\
12:39\
In this assurance, "by his grace\
ye may be perfect in Christ"\
12:44\
is also the comfort, peace, and\
promise we can continue forward\
12:49\
with faith and\
confidence in the Lord,\
12:51\
even when things do\
not go as we hope,\
12:55\
expect, or perhaps deserve,\
through no fault of our own,\
12:59\
even after we have\
done our best.\
13:02\
In various times\
and ways, we all\
13:04\
feel inadequate, uncertain,\
perhaps unworthy.\
13:08\
Yet in our faithful\
efforts to love God\
13:11\
and to minister to\
our neighbor, we\
13:14\
may feel God's love and\
needed inspiration for their\
13:18\
and our lives in\
new and holier ways.\
13:23\
With compassion, our Savior\
encourages and promises\
13:27\
we can "press forward with\
a steadfastness in Christ,\
13:31\
having a perfect brightness\
of hope, and a love of God\
13:34\
and of all men."\
13:36\
The doctrine of Christ,\
our Savior's Atonement,\
13:39\
and our whole-souled\
following of His covenant path\
13:43\
can help us know His\
truths and make us free.\
13:49\
I testify the\
fulness of His gospel\
13:52\
and His plan of happiness\
are restored and taught\
13:56\
in The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints,\
13:59\
in holy scripture,\
and by prophets\
14:02\
from the Prophet Joseph Smith\
to President Russell M. Nelson\
14:06\
today.\
14:07\
I testify His covenant path\
leads to the greatest gift\
14:12\
our loving Heavenly\
Father promises:\
14:14\
"Ye shall have eternal life."\
14:18\
May His blessings\
and enduring joy\
14:21\
be ours as we warm\
our hearts and hopes\
14:25\
and commitment at our\
campfire of faith,\
14:29\
I pray in the sacred and holy\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
