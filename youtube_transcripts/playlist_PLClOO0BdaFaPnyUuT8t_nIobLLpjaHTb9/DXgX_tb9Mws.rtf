The fictional character Mary\
Poppins is a typical English\
0:05\
nanny--who happens\
to be magical.\
0:08\
She blows in on the east wind\
to help the troubled Banks\
0:12\
family of Number 17, Cherry\
Tree Lane, in Edwardian London.\
0:17\
She is given charge of the\
children, Jane and Michael.\
0:21\
In a firm but kind\
manner, she begins\
0:24\
to teach them valuable lessons\
with an enchanting touch.\
0:29\
Jane and Michael make\
considerable progress,\
0:31\
but Mary decides that it\
is time for her to move on.\
0:35\
In the stage production, Mary's\
chimney sweep friend, Bert,\
0:40\
tries to dissuade\
her from leaving.\
0:43\
He argues, "But they're\
good kids, Mary."\
0:48\
Mary replies, "Would I be\
bothering with them if they\
0:51\
weren't?\
0:52\
But I can't help them\
if they won't let me,\
0:54\
and there's no one so hard\
to teach as the child who\
0:58\
knows everything."\
1:00\
Bert asks, "So?"\
1:03\
Mary answers, "So they've got to\
do the next bit on their own."\
1:09\
Brothers and sisters, like\
Jane and Michael Banks,\
1:13\
we are "good kids" who\
are worth bothering about.\
1:17\
Our Heavenly Father wants\
to help and bless us,\
1:21\
but we do not always let Him.\
1:23\
Sometimes we even act as if\
we already know everything.\
1:28\
And we too need to do\
"the next bit" on our own.\
1:33\
That is why we\
came to earth from\
1:36\
a premortal, heavenly home.\
1:38\
Our "bit" involves\
making choices.\
1:43\
Our Heavenly Father's\
goal in parenting\
1:46\
is not to have His\
children do what is right;\
1:49\
it is to have His children\
choose to do what is right\
1:55\
and ultimately become like Him.\
1:58\
If He simply wanted\
us to be obedient,\
2:01\
He would use immediate\
rewards and punishments\
2:04\
to influence our behaviors.\
2:07\
But God is not interested\
in His children\
2:10\
just becoming trained\
and obedient "pets"\
2:13\
who won't chew on His slippers\
in the celestial living room.\
2:20\
No, God wants His children\
to grow up spiritually\
2:24\
and join Him in the\
family business.\
2:28\
God established a plan\
whereby we can become heirs\
2:31\
in His kingdom, a\
covenant path that\
2:34\
leads us to become like Him,\
have the kind of life He has,\
2:38\
and live forever as\
families in His presence.\
2:42\
Personal choice was--and\
is--vital to this plan,\
2:47\
which we learned about in\
our premortal existence.\
2:50\
We accepted the plan and\
chose to come to earth.\
2:55\
To ensure that we would\
exercise faith and learn\
2:58\
to use our agency properly,\
a veil of forgetfulness\
3:02\
was drawn over our minds so we\
would not remember God's plan.\
3:07\
Without that veil,\
God's purposes\
3:11\
would not be achieved because\
we could not progress and become\
3:15\
the trusted inheritors\
He wants us to be.\
3:20\
The prophet Lehi said:\
"Wherefore, the Lord God\
3:24\
gave unto man that he\
should act for himself.\
3:27\
Wherefore, man could\
not act for himself\
3:31\
save it should be\
that he was enticed\
3:33\
by the one or the other."\
3:36\
At a fundamental\
level, one option\
3:40\
is represented by Jesus Christ,\
the Firstborn of the Father.\
3:44\
The other option is\
represented by Satan, Lucifer,\
3:49\
who wants to destroy\
agency and usurp power.\
3:53\
In Jesus Christ "we have an\
advocate with the Father."\
3:57\
After completing His\
atoning sacrifice,\
4:01\
Jesus "ascended into heaven\
... to claim of the Father his\
4:05\
rights of mercy which he hath\
upon the children of men."\
4:10\
And, having claimed\
the rights of mercy,\
4:13\
"he advocateth the cause\
of the children of men."\
4:18\
Christ's advocacy with\
the Father in our behalf\
4:21\
is not adversarial.\
4:23\
Jesus Christ, who\
allowed His will\
4:26\
to be swallowed up in\
the will of the Father,\
4:28\
would not champion\
anything other\
4:31\
than what the Father\
has wanted all along.\
4:33\
Heavenly Father\
undoubtedly cheers for\
4:36\
and applauds our successes.\
4:39\
Christ's advocacy\
is, at least in part,\
4:42\
to remind us that He\
has paid for our sins\
4:46\
and that no one is excluded\
from the reach of God's mercy.\
4:50\
For those who believe\
in Jesus Christ,\
4:53\
repent and are baptized, and\
endure to the end--a process\
4:59\
that leads to\
reconciliation--the Savior\
5:02\
forgives, heals, and advocates.\
5:06\
He is our helper, consoler,\
and intercessor--attesting\
5:10\
to and vouching for our\
reconciliation with God.\
5:16\
In stark contrast, Lucifer\
is an accuser or prosecutor.\
5:22\
John the Revelator described\
Lucifer's ultimate defeat:\
5:26\
"And I heard a loud voice\
saying in heaven, Now\
5:31\
is come salvation, and strength,\
and the kingdom of our God,\
5:35\
and the power of his Christ."\
5:38\
Why?\
5:39\
Because "the accuser of\
our brethren is cast down,\
5:44\
which accused them before\
our God day and night.\
5:47\
And they overcame him by\
the blood of the Lamb,\
5:51\
and by the word of\
their testimony."\
5:55\
Lucifer is this accuser.\
5:57\
He spoke against us in\
the premortal existence,\
6:00\
and he continues to\
denounce us in this life.\
6:03\
He seeks to drag us down.\
6:05\
He wants us to\
experience endless woe.\
6:08\
He is the one who tells\
us we are not adequate,\
6:11\
the one who tells us\
we are not good enough,\
6:13\
the one who tells us there is\
no recovery from a mistake.\
6:16\
He is the ultimate\
bully, the one\
6:19\
who kicks us when we are down.\
6:22\
If Lucifer were teaching a child\
to walk and the child stumbled,\
6:26\
he would scream at\
the child, punish him,\
6:29\
and tell him to quit trying.\
6:32\
Lucifer's ways\
bring discouragement\
6:35\
and despair--eventually\
and always.\
6:40\
This father of lies is\
the ultimate purveyor\
6:43\
of falsehood and cunningly works\
to deceive and distract us,\
6:48\
"for he seeketh that\
all men might be\
6:51\
miserable like unto himself."\
6:54\
If Christ were teaching a child\
to walk and the child stumbled,\
6:59\
He would help the child get up\
and encourage the next steps.\
7:03\
Christ is the\
helper and consoler.\
7:06\
His ways bring joy and\
hope--eventually and always.\
7:13\
God's plan includes\
directions for us,\
7:16\
referred to in the\
scriptures as commandments.\
7:19\
These commandments are neither\
a whimsical set nor an arbitrary\
7:24\
collection of imposed\
rules meant only\
7:26\
to train us to be obedient.\
7:28\
They are linked\
to our developing\
7:30\
the attributes of godliness,\
returning to our Heavenly\
7:34\
Father, and receiving\
enduring joy.\
7:37\
Obedience to His\
commandments is not blind;\
7:41\
we knowingly choose God\
and His pathway home.\
7:45\
The pattern for us is the same\
as it was for Adam and Eve,\
7:50\
wherein "God gave unto\
them commandments,\
7:53\
after having made known unto\
them the plan of redemption."\
7:57\
Though God wants us to\
be on the covenant path,\
8:01\
He gives us the\
dignity of choosing.\
8:05\
Indeed, God desires,\
expects, and directs\
8:08\
that each of His children\
choose for himself or herself.\
8:12\
He will not force us.\
8:14\
Through the gift of agency,\
God permits His children\
8:17\
to "to act for themselves\
and not to be acted upon."\
8:21\
Agency allows us to choose\
to get on the path, or not.\
8:27\
It allows us to get off, or not.\
8:30\
Just as we cannot\
be forced to obey,\
8:33\
we cannot be forced to disobey.\
8:36\
No one can, without\
our cooperation,\
8:39\
take us off the path.\
8:41\
Now, this is not to\
be confused with those\
8:44\
whose agency is violated.\
8:46\
They are not off the\
path; they are victims.\
8:48\
They receive God's\
understanding, love,\
8:51\
and compassion.\
8:53\
But when we get\
off the path, God\
8:55\
is saddened because He knows\
this eventually but invariably\
9:01\
leads to diminished happiness\
and forfeited blessings.\
9:05\
In the scriptures, getting off\
the path is referred to as sin,\
9:10\
and the resultant decrease\
in happiness and forfeited\
9:13\
blessings is called punishment.\
9:17\
In this sense, God\
is not punishing us;\
9:20\
punishment is a consequence\
of our own choices, not His.\
9:26\
When we discover that we are\
off the path, we can stay off,\
9:30\
or because of the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ,\
9:33\
we can choose to reverse\
our steps and get back on.\
9:37\
In the scriptures, the\
process of deciding\
9:40\
to change and return to the path\
is referred to as repentance.\
9:44\
Failure to repent\
means that we choose\
9:48\
to disqualify ourselves from the\
blessings God desires to give.\
9:53\
If we are "not willing to enjoy\
that which [we] might have\
9:56\
received," we will "return\
... to [our] own place,\
10:00\
to enjoy that which [we]\
are willing to receive"--our\
10:03\
choice, not God's.\
10:07\
No matter how long we\
have been off the path\
10:09\
or how far away we have\
wandered, the moment we decide\
10:13\
to change, God helps us return.\
10:16\
From God's perspective, through\
sincere repentance and pressing\
10:21\
forward with a steadfastness in\
Christ, once back on the path,\
10:26\
it will be as if\
we were never off.\
10:30\
The Savior pays for\
our sins and frees us\
10:33\
from the looming decrease\
in happiness and blessings.\
10:37\
This is referred to in the\
scriptures as forgiveness.\
10:41\
After baptism, all members slip\
off the path--some of us even\
10:47\
dive off.\
10:48\
Therefore, exercising\
faith in Jesus Christ,\
10:52\
repenting, receiving help\
from Him, and being forgiven\
10:56\
are not onetime events but\
lifelong processes, processes\
11:02\
that are repetitive\
and iterative.\
11:05\
This is how we\
"endure to the end."\
11:09\
We need to choose\
whom we will serve.\
11:11\
The magnitude of our\
eternal blessings\
11:14\
depends on choosing\
the living God\
11:16\
and joining Him in His work.\
11:19\
As we strive to "do the\
next bit" on our own,\
11:23\
we practice using\
our agency correctly.\
11:27\
As two former Relief Society\
General Presidents said,\
11:31\
we should not be "babies that\
need petting and correction all\
11:34\
the time."\
11:36\
No, God wants us to\
become mature adults who\
11:40\
govern ourselves.\
11:43\
Choosing to follow\
the Father's plan\
11:45\
is the only way we can become\
inheritors in His kingdom;\
11:50\
only then can He\
trust us to not even\
11:53\
ask for that which is\
contrary to His will.\
11:56\
But we need to\
remember that "there's\
11:58\
no one so hard to teach as the\
child who knows everything."\
12:02\
So we need to be willing to\
be tutored in the Lord's way\
12:06\
by the Lord and His servants.\
12:09\
We can trust that we are beloved\
children of Heavenly Parents\
12:13\
and worth "bothering about" and\
be assured that "on our own"\
12:18\
will never mean "alone."\
12:22\
As the Book of Mormon prophet\
Jacob said, I say with him:\
12:27\
"Therefore, cheer\
up your hearts,\
12:30\
and remember that ye are free\
to act for yourselves--to choose\
12:34\
the way of everlasting death\
or the way of eternal life.\
12:39\
"Wherefore, my beloved\
brethren [and sisters],\
12:41\
reconcile yourselves\
to the will of God,\
12:44\
and not to the will of the\
devil ...; and remember,\
12:47\
after ye are\
reconciled unto God,\
12:50\
that it is only in and through\
the grace of God that ye are\
12:53\
saved."\
12:55\
So choose faith in\
Christ; choose repentance;\
12:59\
choose to be baptized and\
receive the Holy Ghost;\
13:02\
choose to conscientiously\
prepare for\
13:05\
and worthily partake\
of the sacrament;\
13:07\
choose to make\
covenants in the temple;\
13:09\
and choose to serve the\
living God and His children.\
13:14\
Our choices determine who we\
are and who we will become.\
13:20\
I conclude with the rest of\
Jacob's blessing: "Wherefore,\
13:25\
may God raise you from ...\
everlasting death by the power\
13:28\
of the atonement, that ye may\
be received into the eternal\
13:32\
kingdom of God."\
13:33\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
