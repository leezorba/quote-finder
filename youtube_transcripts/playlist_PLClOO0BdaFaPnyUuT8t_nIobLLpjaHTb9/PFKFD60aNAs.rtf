President Ballard, we\
love you, and we are\
0:03\
praying for your dear family.\
0:06\
A year ago, a Primary\
child I met in Chile\
0:10\
brought a smile to my face.\
0:12\
"Hello," he said, "I am David.\
0:15\
Will you talk about me\
in general conference?"\
0:20\
In quiet moments,\
however, I have pondered\
0:23\
David's unexpected greeting.\
0:25\
We all want to be recognized.\
0:28\
We want to matter, to be\
remembered, and to feel loved.\
0:32\
Sisters and brothers,\
each of you matter.\
0:36\
Even if you are not spoken\
of in general conference,\
0:39\
the Savior knows\
you and loves you.\
0:43\
If you wonder if\
that is true, you\
0:45\
need only contemplate\
that He has "graven [you]\
0:49\
upon the palms of [His] hands."\
0:51\
Knowing that the\
Savior loves us,\
0:54\
we might then wonder, how can\
we best show our love for Him?\
0:59\
The Savior asks Peter,\
"Lovest thou me ...?"\
1:04\
Peter answered, "Yea,\
Lord; thou knowest ...\
1:07\
I love thee.\
1:08\
He saith unto him,\
Feed my lambs."\
1:14\
When asked this question\
both a second and third time,\
1:17\
"Lovest thou me?"\
1:20\
Peter was grieved yet confirmed\
his love: "Lord, thou knowest\
1:26\
all things; thou knowest\
that I love thee.\
1:29\
Jesus saith unto\
him, Feed my sheep."\
1:35\
Hadn't Peter already\
proven himself\
1:37\
a loving follower of Christ?\
1:39\
From their first\
encounter on the seashore,\
1:42\
he "straightway"\
left his fishing\
1:44\
nets to follow the Savior.\
1:45\
Peter became a\
true fisher of men;\
1:49\
he accompanied the Savior\
during His personal ministry\
1:52\
and helped teach to others\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
1:56\
But now the\
resurrected Lord knew\
1:59\
He would no longer\
be by Peter's side,\
2:01\
showing him how and\
when he should serve.\
2:04\
In the Savior's\
absence, Peter would\
2:07\
need to seek guidance\
from the Spirit,\
2:10\
receive revelation on\
his own, and then have\
2:14\
the courage and faith to act.\
2:17\
Focused on His sheep,\
the Savior desired\
2:20\
Peter to do what He\
would do if He was there.\
2:23\
He asked Peter to\
become a shepherd.\
2:28\
Last April, President\
Russell M. Nelson\
2:30\
extended a similar\
invitation to us\
2:33\
to feed our Father's\
sheep in a holier way\
2:36\
and to do so\
through ministering.\
2:39\
To effectively accept\
this invitation,\
2:41\
we must develop a\
shepherd's heart\
2:44\
and understand the needs\
of the Lord's sheep.\
2:47\
So how do we become\
the shepherds\
2:50\
the Lord needs us to become?\
2:53\
As with all questions, we\
can look to our Savior,\
2:56\
Jesus Christ--the Good Shepherd.\
2:59\
The Savior's sheep were\
known and numbered,\
3:03\
they were watched\
over, and they were\
3:05\
gathered into the fold of God.\
3:08\
As we strive to follow\
the Savior's example,\
3:10\
we must first know\
and number His sheep.\
3:14\
We have been assigned specific\
individuals and families\
3:18\
to tend so we are certain\
that all the Lord's flocks are\
3:21\
accounted for and no\
one--no one is forgotten.\
3:27\
Numbering, however, is\
not really about numbers;\
3:30\
it is about making\
certain each person feels\
3:34\
the love of the Savior through\
someone who serves for Him.\
3:38\
In that way, all can\
recognize they are known\
3:41\
by a loving Father in Heaven.\
3:44\
I recently met a\
young woman who has\
3:46\
been assigned to minister to\
a sister almost five times\
3:50\
her age.\
3:51\
Together, they have discovered\
a common love for music.\
3:54\
When this young woman visits,\
they sing songs together\
3:58\
and they share their favorites.\
4:00\
They are forging\
a friendship that\
4:02\
blesses both of their lives.\
4:05\
I hope those to whom you\
minister will see you\
4:08\
as a friend and\
realize that in you,\
4:11\
they have a champion and a\
confidant--someone who is aware\
4:15\
of their circumstances and\
supports them in their hopes\
4:18\
and aspirations.\
4:20\
Recently I received an\
assignment to minister\
4:23\
to a sister neither my\
companion nor I knew well.\
4:27\
As I counseled with Jess,\
my 16-year-old ministering\
4:30\
companion, she wisely suggested,\
"We need to get to know her."\
4:37\
Well, we immediately\
decided that a selfie\
4:40\
and an introductory\
text were in order.\
4:42\
I held the phone, and\
Jess pushed the button\
4:45\
to take the photo.\
4:47\
Our first ministering\
opportunity\
4:49\
was a companionship effort.\
4:51\
On our first visit,\
we asked our sister\
4:54\
if there was anything we\
could include in our prayers\
4:58\
on her behalf.\
4:59\
She shared a tender\
personal challenge\
5:04\
and said she would welcome,\
so welcome our prayers.\
5:08\
Her honesty and confidence\
brought an instant bond\
5:11\
of love.\
5:13\
What a sweet privilege\
to remember her\
5:16\
in my daily prayers.\
5:17\
As you pray, you will feel\
the love of Jesus Christ\
5:21\
for those to whom you minister.\
5:23\
Share that love with them.\
5:26\
What better way is there to\
feed His sheep than to help them\
5:30\
feel His love--through you?\
5:33\
A second way to develop\
the heart of a shepherd\
5:36\
is to watch over His sheep.\
5:38\
As members of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
5:41\
Saints, we can move,\
fix, repair, and rebuild\
5:45\
just about anything.\
5:47\
We are quick to meet\
a need with a helping\
5:49\
hand or a plate of cookies.\
5:52\
But is there more?\
5:55\
Do our sheep know we are\
watching over them with love\
5:58\
and we will take action to help?\
6:02\
IN MATTHEW WE READ: "Come,\
ye blessed of my Father,\
6:05\
inherit the kingdom\
prepared for you ...:\
6:09\
"For I was an hungred, and ye\
gave me meat: I was thirsty,\
6:12\
and ye gave me drink:\
I was a stranger,\
6:15\
and ye took me in. ...\
6:18\
"Then shall the righteous answer\
him, saying, Lord, when saw we\
6:22\
thee an hungred, and\
fed thee? or thirsty,\
6:24\
and gave thee drink?\
6:26\
"When saw we thee a\
stranger, and took thee in?"\
6:30\
Brothers and sisters,\
the key word is saw.\
6:33\
The righteous saw those\
in need because they\
6:37\
were watching and noticing.\
6:40\
We too can be a watchful\
eye to aid and comfort,\
6:44\
to celebrate and even dream.\
6:48\
As we act, we can be assured\
of the promise in Matthew:\
6:52\
"Inasmuch as ye have done it\
unto one of the least of these\
6:56\
..., ye have done it unto me."\
6:59\
A friend--we will call him\
John--shared what can happen\
7:03\
when we see another's\
less-visible need:\
7:06\
"A sister in my ward\
attempted suicide.\
7:11\
After two months, I\
discovered no one in my quorum\
7:15\
had approached her\
husband to address\
7:17\
this traumatic experience.\
7:19\
Sadly, I had not acted either.\
7:22\
Finally, I asked the\
husband to lunch.\
7:24\
He was a shy man,\
often reserved.\
7:27\
And yet when I said, 'Your\
wife attempted suicide.\
7:32\
That must be\
overwhelming for you.\
7:35\
Do you want to talk about it?'\
7:38\
he openly wept.\
7:40\
We had a tender and\
intimate conversation\
7:43\
and developed a remarkable\
closeness and trust\
7:46\
within minutes."\
7:48\
John added, "I think\
our tendency is just\
7:51\
to bring brownies\
rather than figure out\
7:53\
how to walk into [the] moment\
with honesty and love."\
7:58\
Our sheep may be hurting,\
lost, or even willfully astray;\
8:02\
as their shepherd, we\
can be among the first\
8:05\
to see their need.\
8:07\
We can listen and love without\
judgment and offer hope\
8:10\
and help with the discerning\
guidance of the Holy Ghost.\
8:14\
Sisters and brothers, the world\
is more hope-filled and joyful\
8:19\
because of the inspired acts\
of kindness you perform.\
8:23\
As you seek the Lord's direction\
on how to convey His love\
8:27\
and see the needs of those\
to whom you minister,\
8:30\
your eyes will be opened.\
8:33\
Your sacred\
ministering assignment\
8:35\
gives you a divine\
right to inspiration.\
8:38\
You can seek that\
inspiration with confidence.\
8:43\
Third, we want our sheep to be\
gathered into the fold of God.\
8:48\
To do so, we must consider where\
they are on the covenant path\
8:52\
and be willing to walk with\
them on their journey of faith.\
8:57\
Ours is a sacred privilege\
to come to know their hearts\
9:02\
and point them to their Savior.\
9:06\
Sister Josivini in Fiji had\
difficulty seeing her way\
9:11\
forward on the covenant\
path--literally.\
9:15\
Her friend saw that\
Josivini struggled\
9:18\
to see the scriptures\
well enough to read.\
9:21\
She provided Josivini\
with new reading glasses\
9:26\
and a bright yellow\
pencil to highlight\
9:29\
every mention of Jesus\
Christ in the Book of Mormon.\
9:32\
What started as a simple desire\
to minister and to help with\
9:36\
scripture study has resulted in\
Josivini attending the temple\
9:42\
for the first time--28 years\
after she was baptized.\
9:49\
Whether our sheep\
are strong or weak,\
9:52\
rejoicing or in anguish,\
we can make certain\
9:56\
that no one walks alone.\
9:59\
We can love them wherever\
they are spiritually\
10:02\
and offer support and\
encouragement for the next step\
10:05\
forward.\
10:06\
As we pray and seek to\
understand their hearts,\
10:10\
I testify that Heavenly\
Father will direct us\
10:14\
and His Spirit will go with us.\
10:18\
We have the opportunity to be\
the "angels round about" them\
10:24\
as He goes before their face.\
10:29\
The Lord invites us\
to feed His sheep.\
10:35\
To tend His flocks\
as He would, He\
10:38\
invites us to be shepherds to\
every nation, every country;\
10:44\
and yes, Elder Uchtdorf, we\
love and need German shepherds.\
10:50\
And He desires His young\
people to join in the cause.\
10:56\
Our youth can be some of\
the strongest shepherds.\
10:59\
They are, as President Russell\
M. Nelson said, "among the best\
11:03\
the Lord has ever\
sent to this world."\
11:06\
They are "noble spirits,"\
our "finest players"\
11:10\
who follow the Savior.\
11:12\
Can you imagine the power\
such shepherds will bring\
11:16\
as they care for His sheep?\
11:20\
Ministering side by side with\
these youth, we see wonders.\
11:26\
Young women and young\
men, we need you.\
11:30\
If you don't have a\
ministering assignment,\
11:33\
talk with your Relief Society\
or elders quorum president.\
11:37\
They will rejoice\
in your willingness\
11:39\
to make certain His sheep are\
known and numbered, watched\
11:44\
over, and gathered\
into the fold of God.\
11:49\
When the day comes\
that we will kneel\
11:52\
at the feet of our\
beloved Savior,\
11:55\
having nourished\
His flock, I pray\
11:59\
we can answer as did Peter:\
"Yea, Lord; thou knowest\
12:05\
that I love thee."\
12:06\
These, Thy sheep, are\
loved, they are safe,\
12:12\
and they are home.\
12:15\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
