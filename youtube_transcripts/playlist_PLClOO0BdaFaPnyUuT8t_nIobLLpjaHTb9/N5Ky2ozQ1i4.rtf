Modern revelation defines\
truth as a "knowledge of things\
0:05\
as they are, as they were,\
and as they are to come."\
0:10\
That is a perfect\
definition for the plan\
0:13\
of salvation and "The Family:\
A Proclamation to the World."\
0:19\
We live in a time of greatly\
expanded and disseminated\
0:22\
information.\
0:24\
But not all this\
information is true.\
0:27\
We need to be cautious\
as we seek truth\
0:31\
and choose sources\
for that search.\
0:35\
We should not consider secular\
prominence or authority\
0:40\
as qualified sources of truth.\
0:43\
We should be cautious\
about relying\
0:45\
on information or advice\
offered by entertainment\
0:48\
stars, prominent athletes, or\
anonymous internet sources.\
0:54\
Expertise in one\
field should not\
0:57\
be taken as expertise on\
truth in other subjects.\
1:03\
We should also be cautious about\
the motivation of the one who\
1:07\
provides information.\
1:09\
That is why the scriptures\
warn us against priestcraft.\
1:14\
If the source is\
anonymous or unknown,\
1:18\
the information may\
also be suspect.\
1:22\
Our personal decisions should\
be based on information\
1:26\
from sources that are qualified\
on the subject and free\
1:31\
from selfish motivations.\
1:35\
When we seek the\
truth about religion,\
1:38\
we should use spiritual methods\
appropriate for that search:\
1:43\
prayer, the witness\
of the Holy Ghost,\
1:46\
and study of the scriptures and\
the words of modern prophets.\
1:51\
I am always sad\
when I hear of one\
1:54\
who reports a loss of religious\
faith because of secular\
1:58\
teachings.\
2:00\
Those who once had\
spiritual vision\
2:03\
can suffer from self-inflicted\
spiritual blindness.\
2:07\
As President Henry\
B. Eyring said,\
2:10\
"Their problem does not lie\
in what they think they see;\
2:14\
it lies in what\
they cannot see."\
2:19\
The methods of science\
lead us to what\
2:22\
we call scientific truth.\
2:24\
But "scientific truth"\
is not the whole of life.\
2:28\
Those who do not learn "by\
study and also by faith"\
2:34\
limit their\
understanding of truth\
2:36\
to what they can verify\
by scientific means.\
2:40\
That puts artificial limits\
on their pursuit of truth.\
2:44\
President James E. Faust said:\
"Those who have been [baptized]\
2:49\
put their eternal souls at risk\
by carelessly pursuing only\
2:54\
the secular source of learning.\
2:58\
We believe that The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
3:02\
Saints has the fulness of\
the gospel of Christ, which\
3:06\
gospel is the essence of truth\
and eternal enlightenment."\
3:14\
We find true and enduring\
joy by coming to know\
3:18\
and acting upon the\
truth about who we\
3:21\
are, the meaning of\
mortal life, and where\
3:25\
we are going when we die.\
3:27\
Those truths cannot be learned\
by scientific or secular\
3:32\
methods.\
3:35\
I will now speak of\
restored gospel truths that\
3:40\
are fundamental to the\
doctrine of The Church of Jesus\
3:43\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
3:45\
Please consider these\
truths carefully.\
3:48\
They explain much about our\
doctrine and practices, perhaps\
3:53\
including some things\
not yet understood.\
3:58\
There is a God,\
who is the loving\
4:01\
Father of the spirits of all who\
have ever lived or will live.\
4:07\
Gender is eternal.\
4:09\
Before we were\
born on this earth,\
4:12\
we all lived as male and female\
spirits in the presence of God.\
4:19\
We have just heard\
the Tabernacle\
4:21\
Choir at Temple Square sing\
"I Will Follow God's Plan."\
4:27\
That is the plan\
God established so\
4:30\
that all of His spirit children\
could progress eternally.\
4:35\
That plan is vital\
to each of us.\
4:39\
Under that plan, God created\
this earth as a place\
4:43\
where His beloved\
spirit children\
4:45\
could be born into mortality\
to receive a physical body\
4:50\
and to have the opportunity\
for eternal progress\
4:54\
by making righteous choices.\
4:58\
To be meaningful,\
mortal choices had\
5:01\
to be made between contesting\
forces of good and evil.\
5:06\
There had to be opposition,\
and therefore an adversary,\
5:11\
who was cast out\
because of rebellion,\
5:15\
was allowed to\
tempt God's children\
5:17\
to act contrary to God's plan.\
5:22\
The purpose of God's plan\
was to give His children\
5:25\
the opportunity to\
choose eternal life.\
5:28\
This could only be accomplished\
by experience in mortality\
5:34\
and, after death, by postmortal\
growth in the spirit world.\
5:42\
In the course of mortal\
life, we would all\
5:44\
be soiled by sin as we yielded\
to the evil temptations\
5:49\
of the adversary, and\
we would eventually die.\
5:53\
We accepted those\
challenges in reliance\
5:57\
upon the plan's assurance\
that God our Father\
6:01\
would provide a Savior,\
His Only Begotten\
6:04\
Son, who would rescue us\
by a universal resurrection\
6:09\
to an embodied life after death.\
6:13\
The Savior would also\
provide an atonement\
6:17\
to pay the price for\
all to be cleansed\
6:20\
from sin on the\
conditions He prescribed.\
6:24\
Those conditions included faith\
in Christ, repentance, baptism,\
6:30\
the gift of the Holy Ghost,\
and other ordinances performed\
6:34\
by priesthood authority.\
6:37\
God's great plan of happiness\
provides a perfect balance\
6:41\
between eternal\
justice and the mercy\
6:45\
we can obtain through the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
6:49\
It also enables us\
to be transformed\
6:52\
into new creatures in Christ.\
6:57\
A loving God reaches\
out to each of us.\
7:01\
We know that through His love\
and because of the Atonement\
7:06\
of His Only Begotten\
Son, "all mankind\
7:10\
may be saved, by obedience\
to the laws and ordinances\
7:15\
of [His] gospel."\
7:18\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints\
7:21\
is properly known as a\
family-centered Church.\
7:25\
But what is not\
well understood is\
7:28\
that our family-centeredness\
is focused on more than mortal\
7:32\
relationships.\
7:34\
Eternal relationships are also\
fundamental to our theology.\
7:39\
"The family is ordained of God."\
7:43\
Under the great plan\
of our loving Creator,\
7:47\
the mission of His\
restored Church\
7:49\
is to help the children of God\
achieve the supernal blessing\
7:54\
of exaltation in the celestial\
kingdom, which can only\
7:59\
be attained through\
an eternal marriage\
8:02\
between a man and a woman.\
8:05\
We affirm the Lord's\
teachings that "gender\
8:08\
is an essential characteristic\
of individual premortal,\
8:13\
mortal, and eternal\
identity and purpose"\
8:17\
and that "marriage\
between man and woman\
8:20\
is essential to\
His eternal plan."\
8:25\
Finally, God's love is so great\
that, except for the few who\
8:30\
deliberately become\
sons of perdition,\
8:33\
He has provided a destiny of\
glory for all of His children.\
8:39\
"All of His children"\
includes all who are dead.\
8:43\
We perform ordinances for\
them by proxy in our temples.\
8:49\
The purpose of the\
Church of Jesus Christ\
8:53\
is to qualify His\
children for the highest\
8:56\
degree of glory, which is\
exaltation or eternal life.\
9:01\
For those who do not\
desire or qualify for that,\
9:06\
God has provided other, though\
lesser, kingdoms of glory.\
9:14\
Anyone who understands these\
eternal truths can understand\
9:17\
why we members of The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
9:21\
Saints think as we\
do and do as we do.\
9:28\
I will now mention\
some applications\
9:30\
of these eternal truths,\
which can only be understood\
9:33\
in light of God's plan.\
9:35\
First, we honor\
individual agency.\
9:39\
Most are aware of the restored\
Church's great efforts\
9:43\
to promote religious\
freedom in the United States\
9:46\
and across the world.\
9:48\
These efforts do not promote\
just our own interests\
9:52\
but, according to His plan, seek\
to help all of God's children\
9:57\
enjoy freedom to choose.\
10:00\
Second, we are a\
missionary people.\
10:03\
We are sometimes asked\
why we send missionaries\
10:06\
to so many nations, even\
among Christian populations.\
10:10\
We receive the same\
question about why\
10:13\
we give many millions of\
dollars of humanitarian aid\
10:17\
to persons who are not\
members of our Church\
10:20\
and why we do not link this\
aid to our missionary efforts.\
10:24\
We do this because we esteem all\
mortals as children of God--our\
10:30\
brothers and sisters--and we\
want to share our spiritual\
10:36\
and temporal abundance\
with everyone.\
10:40\
Third, mortal life\
is sacred to us.\
10:44\
Our commitment to\
God's plan requires\
10:46\
us to oppose abortion\
and euthanasia.\
10:52\
Fourth, some are troubled by\
some of our Church's positions\
10:56\
on marriage and children.\
10:58\
Our knowledge of God's\
revealed plan of salvation\
11:02\
requires us to oppose current\
social and legal pressures\
11:07\
to retreat from\
traditional marriage\
11:10\
or to make changes that confuse\
or alter gender or homogenize\
11:16\
the differences\
between men and women.\
11:18\
We know that the\
relationships, identities,\
11:22\
and functions of men and women\
are essential to accomplish\
11:27\
God's great plan.\
11:30\
Fifth, we also have a\
distinctive perspective\
11:33\
on children.\
11:34\
We look on the bearing\
and nurturing of children\
11:37\
as part of God's plan and\
a joyful and sacred duty\
11:41\
of those given the power\
to participate in it.\
11:45\
In our view, the\
ultimate treasures\
11:48\
on earth and in heaven are our\
children and our posterity.\
11:53\
Therefore, we must teach\
and contend for principles\
11:57\
and practices that provide\
the best conditions\
12:00\
for the development and\
happiness of children--all\
12:03\
children.\
12:06\
Finally, we are beloved children\
of a Heavenly Father, who\
12:10\
has taught us that maleness\
and femaleness, marriage\
12:14\
between a man and a\
woman, and the bearing\
12:17\
and nurturing of\
children are all\
12:19\
essential to His great\
plan of happiness.\
12:22\
Our positions on\
these fundamentals\
12:25\
frequently provoke\
opposition to the Church.\
12:28\
We consider that inevitable.\
12:31\
Opposition is part of the plan,\
and Satan's most strenuous\
12:36\
opposition is directed\
at whatever is\
12:38\
most important to God's plan.\
12:41\
He seeks to destroy God's work.\
12:44\
His prime methods\
are to discredit\
12:46\
the Savior and His\
divine authority,\
12:49\
to erase the effects of the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ,\
12:53\
to discourage repentance,\
to counterfeit revelation,\
12:58\
and to contradict\
individual accountability.\
13:02\
He also seeks to confuse\
gender, to distort marriage,\
13:06\
and to discourage\
childbearing--especially\
13:09\
by parents who will\
raise children in truth.\
13:14\
The work of the Lord\
is going forward\
13:16\
despite the organized and\
constant opposition that\
13:20\
confronts us as we\
strive to practice\
13:23\
the teachings of The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
13:26\
Saints.\
13:27\
For those who falter\
under that opposition,\
13:30\
I offer these suggestions.\
13:33\
Remember the principle of\
repentance made possible\
13:36\
by the power and\
Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
13:40\
As Elder Neal A.\
Maxwell urged, don't\
13:43\
be among those "who\
would rather try\
13:45\
to change the Church than\
to change themselves."\
13:49\
As Elder Jeffrey\
R. Holland urged:\
13:51\
"Hold fast to what you already\
know and stand strong until\
13:56\
additional knowledge comes. ...\
13:57\
"...\
13:58\
In this Church, what\
we know will always\
14:00\
trump what we do not know."\
14:04\
Exercise faith in the\
Lord Jesus Christ,\
14:07\
which is the first\
principle of the gospel.\
14:11\
Finally, seek help.\
14:12\
Our Church leaders love you\
and seek spiritual guidance\
14:16\
to help you.\
14:17\
We provide many\
resources such as you\
14:20\
will find through LDS.org\
and other supports\
14:24\
for gospel study in the home.\
14:26\
We also have ministering\
brothers and sisters called\
14:30\
to give loving assistance.\
14:34\
Our loving Heavenly\
Father wants His children\
14:36\
to have the joy that is the\
purpose of our creation.\
14:40\
That joyful destiny\
is eternal life,\
14:44\
which we can obtain\
by pressing forward\
14:47\
along what our prophet,\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
14:50\
often calls "the covenant path."\
14:53\
Here is what he said\
in his first message\
14:56\
as President of the Church:\
"Keep on the covenant path.\
15:01\
Your commitment to\
follow the Savior\
15:03\
by making covenants with Him\
and then keeping those covenants\
15:07\
will open the door to\
every spiritual blessing\
15:10\
and privilege available to\
men, women, and children\
15:13\
everywhere."\
15:17\
I solemnly testify that the\
things I have said are true,\
15:21\
and they are made possible by\
the teachings and the Atonement\
15:26\
of Jesus Christ,\
who makes it all\
15:29\
possible under the great plan\
of God, our Eternal Father.\
15:33\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
