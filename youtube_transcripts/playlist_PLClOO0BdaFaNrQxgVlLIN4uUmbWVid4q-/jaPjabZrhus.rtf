While on a business trip\
several years ago,\
0:04\
I found myself seated next to\
a man from the Netherlands.\
0:08\
I was eager to visit with him since\
I had served in Belgium and\
0:11\
the Netherlands as a young missionary.\
0:14\
As we became acquainted, he gave\
me his business card with\
0:18\
the unique job title of “Professor\
of Happiness.”\
0:22\
I commented on his amazing profession\
and asked him what\
0:25\
a professor of happiness did.\
0:27\
He said he taught people how to have\
0:29\
a happy life by establishing meaningful\
relationships and goals.\
0:33\
I replied, “That’s wonderful.\
0:34\
But what if you could also teach how\
those relationships can continue beyond\
0:38\
the grave and answer other\
questions of the soul,\
0:41\
such as what is the purpose of life?\
0:43\
how can we overcome our weaknesses?\
and where do we go after we die?”\
0:48\
He admitted that it would be amazing if\
we had the answers to those questions,\
0:52\
and I was pleased to share\
with him that we do.\
0:55\
Today I would like to review\
a few essential principles\
0:58\
for true happiness that seem to elude\
1:00\
so many in this confusing world where\
many things are interesting,\
1:04\
but few are truly important. Alma\
taught the people of his day,\
1:09\
“For behold, I say unto you, there be\
many things to come; and behold,\
1:12\
there is one thing which is of more\
importance than they all—\
1:15\
for behold, the time is not far distant\
that the Redeemer liveth\
1:19\
and cometh among his people.”\
1:21\
This declaration is equally important\
to us today as we anticipate\
1:26\
and prepare for Christ's Second Coming.\
1:29\
Therefore, my first observation\
is that building upon\
1:31\
the foundation of Jesus Christ is\
essential to our happiness.\
1:35\
This is “a sure foundation,\
1:37\
a foundation whereon if men build,\
they cannot fall.”\
1:42\
Doing so prepares us for the challenges\
of life, come what may.\
1:46\
Many years ago, I went to a summer\
scout camp with our son Justin.\
1:49\
As the activities got underway,\
1:51\
he excitedly announced that he and\
his friends wanted to earn\
1:54\
the archery merit badge. Doing\
so required the boys to pass\
1:58\
a short written test and hit a target\
with their arrows. My heart sank.\
2:03\
At the time, Justin was quite frail\
due to cystic fibrosis,\
2:07\
a disease he had been battling\
since birth.\
2:10\
I wondered if he could pull the bow back\
far enough to send the arrow to\
2:13\
the target. As he and his friends\
left for the archery class,\
2:17\
I silently prayed that he would not\
be humiliated by the experience.\
2:23\
A couple of anxious hours later,\
2:24\
I saw him coming up the path toward me\
with a big smile. “Dad,” he exclaimed.\
2:28\
“I got the merit badge!\
I got a bull’s eye!\
2:31\
It was on the target next to mine,\
but I hit a bull’s eye!”\
2:37\
He had pulled the bow back with all\
his might and let the arrow fly,\
2:41\
unable to control its trajectory. How\
grateful I am for that understanding\
2:46\
archery instructor who never\
said, “Sorry, wrong target.”\
2:51\
Rather, upon seeing Justin's obvious\
limitations and earnest effort,\
2:55\
he kindly responded, “Good job.”\
3:00\
That is how it will be for us if we\
do our very best to follow Christ\
3:03\
and His prophets in spite\
of our limitations.\
3:06\
If we come unto Him by keeping our\
covenants and repenting of our sins,\
3:10\
we will joyfully hear our\
Savior’s commendation:\
3:13\
“Well done, thou good and\
faithful servant.”\
3:16\
I bear you my witness of the divinity\
of the Savior of the world,\
3:19\
and of His redemptive love\
and power to heal,\
3:21\
strengthen, and lift us when we are\
earnestly striving to come unto Him.\
3:26\
Conversely, there is no way we can move\
with the crowd and also toward Jesus.\
3:32\
The Savior has defeated death,\
3:34\
disease, and sin, and has provided a way\
3:36\
for our our ultimate perfection if we\
will follow Him with all of our hearts.\
3:42\
My second observation is that it is\
crucial to our happiness that we\
3:45\
remember that we are sons and\
daughters of a loving\
3:47\
Heavenly Father. Knowing and trusting\
this reality changes everything.\
3:53\
Several years ago on a flight home\
from a Church assignment,\
3:56\
Sister Sabin and I found ourselves\
seated directly behind\
3:58\
a very large man who had a big\
angry face tattooed on\
4:02\
the back of his bald head, as\
well as the number 439.\
4:08\
When we landed, I said, “Excuse me, sir,\
4:10\
do you mind if I ask the significance\
of the number tattooed on\
4:14\
the back of your head?” I didn’t\
dare ask about the angry face.\
4:19\
He said, “That’s me. That’s who I am.\
I own that territory. 219.”\
4:26\
439 was the actual number on his head,\
so I was surprised he got it wrong\
4:30\
since it was so important to him.\
4:33\
I thought how sad it was that\
this man's identity\
4:37\
and self-esteem were based on a number\
associated with a gang territory.\
4:42\
I thought to myself, “This tough-looking\
man was once somebody’s little boy,\
4:47\
who still needed to feel\
valued and to belong.\
4:51\
If only he knew who he really was\
and to whom he really belonged,\
4:55\
for we have all been bought\
with a price.”\
4:58\
There is a wise line in the song from\
5:00\
the film “The Prince of Egypt” that\
states, “Look at your life through\
5:05\
heaven’s eyes.” As the knowledge\
of our divine lineage\
5:08\
and eternal potential sinks\
deep into our souls,\
5:11\
we will be able to view\
life as a purposeful,\
5:13\
unfolding adventure to\
learn and grow from,\
5:16\
even as we “see through a glass\
darkly” for a short season.\
5:21\
The third hallmark for happiness is to\
always remember the worth of a soul.\
5:26\
We do this best by following\
the Savior’s admonition,\
5:29\
“Love one another as I have loved you.”\
5:31\
He also taught, “Inasmuch as ye\
have done it unto one of\
5:34\
the least of these my brethren,\
ye have done it unto me.”\
5:38\
The book of Proverbs wisely counsels,\
“Withhold not good from them to whom it\
5:43\
is due, when it is in the power\
of thine hand to do it.”\
5:47\
We will never regret being too kind.\
5:50\
In God's eyes, kindness is synonymous\
with greatness.\
5:54\
Part of being kind is being forgiving\
and non-judgmental.\
5:58\
Many years ago, our young family\
was going to see a movie\
6:00\
for family home evening. We were all in\
the van except for one of our sons\
6:04\
and my wife, Valerie. It was dark\
outside and as our son threw open\
6:08\
the door and ran toward the car,\
6:10\
he accidentally kicked what he thought\
was our cat on the porch.\
6:14\
Unfortunately for our son and my wife,\
who was right behind him,\
6:18\
it was not our cat, but rather a very\
unhappy skunk who let them know it.\
6:25\
We all returned to the house\
where they both showered\
6:28\
and washed their hair with tomato juice,\
6:30\
the supposed sure remedy to\
eliminate skunk odor.\
6:36\
By the time they had cleaned up\
and changed their clothes,\
6:38\
we were all desensitized to any odor,\
6:40\
so we decided we were okay to\
go to the movie after all.\
6:47\
Once we were seated at the back\
of the theater, one by one,\
6:50\
the people around us suddenly decided\
to go out to get popcorn.\
6:55\
When they came back, however, no one\
returned to their original seat.\
7:01\
We have laughed as we recalled\
that experience.\
7:04\
But what if all of our sins\
had an odor?\
7:07\
What if we could smell dishonesty, lust,\
envy, or pride?\
7:13\
With our weaknesses revealed,\
7:15\
we would hopefully be a little more\
considerate and careful of others\
7:18\
and likewise they with us as we make\
the needed changes in our lives.\
7:23\
I actually love the smell\
of tobacco in church\
7:25\
because it indicates someone\
is trying to change.\
7:29\
They need our welcoming\
arms around them.\
7:32\
President Russell M. Nelson\
has wisely said, “One of\
7:35\
the easiest ways to identify\
7:36\
a true follower of Jesus Christ is how\
compassionately that person treats\
7:41\
other people.” Paul\
wrote to the Ephesians,\
7:45\
“And be ye kind one to another,\
tenderhearted, forgiving one another,\
7:50\
even as God, for Christ’s sake,\
hath forgiven you.”\
7:55\
As disciples of Jesus Christ,\
7:56\
we are asked to trust Heavenly\
Father and our Savior\
7:59\
and not attempt to replace Them.\
8:02\
Jesus Christ knows everyone's\
imperfections perfectly\
8:05\
and will judge them perfectly.\
8:08\
My fourth happiness hallmark is to\
maintain an eternal perspective.\
8:12\
Our Father’s plan stretches\
into the eternities.\
8:14\
It is easy to focus on the here and\
now and forget the hereafter.\
8:20\
I was taught this lesson powerfully\
8:22\
a number of years ago by our then\
16-year-old daughter, Jennifer.\
8:26\
She was about to have a double\
lung transplant where\
8:29\
the five diseased lobes of her lungs\
would be completely removed\
8:33\
and replaced by two healthy,\
8:34\
smaller lobes donated by two\
amazing Christlike friends.\
8:42\
It was a very high risk procedure. Yet,\
8:46\
the night before her surgery,\
8:47\
Jennifer almost preached to me with all\
of her 90 pounds saying, “Don’t worry,\
8:52\
Dad. Tomorrow I will wake up with\
new lungs, or I will wake up in\
8:56\
a better place. Either way will\
be great.” That is faith.\
9:02\
That is eternal perspective.\
9:06\
Seeing life from an eternal vantage\
point provides clarity, comfort,\
9:09\
courage, and hope. After the surgery,\
9:13\
when the long-awaited day came to remove\
the breathing tube and turn off\
9:16\
the ventilator that had been\
helping Jennifer breathe,\
9:19\
we anxiously waited to see if her two\
smaller lobes would work. When she took\
9:24\
her first breath, she immediately\
started crying. Seeing\
9:26\
our concern, she quickly exclaimed,\
“It’s just so good to breathe!”\
9:32\
Ever since that day, I have\
thanked Heavenly Father,\
9:34\
morning and night, for my\
ability to breathe.\
9:38\
We are surrounded by innumerable\
blessings that we can easily take\
9:41\
for granted if we are not mindful.\
9:44\
Conversely, when nothing is expected\
and everything is appreciated,\
9:48\
life becomes magical. President Nelson\
has said, “Each new morning is\
9:54\
a gift from God. Even the air we breathe\
is a loving loan from Him.\
9:58\
He preserves us from day to day\
10:00\
and supports us from one\
moment to another.\
10:03\
Therefore, our first noble deed\
of the morning should be\
10:05\
a humble prayer of gratitude.”\
10:08\
That brings me to my fifth\
and final observation,\
10:10\
which is you will never be happier than\
you are grateful. The Lord declared,\
10:15\
“And he who receiveth all things with\
thankfulness shall be made glorious.”\
10:19\
Perhaps this is because gratitude gives\
birth to a multitude of other virtues.\
10:24\
How our awareness would change if\
every morning we awoke with only\
10:27\
the blessings we were grateful\
for the night before.\
10:31\
Failure to appreciate our\
blessings can result in\
10:33\
a sense of dissatisfaction which can\
rob us of the joy and happiness\
10:37\
that gratitude engenders.\
Those in the great\
10:40\
and spacious building entice\
us to look beyond the mark,\
10:43\
thereby missing the mark entirely.\
10:46\
In reality, the greatest happiness\
10:47\
and blessing of mortality will be found\
in whom we have become through God's\
10:51\
grace as we make and keep sacred\
covenants with Him.\
10:55\
Our Savior will polish\
and refine us through\
10:57\
the merits of His atoning sacrifice and\
10:59\
has said of those\
who willingly follow Him,\
11:02\
“They shall be mine in that day when\
I shall come to make up my jewels.”\
11:06\
I promise you that if we\
build our lives upon\
11:08\
the foundation of Jesus Christ,\
11:10\
value our true identity as sons\
and daughters of God,\
11:13\
remember the worth of a soul,\
11:15\
maintain an eternal perspective,\
11:17\
and gratefully appreciate\
our many blessings,\
11:20\
especially Christ’s invitation\
to come unto Him,\
11:22\
we can find the true happiness we\
seek during this mortal adventure.\
11:27\
Life will still have its challenges,\
11:28\
but we will be able to better face each\
with a sense of purpose and peace\
11:32\
because of the eternal truths\
we understand and live by.\
11:36\
I bear you my witness of the reality\
of God, our loving Father,\
11:38\
and of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.\
11:41\
I also testify of living prophets,\
seers, and revelators.\
11:44\
What a blessing it is to receive the\
counsel of heaven through them.\
11:48\
As the Savior clearly stated,\
11:50\
“Whether by mine own voice or by\
the voice of my servants,\
11:53\
it is the same.” In the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
