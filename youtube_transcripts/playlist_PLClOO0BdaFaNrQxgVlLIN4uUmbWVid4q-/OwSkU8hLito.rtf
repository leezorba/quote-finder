I was introduced to a trail in Israel\
by my good friend Ilan.\
0:06\
“It’s called the Jesus Trail,” he said,\
0:08\
“because it’s the path from Nazareth to\
Capernaum that many believe Jesus\
0:13\
walked.” I decided right then and there\
I wanted to walk that trail.\
0:18\
So I began planning a trip to Israel.\
0:21\
Six weeks before the trip,\
I broke my ankle.\
0:24\
My husband worried about the injury.\
0:27\
My greatest concern was how I would walk\
the Jesus trail one month later.\
0:32\
I am stubborn by nature, so I didn't\
cancel the plane tickets.\
0:37\
I remember meeting our Israeli guide\
that beautiful June morning.\
0:40\
I hopped out of the van and then pulled\
out a set of crutches and\
0:44\
a knee scooter. Maya, our guide, took\
one look at my cast and said, “Uh,\
0:50\
I don’t think you can walk this\
trail in that condition.”\
0:54\
“Maybe not,” I replied. “But there’s\
nothing that prevents me from trying.”\
0:59\
She gave a slight nod and we began.\
1:02\
I love her for that, for believing\
I could walk the trail broken.\
1:08\
I navigated the steep path and the\
boulders for a time on my own,\
1:13\
then moved by the sincerity\
of my commitment,\
1:16\
Maya pulled out a thin rope, tied it\
to the handlebars of my scooter,\
1:21\
and began to pull. She pulled me up\
the hills through lemon orchards\
1:26\
and along the banks of\
the Sea of Galilee.\
1:28\
At the journey's end, I\
expressed gratitude\
1:31\
for my sweet guide who had helped\
me accomplish something\
1:34\
I could have never accomplished\
on my own.\
1:37\
When the Lord called Enoch to journey\
through the land and testify of Him,\
1:42\
Enoch hesitated. He was just\
a lad, slow of speech.\
1:46\
How could he walk that path\
in his condition?\
1:50\
He was blinded by what\
was broken in him.\
1:53\
The Lord’s answer to what hindered\
him was simple and immediate:\
1:57\
“Walk with me.” Like Enoch, we must\
remember that the one who was bruised\
2:03\
and broken for us will allow mortality\
to do its work in us.\
2:08\
But He doesn’t ask us to face\
those challenges alone.\
2:12\
No matter the heaviness of our story\
or the current course of our path,\
2:17\
He will invite us to walk with Him.\
2:21\
Think of the young man in a spot\
of trouble who met the Lord in\
2:24\
a wilderness place. Jacob had journeyed\
far from home. In the dark of night,\
2:29\
he had a dream that not only\
contained a ladder,\
2:32\
but also held significant\
covenant promises,\
2:35\
including what I like to call\
the “five-finger promise.”\
2:40\
On that night, the Lord\
stood beside Jacob,\
2:43\
introduced Himself as the God of Jacob’s\
father, and then promised,\
2:48\
I am with you. I will keep you safe.\
I will bring you home again.\
2:53\
I will not leave you. I will\
keep my promise to you.\
2:58\
Jacob had a choice to make.\
3:00\
He could choose to live his life simply\
acquainted with the God of his father,\
3:05\
or he could choose to live life in\
committed covenant relationship with\
3:10\
Him. Years later, Jacob testified of a\
life lived within the Lord’s covenant\
3:15\
promises: “God ... answered me in the\
day of my distress and was with me in\
3:21\
the way which I went.” Just\
as He did for Jacob,\
3:24\
the Lord will answer each of us in our\
day of distress if we choose to tether\
3:29\
our life with His. He has promised\
to walk with us in\
3:34\
the way. We call this walking\
the covenant path—\
3:39\
a path that begins with the\
covenant of baptism\
3:41\
and leads to deeper covenants\
we make in the temple.\
3:45\
Perhaps you hear those words\
and think of checkboxes.\
3:48\
Maybe all you see is a\
path of requirements.\
3:51\
A closer look reveals something\
more compelling.\
3:55\
A covenant is not only about a contract,\
although that is important.\
4:00\
It’s about a relationship.\
4:03\
President Russell M. Nelson taught,\
4:05\
“The covenant path is all about\
our relationship with God.”\
4:10\
Consider a marriage covenant.\
4:12\
The wedding date is important,\
4:14\
but equally important is the\
relationship forged through\
4:18\
the life lived together afterward.\
4:21\
The same is true with a covenant\
relationship with God.\
4:24\
Conditions have been set and there will\
be expectations along the way.\
4:30\
And yet He invites each of us\
to come as we are able,\
4:35\
with full purpose of heart and to press\
forward with Him at our side,\
4:39\
trusting that His promised\
blessings will come.\
4:43\
Scripture reminds us that often those\
blessings come in His own time\
4:47\
and in His own way—38 years, 12 years,\
immediately, as your trail will demand,\
4:55\
so His succor will be. His is a mission\
of condescension.\
5:01\
Jesus Christ will meet us\
where we are as we are.\
5:07\
This is the why of the garden,\
the cross, and the tomb.\
5:11\
The Savior was sent to help us overcome.\
5:15\
But staying where we are won't bring\
the deliverance we seek.\
5:19\
Just as He didn’t leave Jacob\
there in the dirt,\
5:22\
the Lord doesn’t intend to leave\
any of us where we are.\
5:26\
His is also a mission of ascension.\
5:29\
He will work within us to lift\
us up to where He is and in\
5:34\
the process enable us to become as He\
is. Jesus Christ came to lift us.\
5:42\
He wants to help us become. This\
is the why of the temple.\
5:47\
We must remember it's not the course\
alone that will exalt us.\
5:51\
It's the companion, our Savior.\
5:54\
And this is the why of covenant\
relationship.\
5:58\
When I was in Israel, I visited\
the Western Wall. For the Jews,\
6:02\
this is the most holy site in Israel. It\
is all that remains of their temple.\
6:07\
Most wear their finest when they\
visit this sacred place.\
6:10\
Their choice of garment is\
6:12\
a symbol of their devotion to\
their relationship with God.\
6:17\
They visit the wall to read scripture,\
to worship,\
6:20\
and to pour out their prayers.\
6:22\
The plea for a temple in their midst\
consumes their every day,\
6:27\
their every prayer, this longing\
for a house of covenant.\
6:31\
I admire their devotion. When\
I returned home from Israel,\
6:35\
I listened more closely to\
6:37\
the conversations around\
me regarding covenants.\
6:40\
I noticed people asking, “Why should\
I walk a covenant path?”\
6:45\
“Do I need to enter a house\
for making covenants?”\
6:49\
“Why do I wear the holy garment?”\
6:52\
“Should I invest in a covenant\
relationship with the Lord?”\
6:57\
The answer to these good and important\
questions is simple.\
7:01\
It depends on what degree of\
relationship you want to experience\
7:06\
with Jesus Christ. Each of us will have\
to discover our own response to those\
7:12\
deeply personal questions. Here is mine.\
7:17\
I walk this path as a beloved daughter\
of heavenly parents,\
7:20\
divinely known and deeply trusted.\
7:23\
As a child of the covenant, I am\
eligible to receive promised blessings.\
7:28\
I have chosen to walk with the Lord.\
7:31\
I have been called to stand\
as a witness of Christ.\
7:35\
When the path feels overwhelming, I am\
strengthened with enabling grace.\
7:40\
Each time I cross the threshold\
of His house,\
7:44\
I experience deeper covenant\
relationship with Him.\
7:47\
I am sanctified with His Spirit,\
endowed with His power,\
7:52\
and set apart to build His kingdom.\
Through a process of daily repentance\
7:58\
and weekly partaking of the sacrament,\
8:00\
I am learning to become steadfast\
and to go about doing good.\
8:04\
I walk this path with Jesus Christ,\
8:07\
looking forward to the promised\
day when He will come again.\
8:10\
Then I will be sealed His and lifted\
up as a holy daughter of God.\
8:16\
This is why I walk the covenant path.\
8:19\
This is why I cling to\
covenant promises.\
8:22\
This is why I enter His covenant house.\
8:26\
This is why I wear the holy garment\
as a constant reminder.\
8:32\
Because I want to live in committed\
covenant relationship with Him.\
8:38\
Perhaps you do too. Begin where you are.\
Don't let your condition hinder you.\
8:44\
Remember, pace or placement on\
the path are not as important\
8:50\
as progress. Ask someone\
you trust who is on\
8:54\
the covenant path to introduce you to\
the Savior they have come to know.\
8:58\
Learn more of Him. Invest in\
9:01\
the relationship by entering\
into covenant with Him.\
9:04\
It doesn’t matter your age or your\
condition, you can walk with Him.\
9:09\
After we finished walking the Jesus\
Trail, Maya did not take back her rope.\
9:13\
She left it tied to my scooter.\
9:16\
For the next few days,\
my teenaged nephews\
9:18\
and their friend took turns pulling me\
through the streets of Jerusalem.\
9:22\
They made sure I did not miss\
out on the stories of Jesus.\
9:26\
I was reminded of the strength\
of the rising generation.\
9:31\
We can learn from you. You have a\
genuine desire to know the guide,\
9:36\
Jesus Christ. You trust the strength\
of the rope that tethers us to Him.\
9:42\
You are unusually gifted in\
gathering others to Him.\
9:47\
Thankfully, we walk this path together,\
9:50\
calling out encouragement along the way\
9:54\
as we share our personal\
experience with Christ\
9:57\
we will strengthen personal\
devotion. Of this\
10:02\
I bear witness in the name of Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
