Members of the choir, thank\
you so very much\
0:04\
for that beautiful witness\
of our Lord and Savior.\
0:10\
While in South America recently,\
0:12\
Brother Roger Parra from Venezuela\
shared the following experience with me:\
0:18\
“In 2019, Venezuela was shaken by\
problems that caused a power blackout\
0:23\
for five days. Chaos and anarchy\
reigned in the streets\
0:28\
and many desperate people did\
not have sufficient food.\
0:32\
Some began looting food businesses,\
destroying everything in their path.\
0:37\
As the owner of a small bakery, I was\
very worried about our business.\
0:43\
As a family, we decided\
to give away all\
0:46\
the food in our bakery to people in\
need. Through one very dark night,\
0:52\
riots were everywhere. My only concern\
was for the safety of my beloved wife\
0:58\
and children. At dawn,\
I went to our bakery.\
1:04\
Sadly, every nearby food business\
had been destroyed by looters.\
1:09\
But to my great astonishment,\
our bakery was intact.\
1:13\
Nothing had been destroyed. I humbly\
thanked my Heavenly Father.\
1:19\
Arriving home, I told my family of\
God's blessing and protection.\
1:24\
They were all so grateful.\
1:27\
My oldest son, Rogelio, only\
12 years old, said, ’Papa!\
1:32\
I know why our store was protected. You\
and Mama always pay your tithes.’”\
1:39\
Brother Parra concluded: “The words\
of Malachi came into my mind.\
1:46\
’I will rebuke the devourer\
for your sakes,\
1:49\
and he shall not destroy the\
fruits of your ground.′\
1:54\
We knelt down and gratefully thanked our\
Heavenly Father for His miracle.”\
2:03\
All that we have and all that\
we are comes from God.\
2:07\
As disciples of Christ, we willingly\
share with those around us. With all\
2:12\
the Lord gives to us, He has asked us\
to return to Him and His kingdom\
2:17\
on Earth ten percent of our increase.\
2:22\
He has promised us that as we\
are honest in our tithes,\
2:26\
He will “open ... the windows\
of heaven and pour out\
2:30\
a blessing, that there shall not\
be room enough to receive it.”\
2:34\
He has promised us that He will\
protect us from evil.\
2:40\
These promises are so certain\
the Lord declares,\
2:44\
“Prove me now herewith,” a phrase found\
nowhere else in the scriptures.\
2:51\
The windows of heaven open in many ways.\
2:54\
Some are temporal, but\
many are spiritual.\
2:58\
Some are subtle and easy to overlook.\
Trust in the Lord's timing.\
3:03\
The blessings always come.\
3:07\
We sorrow with those who struggle\
to have the necessities of life.\
3:11\
The Church recently donated 54 million\
US dollars to provide relief to\
3:19\
vulnerable children and\
mothers across the world.\
3:22\
And with the offerings from\
your monthly fast,\
3:26\
our good bishops help thousands each\
week who temporarily need food\
3:32\
on their tables, clothes on their backs,\
and shelter over their heads.\
3:38\
The only permanent solution to\
the poverty of this world is\
3:42\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
3:46\
The apostle Paul warned that the\
wisdom of men understands\
3:50\
the things of men, but has difficulty\
understanding the things of God.\
3:56\
The world speaks of tithing\
in terms of our money,\
4:00\
but the sacred law of tithing is\
principally a matter of our faith.\
4:06\
Being honest in our tithes\
4:09\
is one way we show our\
willingness to put\
4:11\
the Lord first in our lives above\
our own cares and interest.\
4:17\
I promise you that as you\
trust in the Lord,\
4:20\
the blessings of heaven will follow.\
4:24\
Jesus said to give “unto Caesar\
the things which are Caesar’s;\
4:27\
and unto God, the things\
that are God’s.”\
4:31\
The resurrected Savior asked the\
Nephites to write into their record\
4:36\
His promises found in Malachi.\
4:38\
In our day, the Lord reconfirmed the\
divine law of tithing, declaring,\
4:44\
“This shall be the beginning of\
the tithing of my people.\
4:48\
And ... [they] shall pay one-tenth of\
all their interest annually;\
4:53\
and this shall be a standing\
law unto them forever.”\
4:59\
The Lord clearly directed how\
tithing should be dispersed,\
5:03\
saying, “Bring ye all the tithes\
into the storehouse,”\
5:07\
meaning bring the tithes into\
His restored kingdom,\
5:11\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
5:15\
He directed that the use of these\
sacred tithes would be prayerfully\
5:20\
considered by a council of\
the First Presidency,\
5:24\
the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,\
the Presiding Bishopric,\
5:28\
“and by mine own voice unto them,\
saith the Lord.”\
5:33\
These sacred funds do not belong\
to the leaders of the Church.\
5:38\
They belong to the Lord. His servants\
are painstakingly aware of\
5:44\
the sacred nature of their stewardship.\
5:48\
President Gordon B. Hinckley recounted\
this childhood experience:\
5:52\
“When I was a boy, I raised a question\
with my father ... concerning\
5:56\
the expenditure of Church funds.\
5:58\
He reminded me that mine is the God-\
given obligation to pay my tithes\
6:03\
and offerings. When I do so,\
6:06\
[my father said,] that which I\
give is no longer mine.\
6:11\
It belongs to the Lord to whom I\
consecrate it.” His father added,\
6:18\
“What the authorities of the Church do\
with it need not concern you, [Gordon.]\
6:23\
They are answerable to the\
Lord, who will require\
6:27\
an accounting at their hands.”\
Close quote.\
6:32\
We deeply feel the weight of being\
“answerable to the Lord.”\
6:39\
From the generous tithes and offerings\
you have consecrated to the Lord,\
6:43\
last year more than 1 billion US dollars\
were used to bless those in need.\
6:50\
In our momentous responsibility to take\
the restored gospel across the world,\
6:56\
we have more than 71,000 missionaries\
serving in 414 missions.\
7:03\
Because of your tithes and offerings,\
7:07\
missionaries, regardless of their\
family financial situation,\
7:11\
are able to serve. Temples\
are being built across\
7:15\
the world in unprecedented numbers.\
Currently, 177 temples are in operation,\
7:22\
59 are currently under construction\
or renovation,\
7:26\
and 79 more are in planning and design.\
7:31\
Your tithes are allowing the blessings\
of the temple to be in places only\
7:37\
the Lord could foresee. There\
are more than 30,000\
7:41\
congregations housed in\
thousands of chapels\
7:46\
and other facilities in 195\
countries and territories.\
7:51\
Because of your faithful tithes,\
7:54\
the Church is being established in\
faraway places you may never visit\
7:59\
among righteous Saints\
you may never know.\
8:02\
The Church currently sponsors five\
institutions of higher learning.\
8:07\
These serve more than 145,000 students.\
One hundred and ten thousand\
8:14\
classes are being taught each week\
in our seminaries and institutes.\
8:20\
These blessings and so many more come\
in large measure from the young\
8:26\
and old of every economic circumstance\
who pay an honest tithe.\
8:33\
The spiritual power of the divine law\
of tithing is not measured by\
8:37\
the amount of money contributed,\
for both the prosperous and\
8:41\
the poor are commanded by the Lord to\
contribute ten percent of their income.\
8:47\
The power comes from placing\
our trust in the Lord.\
8:53\
The added abundance of the Lord conveyed\
through your generous tithes\
8:58\
has strengthened the reserves\
of the Church,\
9:01\
providing opportunities to advance the\
Lord's work beyond anything we have\
9:07\
yet experienced. All is\
known by the Lord,\
9:11\
and in time we will see all His\
sacred purposes fulfilled.\
9:17\
The blessings of tithing\
come in many ways.\
9:20\
In 1998, I accompanied then-\
Elder Henry B. Eyring to\
9:25\
a large church meeting in the Utah area\
now known as Silicon Slopes,\
9:31\
a community of great innovation\
in technology.\
9:35\
It was a time of growing prosperity,\
9:38\
and Elder Eyring cautioned\
9:40\
the Saints about comparing what they\
had with others and wanting more.\
9:46\
I will always remember his promise that\
as they paid an honest tithe,\
9:52\
their desire for more material\
possessions would diminish.\
9:57\
Within two years, the technology\
bubble burst.\
10:01\
Many lost their jobs and companies\
struggled during this time of financial\
10:06\
adjustment. Those who followed\
10:09\
the counsel of President\
Eyring were blessed.\
10:14\
His promise reminded me\
of another experience.\
10:17\
I met 12-year-old Charlotte Hlimi\
near Carcassonne, France,\
10:22\
in 1990, while serving as\
a mission president.\
10:26\
The Hlimis were a faithful\
family living in\
10:29\
an apartment with eight children.\
10:31\
They had a picture of the Savior\
and of the prophet on the wall.\
10:36\
In the interview for her\
patriarchal blessing,\
10:39\
I asked Charlotte if she\
paid an honest tithe.\
10:43\
She responded, “Yes, President Andersen.\
10:47\
My mother has taught me that there\
are temporal blessings\
10:50\
and spiritual blessings that come\
from paying our tithing.\
10:55\
My mother taught me that if\
we always pay our tithing,\
10:59\
we will want for nothing. And President\
Anderson, we want for nothing.”\
11:07\
In giving me permission\
to share her story,\
11:10\
Charlotte, now 45 and sealed\
in the temple,\
11:13\
commented, “My testimony of tithing\
was very real at the time,\
11:19\
and it's even stronger now. I am deeply\
grateful for this commandment.\
11:25\
As I live it, I continue to\
be abundantly blessed.”\
11:31\
One day each of us will finish\
our earthly journey.\
11:36\
Twenty-five years ago, just days\
before my mother-in-law,\
11:41\
Martha Williams, died of cancer, she\
received a small check in the mail.\
11:46\
She immediately asked my wife, Kathy,\
for her checkbook to pay her tithing.\
11:52\
As her mother was so weakened that\
she could scarcely write,\
11:56\
Kathy asked if she could write\
the check for her.\
11:59\
Her mother responded, “No, Kathy,\
I want to do it myself.”\
12:05\
And then she quietly added, “I want\
to be right before the Lord.”\
12:12\
One of the final things Kathy did\
12:14\
for her mother was to hand her tithing\
envelope to her bishop.\
12:20\
My brothers and sisters, The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is\
12:26\
out of obscurity, bringing remarkable\
blessings across the Earth.\
12:31\
There will be those who cheer us\
forward and those who do not.\
12:36\
I have thought of the words of\
the wise Gamaliel, who,\
12:41\
upon hearing of the miracles of\
the apostles Peter and John,\
12:45\
warned the council in Jerusalem,\
“Let [these men] alone:\
12:52\
for if ... this work be of men,\
it will come to nought;\
12:56\
But if it be of God, ye\
cannot overthrow it;\
13:00\
lest ... ye be found even to\
fight against God.”\
13:05\
You and I are part of God's important\
work upon the earth.\
13:09\
It will not come to nought, but will\
continue to move across the world,\
13:14\
preparing the way for\
the Savior's return.\
13:17\
I testify to the words of President\
Russell M. Nelson:\
13:22\
“In coming days, we will see the\
greatest manifestations of\
13:26\
the Savior’s power that the\
world has ever seen. Between\
13:30\
now and the time He returns ..., He\
will bestow countless privileges,\
13:37\
blessings, and miracles upon the\
faithful.” This is my witness.\
13:45\
Jesus is the Christ. This\
is His holy work.\
13:49\
He will come again. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
