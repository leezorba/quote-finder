I feel privileged to have had the\
blessing of hearing my quorum\
0:07\
president, M. Russell Ballard, bear\
his precious testimony.\
0:13\
He’s been a General Authority longer\
than anybody else that\
0:19\
has lived at this time.\
0:24\
We live in a time when peaceable\
followers of Christ experience unique\
0:30\
challenges. Those who believe\
in, humbly worship,\
0:35\
and testify of Jesus Christ have\
always experienced trials,\
0:40\
tribulation, and adversities. My wife,\
Mary, and I are no different.\
0:46\
In the last few years, we have seen many\
of our close high school friends,\
0:50\
missionary companions, some\
of their precious wives,\
0:54\
and former work associates pass away, or\
as President Russell M. Nelson has said,\
1:02\
graduate to the other side of the veil.\
1:05\
We have seen some who were raised\
in faith and belief step off\
1:08\
the covenant path. Sadly,\
1:11\
we lost a grandson of 23 who died\
in a tragic single car accident.\
1:17\
Some dear friends, family members,\
1:20\
and colleagues have also endured\
significant health challenges.\
1:26\
Whenever trials occur, we mourn\
1:29\
and strive to bear one\
another's burdens.\
1:32\
We lament the things that will\
not be accomplished and\
1:34\
the songs that will not be sung.\
1:37\
Bad things happen to good people\
on this mortal journey.\
1:41\
The devastating fires\
on Maui in Hawaii,\
1:45\
southern Chile, and Canada are examples\
of horrendous events\
1:49\
good people sometimes face.\
1:53\
We read in the Pearl of Great Price\
that the Lord revealed to Abraham\
1:57\
the eternal nature of spirits.\
2:00\
Abraham learned of our “pre-earth life\
foreordination, the Creation,\
2:06\
the choosing of a Redeemer,\
and [this mortal life,\
2:09\
which is] the second estate of man.\
2:13\
The Redeemer declared, “We will\
make an earth whereon\
2:17\
these may dwell; and we will prove them\
herewith, to see if they will do all\
2:24\
things whatsoever the Lord their\
God shall command them.”\
2:29\
Now all of us are here in\
2:31\
the second estate of our journey of\
progression toward a kingdom of glory\
2:36\
as part of God's great plan of\
salvation and exaltation.\
2:41\
We are blessed with agency and subject\
to the trials of mortality.\
2:46\
This is the time allotted for\
us to prepare to meet God.\
2:53\
We are blessed to know of Jesus Christ\
and His role in the plan.\
2:57\
We have the privilege to become members\
of His restored Church,\
3:01\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
3:05\
As peaceable followers of Christ, we\
strive to live His commandments.\
3:12\
It has never been easy\
for His followers,\
3:15\
nor was it easy for the Savior to\
faithfully fulfill His mortal mission.\
3:22\
The scriptures are clear. Many will\
succumb to an “eat, drink, and be merry,\
3:26\
for tomorrow we die” approach.\
3:29\
Other non believers retreat to somber\
enclaves of like-minded participants\
3:34\
who advocate for the next new thing\
and “philosophies of men.”\
3:40\
They know not where to find the truth.\
3:43\
Peaceable followers of Christ\
do not follow either path.\
3:47\
We are warm, engaged members of\
the communities where we live.\
3:51\
We love share and invite all of God’s\
children to follow Christ’s teachings.\
3:58\
We follow the counsel of our beloved\
prophet, President Nelson.\
4:02\
We choose the role of a peacemaker\
now and always.\
4:08\
This inspired approach is consistent\
with both the scriptures\
4:12\
and prophetic direction. In 1829,\
4:15\
the restored Church had not\
yet been organized,\
4:18\
nor had the Book of Mormon\
been published.\
4:21\
A small group of struggling people,\
moved by the Spirit of God,\
4:26\
followed the prophet Joseph Smith.\
4:29\
The Lord revealed to Joseph counsel\
for difficult times: “Fear\
4:33\
not, little flock; do good; let earth\
and hell combine against you,\
4:40\
for if ye are built upon my rock, they\
cannot prevail.” He also counseled them:\
4:46\
“Look unto me in every thought; doubt\
not, fear not.” “Be faithful,\
4:52\
keep my commandments, and ye shall\
inherit the kingdom of heaven.”\
4:57\
Clearly our heavenly destiny is not\
altered when we suffer adversity.\
5:04\
In Hebrews, we are counseled\
to “come boldly unto\
5:07\
the throne of grace, that\
we may obtain mercy,\
5:11\
and find grace to help in time of need.”\
5:15\
“[Jesus Christ] is the author\
of eternal salvation.”\
5:19\
I love the words of Mormon,\
quoted by his son Moroni,\
5:23\
commending the peaceable\
followers of Christ\
5:26\
“because of your peaceable walk\
with the children of men.”\
5:31\
For those of us in the Church striving\
to be peaceable followers of Christ,\
5:36\
a brighter day awaits us as we focus on\
our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\
5:41\
Trials are a part of mortality and occur\
in everyone's life throughout\
5:46\
the world. This includes major\
conflicts between countries\
5:50\
and individuals. Church leaders\
are frequently asked,\
5:55\
“Why does a just God allow bad things to\
happen, especially to good people?”\
6:01\
And “Why are those who\
are righteous and in\
6:03\
the Lord’s service not immune\
from such tragedies?”\
6:08\
We do not know all the answers;\
6:10\
however, we do know important principles\
that allow us to face trials,\
6:16\
tribulation, and adversities with\
faith and confidence in\
6:21\
a bright future that awaits\
for each of us.\
6:24\
No better example exists in scripture\
with respect to passing through\
6:28\
tribulation than the word of\
the Lord to Joseph Smith,\
6:32\
the Prophet, while he was a prisoner in\
Liberty Jail. The Lord in part declared:\
6:38\
“If the very jaws of hell shall gape\
6:41\
open the mouth wide after\
thee, know thou, my son,\
6:45\
that all these things shall give\
the experience and shall be\
6:48\
for thy good. The Son of man hath\
descended below them all.\
6:53\
Art thou greater than he? ... Fear\
6:56\
not what man can do, for God shall be\
with you forever and ever.” End quote.\
7:04\
It is clear we have a Father in Heaven\
who knows and loves us personally\
7:09\
and understands our suffering perfectly.\
7:12\
His Son, Jesus Christ, is\
our Savior and Redeemer.\
7:17\
President Russell M. Nelson and\
President M. Russell Ballard have\
7:20\
both strongly emphasized\
the significance of\
7:24\
the new second edition of “Preach My\
Gospel.” I share their enthusiasm.\
7:30\
This new addition, amplifying sacred\
scripture, powerfully proclaims, quote,\
7:37\
“In His atoning sacrifice, Jesus Christ\
took upon Himself our pains,\
7:43\
afflictions, and infirmities.\
7:46\
Because of this, He knows,\
’according to the flesh\
7:51\
how to succor his people according\
to their infirmities.′\
7:56\
He invites, ‘Come unto me,’ and as we\
do, He gives us rest, hope, strength,\
8:04\
perspective, and healing. As we rely\
on Jesus Christ and His Atonement,\
8:10\
He can help us endure our trials,\
sicknesses, and pain.\
8:15\
We can be filled with joy,\
peace, and consolation.\
8:19\
All that is unfair about life\
can be made right through\
8:23\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.”\
End quote.\
8:27\
We can joyfully be peaceable\
followers of Christ.\
8:32\
Our Father’s plan of happiness for His\
children includes not only a mortal\
8:36\
and mortal life, but also a potential\
for eternal life,\
8:40\
including a great and glorious reunion\
with those we have lost.\
8:44\
All wrongs will be righted,\
8:46\
and we will see with perfect clarity\
and faultless perspective\
8:50\
and understanding. Church leaders have\
compared this perspective with someone\
8:55\
walking into the middle\
of a three act play.\
8:58\
Those without knowledge of\
8:59\
the Father’s plan do not understand\
what happened in the first act or\
9:03\
the pre-mortal existence and the\
purposes established there.\
9:08\
Nor do they understand\
the clarification\
9:10\
and resolution that comes\
in the third act,\
9:13\
which is the glorious fulfillment\
of the Father’s plan.\
9:17\
Many do not appreciate that under His\
loving and comprehensive plan,\
9:23\
those who appear to be disadvantaged\
through no fault of their own are not\
9:28\
ultimately impacted. The\
scriptures are clear:\
9:33\
peaceable followers of Christ who\
are righteous and follow the Savior\
9:37\
and keep His commandments\
will be blessed.\
9:40\
One of the most important scriptures\
9:42\
for those who are righteous regardless\
of their situation in life,\
9:46\
is part of King Benjamin's\
address to his people.\
9:49\
He promises that those\
who faithfully keep\
9:53\
the commandments are blessed\
in all things in this life\
9:57\
and “are received into heaven,\
[and] dwell with God in\
10:01\
a state of never-ending happiness.”\
10:04\
We recognize that almost all of\
us have experienced physical\
10:07\
and spiritual storms in our lives, some\
devastating. A loving Father in Heaven\
10:13\
and His Son, Jesus Christ, who is\
the head of His restored Church,\
10:18\
have provided us scriptures and\
prophets to prepare us,\
10:21\
warn us about dangers, and give us\
guidance to prepare and protect us.\
10:27\
Some directions require\
immediate action;\
10:30\
some provide protection for\
many years in the future.\
10:35\
The Lord's preface to the Doctrine\
10:37\
and Covenants, section 1 admonishes\
us to “give heed to the words of\
10:42\
the prophets.” Section 1 also\
cautions us, “Prepare ye,\
10:47\
prepare ye for that which is to come.”\
10:50\
The Lord provides His people\
a chance to prepare for\
10:55\
the challenges they will face.\
10:57\
The Lord gave a powerful revelation to\
President Brigham Young on January\
11:02\
14, 1847, at Winter Quarters.\
11:07\
This revelation is a classic example\
of the Lord preparing people\
11:11\
for that which is to come.\
11:13\
The faithful Saints had begun their\
exodus to the mountain sanctuary of\
11:18\
the Salt Lake Valley. They\
had successfully built\
11:21\
the Nauvoo Temple and received\
sacred saving ordinances.\
11:26\
They had been driven out of Missouri\
11:28\
and their persecutors had driven\
them out of Nauvoo in\
11:32\
a terrible winter season.\
11:35\
The revelation to Brigham gave practical\
counsel on how to prepare\
11:39\
for the exodus. The Lord placed special\
emphasis on taking care of the poor,\
11:45\
the widows, the fatherless, and the\
families of those serving in\
11:49\
the Mormon Battalion as the main\
body of Saints proceeded\
11:54\
on their perilous journey.\
11:56\
In addition to other advice\
to live righteously,\
11:59\
the Lord emphasized two other principles\
that continue to be\
12:03\
applicable today. First, He encouraged\
them to “praise the Lord with singing,\
12:09\
with music, with dancing, and with a\
prayer of praise and thanksgiving.”\
12:14\
Second, the Lord counseled\
if they were “sorrowful,\
12:18\
call on the Lord thy God with\
supplication, that your souls may be\
12:23\
joyful.” These two admonitions\
are great counsel\
12:27\
for our own day. Lives full of praise,\
12:31\
music, and thanksgiving\
are uniquely blessed.\
12:34\
Being joyful and relying on heavenly\
help through prayer is\
12:39\
a powerful way to be peaceable\
followers of Christ.\
12:43\
Striving always to be of good cheer\
helps avoid being cast down in spirit.\
12:50\
The final line of a perceptive hymn\
conveys the ultimate answer in\
12:57\
a beautiful fashion: “Earth has no\
sorrow that heaven cannot heal.”\
13:06\
As an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ,\
13:09\
I testify that peaceable followers of\
Christ will find personal peace in this\
13:15\
life and a glorious, heavenly reunion.\
13:18\
I bear a sure witness of the\
Savior’s divinity and\
13:22\
the reality of His Atonement. He\
is our Savior and Redeemer.\
13:27\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
