My dear brothers and sisters,\
I am deeply grateful\
0:04\
to speak with you today. At my age,\
0:08\
each new day brings wonderful as\
well as challenging surprises.\
0:14\
Three weeks ago, I injured\
the muscles of my back.\
0:20\
So while I have delivered more than 100\
general conference addresses standing,\
0:27\
today I thought I would do so sitting.\
0:32\
I pray that the Spirit will carry my\
message into your hearts today.\
0:40\
I recently celebrated my 99th birthday\
0:43\
and thus commenced my 100th\
year of living.\
0:49\
I'm often asked the secret\
to living so long.\
0:54\
A better question would be, “What have I\
learned in nearly a century of living?”\
1:03\
Time today does not allow me to\
answer that question fully.\
1:07\
But may I share one of the most crucial\
lessons I have learned?\
1:15\
I have learned that Heavenly Father’s\
plan for us is fabulous,\
1:21\
that what we do in this life\
really matters, and that\
1:26\
the Savior’s Atonement is what makes\
our Father’s plan possible.\
1:34\
As I have wrestled with the intense\
pain caused by my recent injury,\
1:40\
I felt even deeper appreciation\
for Jesus Christ and\
1:46\
the incomprehensible\
1:48\
gift of His Atonement. Think of it.\
1:54\
The Savior suffered “pains\
and afflictions\
1:58\
and temptations of every kind” so that\
He can comfort us, heal us,\
2:05\
rescue us in times of need.\
2:10\
Jesus Christ described His experience\
in Gethsemane and on Calvary. Quote.\
2:18\
“Which suffering caused myself, even\
God, the greatest of all,\
2:24\
to tremble because of pain and to bleed\
at every pore.” Close quote.\
2:34\
My injury has caused me to reflect again\
and again on the greatness of\
2:41\
the Holy One of Israel.\
During my healing,\
2:46\
the Lord has manifested His divine power\
in peaceful and unmistakable ways.\
2:55\
Because of Jesus Christ’s\
infinite Atonement\
2:59\
our Heavenly Father’s plan\
is a perfect plan.\
3:05\
An understanding of God's fabulous plan\
takes the mystery out of life and\
3:11\
the uncertainty out of our future.\
3:15\
It allows each of us to choose how\
we will live here on Earth,\
3:21\
and where we will live forever.\
3:26\
The baseless notion that we should “eat,\
drink, and be merry for tomorrow\
3:31\
we die and it shall all be well with us”\
is one of the most absurd lies in\
3:38\
the universe. Here’s the great\
news of God’s plan:\
3:44\
the very things that will\
make your mortal life\
3:48\
the best it can be are exactly\
3:52\
the same things that will make your\
life throughout all eternity\
3:59\
the best it can be.\
4:03\
Today to assist you to qualify for the\
rich blessings Heavenly Father has\
4:09\
for you, I invite you to adopt the\
practice of thinking celestial.\
4:19\
Thinking celestial means being\
spiritually minded.\
4:26\
We learn from the Book of Mormon\
prophet Jacob that “to be spiritually\
4:30\
minded is life eternal.”\
4:37\
Mortality is a master class\
4:41\
in learning to choose the things\
of greatest eternal import.\
4:49\
Far too many people live as though\
this life is all there is.\
4:54\
However, your choices today will\
determine three things: where you will\
5:01\
live throughout all eternity,\
5:04\
the kind of body with which\
you will be resurrected,\
5:08\
and those with whom you will live\
forever. So think celestial.\
5:20\
In my first message as President\
of the Church,\
5:24\
I encouraged you to begin\
with the end in mind.\
5:29\
This means making the celestial\
kingdom your eternal goal.\
5:34\
And then carefully considering\
where each of your decisions\
5:40\
while here on earth will place\
you in the next world.\
5:46\
The Lord has clearly taught that only\
men and women who are sealed\
5:53\
as husband and wife in the temple\
5:57\
and who keep their covenants will be\
together throughout the eternities.\
6:04\
He said, quote,\
6:07\
“All covenants, contracts,\
bonds, obligations, oaths,\
6:15\
vows, performances, connections,\
6:18\
associations, or expectations that\
are not made and entered into and\
6:26\
sealed [in] the Holy Spirit of promise\
... have an end when men are dead.”\
6:35\
Close quote. Thus. If we unwisely\
choose to live telestial laws\
6:44\
now, we are choosing to be resurrected\
with a telestial body.\
6:51\
We are choosing not to live\
with our families forever.\
6:58\
So, my dear brothers and sisters,\
7:01\
how and where and with whom do you want\
to live forever? You get to choose.\
7:12\
When you make choices, I invite you to\
take the long view. An eternal view.\
7:20\
Put Jesus Christ first, because your\
eternal life is dependent upon your\
7:26\
faith in Him and in His Atonement.\
7:32\
It is also dependent upon your\
obedience to His laws.\
7:38\
Obedience paves the way for a joyful\
life for you today and\
7:44\
a grand eternal reward tomorrow.\
7:50\
When you are confronted with\
a dilemma, think celestial.\
7:56\
When tested by temptation,\
think celestial.\
8:03\
When life or loved ones let\
you down, think celestial.\
8:10\
When someone dies prematurely,\
think celestial.\
8:17\
When someone lingers with a devastating\
illness, think celestial.\
8:24\
When the pressures of life crowd in\
upon you, think celestial.\
8:32\
As you recover from an accident\
or injury, as I am doing now,\
8:38\
think celestial. As you focus\
on thinking celestial,\
8:44\
expect to encounter opposition.\
8:49\
Decades ago, a professional\
colleague criticized me\
8:53\
for having “too much temple” in me,\
8:57\
and more than one supervisor penalized\
me because of my faith.\
9:03\
I am convinced, however, that thinking\
celestial enhanced my career.\
9:12\
As you think celestial, your heart\
will gradually change.\
9:18\
You'll want to pray more often\
and more sincerely.\
9:25\
Please don't let your prayers\
sound like a shopping list.\
9:31\
The Lord's perspective transcends\
your mortal wisdom.\
9:37\
His response to your prayers\
may surprise you,\
9:42\
and will help you to think celestial.\
9:47\
Consider the Lord’s response to\
the Prophet Joseph Smith\
9:52\
when he pleaded for relief\
in Liberty jail.\
9:58\
The Lord taught the Prophet that his\
inhumane treatment would give him\
10:04\
experience and be for his good. “If thou\
endure it well,” the Lord promised.\
10:13\
“God shall exalt thee on high.”\
10:19\
The Lord was teaching Joseph to think\
celestial and to envision\
10:24\
an eternal reward rather than focus on\
the excruciating difficulties of\
10:29\
the day.\
10:32\
Our prayers can be—and should be—living\
discussions with our Heavenly Father.\
10:42\
As you think celestial, you will find\
yourself avoiding anything\
10:50\
that robs you of your agency.\
10:54\
Any addiction, be it gaming, gambling,\
debt, drugs, alcohol, anger,\
11:03\
pornography, sex, or even\
food offends God. Why?\
11:12\
Because you're obsession\
becomes your God.\
11:16\
You look to it rather than\
to Him for solace.\
11:25\
If you struggle with an addiction,\
11:28\
seek the spiritual and professional\
help you need.\
11:33\
Please do not let an obsession rob you\
of your freedom to follow God's\
11:40\
fabulous plan.\
11:44\
Thinking celestial will also help\
you obey the law of chastity.\
11:50\
Few things will complicate your life\
more quickly than violating this divine\
11:57\
law. For you who have made\
covenants with God,\
12:02\
Immorality is one of the quickest\
ways to lose your testimony.\
12:10\
Many of the adversary’s most relentless\
temptations involve violations of\
12:18\
moral purity. The power\
to create life is\
12:25\
the one privilege of godhood that\
Heavenly Father allows His mortal\
12:30\
children to exercise. Thus,\
12:34\
God set clear guidelines for the use\
of this living divine power.\
12:42\
Physical intimacy is only for a man and\
12:45\
a woman who are married to each other.\
12:50\
Much of the world does\
not believe this.\
12:53\
But public opinion is not\
the arbiter of truth.\
12:58\
The Lord has declared that no\
unchaste person will attain\
13:03\
the celestial kingdom.\
13:08\
So when you make decisions regarding\
morality, please think celestial.\
13:17\
And if you have been unchaste,\
I plead with you to repent.\
13:22\
Come unto Christ and receive His promise\
of complete forgiveness\
13:28\
as you fully repent of your sins.\
13:33\
As you think celestial, you will view\
trials and opposition in a new light.\
13:42\
When someone you love attacks truth,\
13:46\
think celestial and don't\
question your testimony.\
13:53\
The apostle Paul prophesied that “in the\
latter times some shall depart from\
14:02\
the faith, giving heed to seducing\
spirits and doctrines of devils.”\
14:13\
There is no end to the adversary’s\
deceptions. Please be prepared.\
14:21\
Never take counsel from those\
who do not believe.\
14:26\
Seek guidance from voices you can trust—\
from prophets, seers, and revelators,\
14:33\
and from the whisperings of the Holy\
Ghost who “will show unto you\
14:38\
the things what ye should do.”\
14:45\
Please do the spiritual work to increase\
your capacity to receive\
14:50\
personal revelation.\
14:54\
As you think celestial, your\
faith will increase.\
15:00\
When I was a young intern, my\
income was $15 a month.\
15:05\
One night, my wife Dantzel asked\
me if I were paying tithing\
15:10\
on that meager stipend. I was not.\
15:16\
I quickly repented and began paying the\
additional $1.50 in monthly tithing.\
15:26\
Was the Church any different because\
we increased our tithing?\
15:31\
Of course not. However, becoming\
a full tithe payer changed me.\
15:40\
That's when I learned that paying\
tithing is all about faith, not money.\
15:46\
As a full tithe payer, the windows\
of heaven began to open for me.\
15:52\
I attribute several subsequent\
professional opportunities to our\
15:57\
faithful payment of tithes.\
16:00\
Paying tithing requires faith, and it\
also builds faith in God and His Son,\
16:05\
Jesus Christ. Choosing to live a\
virtuous life in a sexualized,\
16:12\
politicized world builds faith.\
16:17\
Spending more time in the\
temple builds faith,\
16:22\
and your service and worship in\
16:24\
the temple will help you\
to think celestial.\
16:31\
The temple is a place of revelation.\
16:36\
There you are shown how to progress\
toward a celestial life.\
16:43\
There you are drawn closer\
to the Savior\
16:46\
and given greater access to His power.\
16:52\
There you are guided in solving\
the problems in your life,\
16:58\
even your most perplexing problems.\
17:02\
The ordinances and covenants of the\
temple are of eternal significance.\
17:10\
We continue to build more temples to\
make these sacred possibilities become\
17:16\
a reality in each of your lives.\
17:21\
We are grateful to announce our plans\
to build a temple in each of\
17:27\
the following 20 locations:\
17:32\
Savai’i, Samoa. Cancun,\
Mexico. Piura, Peru.\
17:40\
Huancayo, Peru. Vina del Mar, Chile.\
17:46\
Goiania, Brazil. Joao Pessoa, Brazil.\
17:51\
Calabar, Nigeria. Cape Coast, Ghana.\
Luanda, Angola. Muji Mai,\
18:01\
Democratic Republic of the Congo.\
Laoag, Philippines.\
18:08\
Osaka, Japan. Kahului, Maui, Hawaii.\
18:12\
Fairbanks, Alaska.\
Vancouver, Washington.\
18:20\
Colorado Springs, Colorado. Tulsa,\
Oklahoma. Roanoke, Virginia.\
18:28\
And Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.\
18:34\
The Lord is directing us to build these\
temples to help us think celestial.\
18:42\
God lives. Jesus is the Christ.\
18:46\
His Church has been restored to\
bless all of God’s children.\
18:52\
I so testify in the sacred name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
