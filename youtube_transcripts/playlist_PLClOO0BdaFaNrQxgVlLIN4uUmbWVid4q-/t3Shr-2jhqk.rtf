In 1907, a wealthy Englishman\
named George Herbert,\
0:06\
the fifth Earl of Carnarvon,\
0:08\
moved to Egypt and took up an\
interest in archeology.\
0:12\
He approached a well-known Egyptologist,\
Howard Carter,\
0:16\
and proposed a partnership.\
0:19\
Carter would oversee their\
archeological excavations\
0:22\
and Carnarvon would provide the funding.\
0:26\
Together, they successfully explored\
a variety of locations.\
0:31\
Then they received permission to\
excavate in the Valley of the Kings,\
0:36\
located near modern-day Luxor,\
0:38\
where the tombs of many pharaohs\
had been found.\
0:42\
They decided to look for the\
tomb of King Tutankhamun.\
0:48\
Tutankhamun had ascended to the throne\
of Egypt more than 3,000 years earlier\
0:52\
and reigned for 10 years before\
his unexpected death.\
0:57\
He was known to have been buried\
in the Valley of the Kings.\
1:00\
But the location of his\
tomb was unknown.\
1:04\
Carter and Carnarvon spent five\
years unsuccessfully searching\
1:10\
for Tutankhamun's tomb. Eventually,\
1:13\
Carnarvon informed Carter that he was\
finished with the fruitless quest.\
1:19\
Carter pleaded for just one\
more season of excavation,\
1:23\
and Carnarvon relented and\
agreed to the funding.\
1:27\
Carter realized that the entire\
floor of the Valley of\
1:31\
the Kings had been methodically\
excavated—\
1:35\
except the area of their own base camp.\
Within a few days of digging there,\
1:41\
they found the first steps\
leading down to the tomb.\
1:45\
When Carter eventually peered into the\
antechamber of Tutankhamun's tomb,\
1:50\
he saw gold everywhere. After three\
months of cataloging the contents of\
1:58\
the antechamber, they opened\
2:00\
the sealed burial chamber in February\
1923—100 years ago.\
2:06\
This was the most famous archeological\
find of the 20th century.\
2:11\
During those years of ineffectual\
searching,\
2:14\
Carter and Carnarvon had overlooked\
what was literally under their feet.\
2:21\
Some five centuries before\
the Savior’s birth\
2:24\
the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob\
referred to taking for granted\
2:29\
or undervaluing what’s nearby\
as “looking beyond the mark.”\
2:35\
Jacob foresaw that the people of\
Jerusalem wouldn't recognize\
2:39\
the promised Messiah when He came.\
2:42\
Jacob prophesied that they would\
be a “people [who] despised the words\
2:46\
of plainness, ... and [would seek]\
for things they could not understand.\
2:51\
Wherefore, because of their blindness,\
2:55\
which blindness [would come] by looking\
beyond the mark, they must needs fall.”\
3:01\
In other words, they would stumble.\
Jacob’s prediction proved accurate.\
3:08\
During Jesus’s mortal ministry, many\
looked beyond the mark, beyond Him.\
3:12\
They look past the Savior of the world.\
3:15\
Instead of recognizing His role in\
fulfilling Heavenly Father’s plan,\
3:20\
they condemned and crucified Him.\
3:24\
They looked and waited for someone\
else to bring them salvation.\
3:29\
Like those people in Jerusalem and\
like Carter and Carnarvon,\
3:34\
we, too, can be prone to\
look beyond the mark.\
3:39\
We need to guard against this tendency,\
3:41\
lest we miss Jesus Christ in our\
lives and fail to recognize\
3:47\
the many blessings He offers us.\
We need Him.\
3:52\
We’re counseled to “rely wholly upon the\
merits of him who is mighty to save.”\
3:57\
He is our mark. If we incorrectly\
imagine that there is a need\
4:02\
for something beyond what He offers,\
4:05\
we deny or diminish the scope and\
power He can have in our lives.\
4:11\
He has claimed the rights of mercy\
and extends that mercy to us.\
4:16\
He’s the ultimate “source [to whom we\
should] look for a remission of [our]\
4:21\
sins.” He is our Advocate with the\
Father and champions what\
4:24\
the Father has wanted all along—\
for us to return to Him\
4:29\
as inheritors in His kingdom.\
4:32\
We need to, in the words\
of the prophet Alma,\
4:35\
“cast about [our] eyes and\
begin to believe in\
4:39\
the Son of God, that he will come\
to redeem his people,\
4:43\
and that he shall suffer and\
die to atone for [our] sins;\
4:47\
and that he shall rise\
again from the dead,\
4:49\
which shall bring to pass\
the resurrection.”\
4:52\
Jesus Christ is our treasure.\
4:56\
The Savior has given us many ways\
to focus on Him intentionally,\
5:02\
including the daily opportunity\
to repent.\
5:07\
Sometimes we undervalue how great\
this offered blessing is.\
5:12\
When I was eight years old, I\
was baptized by my father.\
5:17\
Afterwards, I held his hand as we're\
going to cross a busy street.\
5:22\
I wasn't paying attention and stepped\
from the curb just as\
5:26\
a big truck came rumbling by.\
5:29\
My father jerked me back out of\
the street and onto the curb.\
5:34\
Had he not done so, I'd have\
been hit by the truck.\
5:39\
Knowing my own mischievous nature\
I thought,\
5:44\
“Maybe it would have been better for\
me to be killed by the truck\
5:47\
because I’ll never be as clean as I\
am now, right after my baptism.”\
5:53\
As an eight-year-old, I had\
mistakenly presumed that\
5:57\
the water of baptism washed\
away sins. Not so.\
6:02\
In the years since my baptism,\
6:05\
I've learned that sins are cleansed by\
6:07\
the power of Jesus Christ through His\
atoning sacrifice as we make and keep\
6:13\
the baptismal covenant. Then, through\
the gift of repentance,\
6:17\
we can remain clean. I've also learned\
that the sacrament brings a powerful,\
6:23\
virtuous cycle into our lives, enabling\
us to retain a remission of our sins.\
6:30\
Just like the treasure that was under\
the feet of Carter and Carnarvon,\
6:35\
the treasured blessings of\
6:36\
the sacrament are available to us each\
time we attend sacrament meeting.\
6:41\
We're promised that the Holy Ghost will\
be our constant companion if we\
6:45\
approach the sacrament the way a\
new convert approaches baptism\
6:49\
and confirmation with a broken\
heart and contrite spirit and\
6:54\
a determination to live up to\
that baptismal covenant.\
6:59\
The Holy Ghost blesses us with\
His sanctifying power\
7:02\
so that we can always retain\
a remission of our sins,\
7:06\
week in and week out. Our spiritual\
foundation is strengthened through\
7:12\
repentance and by conscientiously\
preparing for and worthily partaking of\
7:18\
the sacrament. Only with a robust\
spiritual foundation can we handle\
7:23\
the metaphorical rain, wind, and floods\
that confront us in our lives.\
7:30\
Conversely, our spiritual foundation is\
weakened when we voluntarily skip\
7:36\
sacrament meeting or when we don’t focus\
on the Savior during the sacrament.\
7:42\
We may unintentionally “withdraw\
[ourselves] from the Spirit of the Lord,\
7:47\
that it may have no place in [us]\
to guide [us] in wisdom’s path,\
7:51\
that [we] may be blessed, prospered,\
and preserved.”\
7:57\
When we have the Holy Ghost with us,\
we will be inspired and guided to make\
8:02\
and keep other covenants such\
as those we make in temples.\
8:08\
Doing so deepens our relationship\
with God.\
8:13\
You may have noticed that many new\
temples have been announced in recent\
8:17\
years, bringing temples ever\
closer to members.\
8:23\
Paradoxically, as temples\
become more accessible,\
8:28\
it may be easier for us to become more\
casual about temple attendance.\
8:35\
When temples are distant,\
8:36\
we plan our time and resources to travel\
to the temple to worship there.\
8:41\
We prioritize these journeys.\
8:44\
With a temple close at hand,\
8:47\
it can be easy to let little things\
get in the way of attending,\
8:51\
saying to ourselves, “Well, I’ll\
just go another time.”\
8:57\
Living close to a temple does\
bring greater flexibility\
9:01\
in scheduling time in the temple,\
9:02\
but that very flexibility can make it\
easier to take the temple for granted.\
9:10\
When we do, we miss the mark,\
9:14\
undervaluing the opportunity to draw\
closer to the Savior in His holy house.\
9:20\
Our commitment to attend should\
be at least as strong when\
9:24\
the temple is nearby as\
when it's distant.\
9:28\
After Carter and Carnarvon excavated\
elsewhere in the Valley of the\
9:32\
Kings looking for Tutankhamun’s tomb,\
they realized their oversight.\
9:39\
We don't need to labor unsuccessfully,\
9:41\
as they did for a time,\
to find our treasure.\
9:45\
Nor need we seek counsel from exotic\
sources prizing the novelty of\
9:50\
the source and thinking such counsel\
will be more enlightened than that\
9:55\
which we can receive from\
a humble prophet of God.\
10:00\
As recorded in the Old Testament, when\
Naaman sought a cure for his leprosy,\
10:06\
he was indignant at being asked\
to dip himself seven times in\
10:11\
a nearby ordinary river. But\
he was persuaded to follow\
10:16\
the prophet Elisha’s counsel,\
10:18\
rather than rely on his own preconceived\
notions of how\
10:23\
the miracle should occur. As a result,\
Naaman was healed.\
10:30\
When we trust God's prophet on the earth\
today and act on His counsel,\
10:36\
we will find happiness, and we, too, can\
be healed. We need to look no further.\
10:45\
Brothers and sisters, I encourage\
you to remember and always focus\
10:51\
on Jesus Christ. He’s our\
Savior and Redeemer,\
10:56\
the “mark” to whom we should look,\
and our greatest treasure.\
11:02\
As you come to Him, you’ll be rewarded\
with strength to face life’s challenges,\
11:08\
courage to do what’s right,\
11:10\
and the ability to fulfill your\
mission in mortality.\
11:15\
Treasure the opportunity to repent,\
11:18\
the privilege of partaking\
of the sacrament,\
11:21\
the blessing of making and\
keeping temple covenants,\
11:25\
the delight of worshiping in the\
temple and the joy of having\
11:31\
a living prophet. I bear my solemn\
and sure witness that God\
11:37\
the Eternal Father is our Heavenly\
Father and that He lives.\
11:43\
Jesus is the Christ. He’s our kind,\
wise, heavenly friend.\
11:51\
And this is His Restored Church. Thank\
you for your faith and faithfulness.\
11:58\
I pray that you'll be blessed,\
12:01\
prospered, and preserved. In the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
