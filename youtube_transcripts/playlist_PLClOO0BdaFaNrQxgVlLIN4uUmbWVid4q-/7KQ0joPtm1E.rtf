One day in the spring of 1945, a young\
man awoke in a military hospital.\
0:08\
He was fortunate to be alive. He'd\
been shot just behind the ear.\
0:13\
But doctors had operated and he could\
now walk and talk normally.\
0:18\
Tragically, the bullet had damaged\
0:21\
the part of his brain that\
recognized faces.\
0:24\
He now looked at his wife without\
a spark of recognition.\
0:29\
He couldn't recognize his own mother.\
0:31\
Even the face in the mirror\
was foreign to him.\
0:34\
He couldn't tell if it\
was a man or a woman.\
0:37\
He had become face blind, a condition\
that affects millions of people.\
0:43\
People who are severely face blind try\
to identify others by memorizing rules.\
0:49\
A rule for recognizing a daughter by\
the pattern of her freckles or\
0:54\
a friend by her shuffling gait. Here's\
a second story closer to home.\
1:00\
As a young boy, I often saw\
my mom as the rulemaker.\
1:05\
She decided when I\
could play and when\
1:09\
I had to go to bed or worse,\
pull weeds in the yard.\
1:12\
She obviously loved me, but\
too often and to my shame,\
1:17\
I saw her only as She\
Who Must Be Obeyed.\
1:21\
Only years later did I come to\
see her as a real person.\
1:27\
I'm embarrassed that I never really\
noticed her sacrifice or wondered why\
1:33\
for years she only ever wore the\
same two old skirts while\
1:38\
I got new school clothes.\
1:40\
Or at the end of the day,\
1:42\
why she was so tired and eager\
for me to go to bed early.\
1:48\
Perhaps you've noticed that these two\
stories are really one story.\
1:52\
For too many years I was,\
in effect, face blind.\
1:56\
I failed to see my mom as a real person.\
2:00\
I saw her rules, but I didn't\
see in them her love.\
2:05\
Now I tell you these two stories\
to make one point.\
2:09\
I suspect you know someone,\
2:12\
perhaps you are someone, who suffers\
from a kind of spiritual face blindness.\
2:20\
You may struggle to see God\
as a loving Father.\
2:25\
You may look heavenward and see not\
the face of love and mercy,\
2:32\
but a thicket of rules through\
which you must wend your way.\
2:35\
Perhaps you believe God\
rules in His heavens,\
2:38\
speaks through His prophets\
and loves your sister,\
2:42\
but secretly wonder whether\
He loves you.\
2:46\
Perhaps you have felt the\
iron rod in your hand,\
2:49\
but not yet felt your Savior’s\
love to which it leads.\
2:54\
I suspect you know people like this,\
2:55\
because for a long time I\
was someone like this.\
2:59\
I was spiritually face blind.\
3:03\
I thought my life was\
about following rules\
3:07\
and measuring up to abstract standards.\
3:10\
I knew God loved you perfectly,\
but I didn't feel it myself.\
3:15\
I'm afraid I thought more about getting\
into heaven than being with my\
3:19\
Heavenly Father. If you, like me,\
can sometimes only lip sync\
3:26\
but not sing the song of redeeming love,\
what can we do?\
3:31\
The answer, as President Nelson\
reminds us, is always Jesus.\
3:36\
And that is very good news. There's\
a short verse in John that I love.\
3:42\
It tells of a group of outsiders who\
make their way to a disciple with\
3:45\
an important request. Sir, they say,\
we would like to see Jesus.\
3:51\
That is what we all want.\
3:53\
We want to see Jesus for who\
He is and to feel His love.\
3:58\
This should be the reason for most\
of what we do in the Church\
4:01\
and certainly of every\
sacrament meeting.\
4:04\
If you're ever wondering what\
kind of lesson to teach,\
4:07\
what kind of meeting to plan,\
4:09\
and whether to just give up on the\
deacons and play dodgeball,\
4:13\
you might take this verse as your guide.\
4:16\
Will this help people see\
and love Jesus Christ?\
4:21\
If not, maybe try something else.\
4:26\
When I realized that I was\
spiritually face blind,\
4:29\
that I saw rules but not the\
face of the Father’s mercy,\
4:34\
I knew it wasn’t the Church’s fault.\
It wasn’t God’s.\
4:38\
And it didn't mean everything was lost.\
It's something we all have to learn.\
4:43\
Even the early witnesses to\
4:45\
the Resurrection often came\
face-to-face with the resurrected Lord,\
4:51\
but did not recognize Him.\
4:54\
From the garden tomb to\
the shores of Galilee,\
4:56\
His first followers saw Jesus standing\
and knew not that it was Jesus.\
5:02\
They had to learn to recognize him.\
And so do we.\
5:07\
When I realized I was spiritually\
face blind,\
5:10\
I started to follow Mormon's\
counsel to pray with all\
5:13\
the energy of heart to be filled with\
the love promised His disciples,\
5:18\
my love for Him, and His love for me.\
5:22\
And to see Him as He is\
and have this hope.\
5:26\
I prayed for years to be able to follow\
the first great commandment,\
5:31\
to love God and to feel that first great\
truth that God loves us with all\
5:38\
of His heart, might, mind, and strength.\
5:41\
I read and reread and reread\
the four Gospels,\
5:45\
this time reading not to extract rules,\
but to see who He is and what He loves.\
5:52\
And in time I was swept away by the\
river of love that flowed from Him.\
5:58\
Jesus announced at the outset that He\
had come to heal the brokenhearted,\
6:03\
to proclaim liberty to the captives, and\
the recovery of sight to the blind.\
6:09\
This wasn’t just a to do list or good\
PR, it is the shape of His love.\
6:15\
Open the Gospels at random.\
6:17\
On almost every page we see Him caring\
for people who suffer socially,\
6:23\
spiritually, physically. He touches\
people considered polluted and unclean,\
6:28\
and He feeds the hungry. What is\
your favorite story of Jesus?\
6:35\
I suspect it shows the Son of\
God reaching out to embrace\
6:38\
or offer hope to someone on\
the margins: the leper,\
6:42\
the hated Samaritan, the accused\
and scandalous sinner,\
6:46\
or the national enemy. That\
kind of grace is amazing.\
6:51\
Try writing down every time He praises\
or heals or eats with an outsider\
6:57\
and you will run low on ink\
before you leave Luke.\
7:02\
As I saw this, my heart leapt\
in loving recognition,\
7:07\
and I began to feel that He might love\
me. As President Nelson taught,\
7:12\
The more you learn about the Savior,\
7:15\
the easier it will be to trust in\
His mercy and His infinite love,\
7:21\
and the more you will trust and\
love your Heavenly Father.\
7:26\
Elder Holland has taught us that\
Jesus came to show us who\
7:30\
and what God our eternal Father is like,\
7:32\
how completely devoted He is to His\
children in every age and nation.\
7:38\
Paul says, God is the Father of all\
mercies and the God of all comfort.\
7:46\
If you see Him differently,\
please keep trying.\
7:50\
Prophets invite us to seek His face.\
7:53\
I take this as a reminder that we\
worship our Father and not a formula.\
7:57\
That we’re not finished until we see\
Jesus as the face of our Father’s love\
8:01\
and follow Him and not just His rules.\
8:05\
When prophets and apostles\
talk of covenants,\
8:07\
they aren't like coaches yelling out\
from red velvet bleachers telling us\
8:11\
to try harder. They want us to see our\
covenants are fundamentally about\
8:16\
relationships and can be a cure\
for spiritual face blindness.\
8:22\
They’re not rules to earn His love.\
He already loves you perfectly.\
8:27\
Our challenge is to understand and\
shape our life to that love.\
8:32\
We try to see through our covenants as\
if through a window to the face of\
8:38\
the Father’s mercy behind. Covenants\
are the shape of God’s embrace.\
8:45\
Finally, we learn to see\
Him by serving Him.\
8:49\
For how knoweth a man the master\
whom he has not served.\
8:55\
A few years ago, I got a calling\
I didn't feel up to.\
8:58\
I awoke early, nervous, but\
with a phrase in mind\
9:02\
I had not heard before that to serve\
in this church is to stand in\
9:08\
the river of God’s love\
for His children.\
9:11\
This church is a work party of people\
with picks and shovels trying to clear\
9:16\
the channel for the river of God’s love\
to reach His children at the end of\
9:20\
the row. Whoever you are,\
9:24\
whatever your past, there is room\
for you in this church.\
9:29\
Grab a pick and shovel\
and join the team.\
9:32\
Help carry His love to His children.\
And some of it will splash on you.\
9:36\
Let us seek His loving face,\
His covenant embrace,\
9:41\
and then join arm in arm\
with His children\
9:43\
and together we will sing, Redeemer\
of Israel, restore, my dear Savior,\
9:48\
the light of Thy face, Thy soul\
cheering comfort in part,\
9:53\
And let the sweet longing for Thy holy\
place bring hope to my desolate heart.\
9:59\
May we seek His loving face.\
10:00\
And then be vessels of His mercy to His\
children in the name of Jesus Christ,\
10:05\
amen.\
