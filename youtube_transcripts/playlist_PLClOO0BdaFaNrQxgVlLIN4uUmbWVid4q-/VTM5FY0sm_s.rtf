My brothers and sisters, I’m honored\
to be with you this morning.\
0:07\
I pray that the Lord will\
bless me.\
0:11\
My eyes aren't what they used to be.\
0:17\
I went and saw the eye doctor and I said\
“I can’t see the teleprompter.”\
0:22\
He said, “Well, your eyes are old and\
they’re not going to change.”\
0:26\
So I’ll do the best I can.\
0:31\
I'd like to share with you some things\
that have been in my mind.\
0:39\
I have seemed to have\
the Prophet Joseph\
0:47\
in my mind the last few months.\
0:55\
I have even, when I have\
sat and contemplated\
1:01\
his divine and—not divine, but his\
glorious responsibility and\
1:09\
becoming the prophet of this,\
1:13\
the dispensation of the\
fulness of times.\
1:17\
I think how grateful we\
are as members of\
1:21\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints that Joseph Smith, a boy\
1:34\
who desired to know what he needed\
to do to have his sins forgiven,\
1:42\
and found the courage\
1:45\
to go into a grove of trees near\
his home in Palmyra, New York.\
1:55\
And there to kneel in prayer.\
And by his own statement,\
2:02\
to pray out loud for the first time.\
2:08\
On that occasion\
2:11\
as Joseph on his knees in what we call\
2:16\
the sacred grove, the heavens opened.\
2:26\
Two personages, brighter than the\
noonday sun, appeared before him.\
2:38\
One spoke to him and said, “Joseph,\
2:44\
this is my Beloved Son. Hear Him.”\
2:54\
Thus began the Restoration\
of the fulness of\
3:02\
the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ.\
3:08\
As Jesus, our Savior and our Redeemer,\
spoke to the boy Joseph,\
3:18\
and opened up this dispensation of time\
3:25\
that we now live in.\
3:29\
We sing the song “Praise to the man\
who communed with Jehovah.”\
3:38\
Joseph Smith.\
3:41\
We thank the Lord for Joseph Smith\
3:46\
and for his courage to go into\
that grove of trees in 1820\
3:55\
near his home in Palmyra, New York.\
4:00\
And I’ve been thinking about just\
all of the marvelous things,\
4:05\
brothers and sisters, that we know\
and all the things that we have.\
4:12\
The understanding of the purpose\
of life. Who we are.\
4:21\
We know who God is. We know who\
the Savior is. Because\
4:30\
we have Joseph, who went\
into a grove of trees\
4:37\
as a boy,\
4:41\
seeking really the forgiveness\
for his sins.\
4:48\
I think it's one of the most glorious\
4:51\
and wonderful things that anybody\
in this world can know,\
4:57\
that our Heavenly Father and\
the Lord Jesus Christ\
5:02\
have revealed themselves\
5:06\
in this latter day, and that Joseph\
has been raised up to restore\
5:15\
the fullness of the everlasting\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
5:23\
My beloved brothers and sisters.\
5:26\
My testimony to you this morning\
is how abundantly blessed\
5:33\
we are to know\
5:38\
all that we know\
5:42\
because we have Joseph Smith,\
5:47\
the prophet of this last\
dispensation of time.\
5:56\
We have the Book of Mormon.\
5:59\
What a marvelous, wonderful gift\
the Book of Mormon is to\
6:05\
the membership of the Church.\
6:08\
Another witness, another testament\
that Jesus is the Christ.\
6:15\
We have it because Joseph was\
worthy to go get the plates,\
6:25\
was inspired by heaven to translate\
them by the gift and power of God.\
6:36\
And to give it to the\
6:39\
world, another\
6:43\
testament that Jesus is the Christ.\
6:50\
So my message this morning is simple.\
6:58\
It’s deep.\
7:01\
And it’s full of love for\
the Prophet Joseph Smith.\
7:08\
And for all of those, my brothers\
and sisters, who have\
7:15\
and were willing to sustain\
him in his youth.\
7:22\
I would like to pay tribute this\
morning to his mother.\
7:29\
I’ve always thought\
7:32\
how wonderful it was that\
Lucy Mack Smith,\
7:37\
when Joseph came from\
that experience in\
7:41\
the Sacred Grove and told his\
mother what had happened,\
7:47\
that she believed him.\
7:55\
I'm grateful for his father. And\
his brothers and his sisters.\
8:03\
And his family that sustained him in\
this tremendous responsibility\
8:12\
that the Lord placed upon him\
to become the prophet,\
8:19\
to restore the fulness of\
8:23\
the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ\
once again upon the earth.\
8:30\
So my testimony this morning is\
that I know that Jesus Christ\
8:39\
is the Savior and Redeemer of the world.\
8:43\
I also know that our Heavenly Father\
and the Lord Jesus Christ appeared\
8:53\
and spoke to Joseph and prepared\
him to become the prophet,\
9:02\
to restore the fulness of the\
everlasting gospel once again upon\
9:08\
the earth.\
9:11\
I marvel, and I’m sure that many of\
you do too, at how blessed we are\
9:21\
to know what we know about our purpose\
in life. Why we are here.\
9:30\
What we should be trying to do and\
accomplish in our daily lives.\
9:37\
We’re in the process of trying to\
prepare ourselves one day at\
9:42\
a time to be a little better,\
be a little kinder,\
9:48\
be a little more prepared for that\
day when it will surely come,\
9:55\
when we shall pass back into\
9:58\
the presence of our Heavenly Father\
and the Lord Jesus Christ.\
10:07\
That's getting a little closer\
for me. I'll soon be 95.\
10:14\
My children tell me they think I'm\
a lot older than that some days,\
10:18\
but that's okay. I'm doing\
the best I can.\
10:26\
But in 50 years, brothers and sisters,\
10:31\
I’ve had the privilege to cover\
the world in my assignment\
10:40\
as a General Authority of the Church.\
10:46\
It's been a wonderful blessing.\
10:51\
There's almost, I think almost\
all the parts of\
10:55\
the world I've got pretty close to.\
10:58\
I’ve met with members of the\
Church all over the world.\
11:04\
Oh, how I love you. What a glorious\
experience that’s been\
11:10\
to look into your faces,\
11:12\
be in your presence and feel your love\
that you have for the Lord and for\
11:19\
the Restoration of the gospel\
of Jesus Christ.\
11:24\
May our Heavenly Father watch over us\
now and bless all the proceedings of\
11:31\
the conference. May we have\
the Spirit of the Lord\
11:36\
well up in our hearts\
and may our love for\
11:41\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
and our beloved Savior,\
11:48\
the Lord Jesus Christ, increase.\
11:52\
And our commitment to serve Him and\
to strive to keep His commandments\
11:59\
and try to be more like Him\
12:02\
be a result of our attending\
general conference.\
12:09\
So wherever you are in this world,\
may God bless you.\
12:16\
May the Spirit of the Lord be with us.\
12:19\
May we feel the power of heaven\
12:24\
as we worship together in this\
session of conference.\
12:29\
I leave you my witness and testimony\
that I know that Jesus is the Christ.\
12:38\
He is our Savior, our Redeemer.\
He is our best friend.\
12:47\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
