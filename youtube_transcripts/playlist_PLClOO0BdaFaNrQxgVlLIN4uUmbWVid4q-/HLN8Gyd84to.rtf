At baptism, one of the promises that we\
make is that we are willing to take\
0:08\
upon us the name of Jesus Christ.\
0:12\
My purpose today is to remind us that\
we can show God that we take\
0:18\
the name of His Son upon ourselves by\
bearing testimony in word and deed—\
0:24\
and as often as we can—that\
Jesus is the Christ.\
0:32\
When ministering to and teaching\
the people in the Americas\
0:36\
after His resurrection,\
the Savior declared:\
0:40\
“Have they not read the scriptures,\
which say you must take upon you\
0:45\
the name of Christ,\
0:48\
which is my name? For by this name\
shall ye be called at the last day,\
0:56\
and whoso taketh upon him my name\
and endureth to the end,\
1:01\
the same shall be saved\
at the last day.”\
1:06\
President Russell M. Nelson has\
taught us that, quote,\
1:11\
“Taking the Savior’s name upon\
us includes declaring\
1:16\
and witnessing to others—through our\
actions and our words—that Jesus is\
1:22\
the Christ.” As members of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\
1:30\
we have the blessing and privilege\
to stand as witnesses of\
1:34\
the Lord in His name everywhere we are.\
1:39\
As we strive to live our lives in\
harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christ,\
1:44\
our conduct will be a living testimony\
of our Redeemer and His name.\
1:53\
Moreover, we witness of Christ in word\
by sharing with others what we believe,\
2:01\
feel, or know of Jesus Christ.\
2:06\
When we humbly share our testimony of\
the Lord through our words and actions,\
2:12\
the Holy Ghost confirms to those\
with real intent, open hearts,\
2:17\
and willing minds that Jesus\
is indeed the Christ.\
2:26\
I would like to share two recent\
2:29\
and inspiring examples of members\
who show God that they take\
2:35\
the name of Jesus Christ upon\
themselves by talking of Him\
2:40\
and bearing pure witness of the\
Lord in church meetings.\
2:46\
First example, when my wife, Elaine,\
and I went to Spain in 2022,\
2:53\
we attended Sunday meetings in a\
small unit of the Church there.\
2:58\
As I sat on the stand and my\
wife in the congregation,\
3:02\
I noticed that she sat\
by an older woman.\
3:06\
When the sacrament meeting ended,\
3:09\
I walked towards Elaine and asked her\
to introduce me to her new friend.\
3:16\
She did so and indicated\
that this woman,\
3:20\
who was not a member of the Church,\
3:22\
had been visiting the church\
for about two years.\
3:28\
When I heard that, I asked this God-\
fearing woman what made her come back\
3:34\
and attend our meetings\
for such an extended period?\
3:39\
The woman lovingly replied,\
3:42\
“I love to come here because you speak\
of Jesus Christ in your meetings.”\
3:51\
Clearly, members of the Church\
in that unit in Spain talked,\
3:57\
taught, and testified of Christ\
in their meetings.\
4:02\
Second example, after serving\
in the Brazil area,\
4:07\
a new assignment came to serve\
at Church headquarters.\
4:11\
When we moved to Salt Lake City at\
the end of July of this year,\
4:15\
we attended Sunday meetings at\
our new and wonderful ward.\
4:20\
One of these meetings was a fast\
4:22\
and testimony meeting. After reverently\
partaking of the sacrament,\
4:29\
members stood up and bore heartfelt\
testimonies of the Savior,\
4:35\
one after the other. The\
meeting was centered\
4:40\
on Jesus Christ, and we could\
palpably feel the Spirit.\
4:46\
We were edified and our faith\
was strengthened.\
4:51\
If friends of the Church\
honestly seeking\
4:54\
the truth had been at that meeting,\
4:57\
they would have recognized that this\
is the Church of Jesus Christ.\
5:05\
What a blessing to see that our church\
meetings are choice opportunities\
5:10\
for us to testify of Christ\
5:13\
and signal to God that we rejoice in\
taking His Son’s name upon us.\
5:19\
Now, let me mention a powerful\
example of taking\
5:24\
the name of Jesus Christ upon us by\
bearing testimony of Him through\
5:30\
actions. Last August, I accompanied\
Elder Jonathan Schmitt to\
5:36\
the open house of the Feather River\
California Temple in Yuba City.\
5:41\
There I had the blessing of guiding\
groups on a tour of the temple.\
5:46\
One of these groups included\
a member of the Church,\
5:48\
Virgil Atkinson, and seven\
friends of other faiths.\
5:53\
Towards the end of the visit\
in a temple sealing room,\
5:56\
Brother Atkinson was emotional\
as he expressed his love\
6:00\
for his friends who had come to\
6:03\
the temple that day. Almost immediately\
after he had done so,\
6:08\
a woman in the group stood up and said,\
“We all love Virgil.\
6:13\
He has never imposed his faith on us,\
but he's not shy about it either.\
6:18\
He just lives what he believes.”\
6:22\
Over the years, Brother Atkinson's\
Christlike living served as\
6:26\
a powerful testimony to his friends.\
6:29\
His example is strong evidence that\
he has taken upon himself\
6:34\
the name of Christ. In conclusion,\
6:37\
let me share the lesson I learned about\
how to take upon us the name of Christ\
6:42\
and testify of Him by using the\
correct name of the Church.\
6:47\
President Nelson, God’s living prophet,\
6:50\
in 2018, in a general conference\
address titled “The Correct Name of\
6:56\
the Church,” said, “It is a correction.\
It is the command of the Lord.\
7:01\
Joseph Smith did not name the\
Church restored through him.\
7:05\
Neither did Mormon. It was the\
Savior Himself who said,\
7:10\
’For thus shall my church be called\
7:12\
in the last days, even The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.’”\
7:19\
We all left general conference that day\
committed and determined to follow\
7:24\
the prophet and to use the revealed\
name of the Church\
7:28\
from then on. I really watched\
myself to make sure I used\
7:33\
the correct name of the Church.\
The first few times,\
7:36\
I had to be very cautious and not allow\
myself to go back to the old ways.\
7:42\
After the first attempts,\
7:44\
I felt more comfortable about using\
the revealed name of the Church.\
7:49\
I admit that many times I would speak\
the name of the Church quickly.\
7:55\
I felt concerned that people\
would not pay attention to\
7:58\
the Church’s full name and that\
they might think it to be a bit long.\
8:03\
However, I later recognized\
or realized that speaking\
8:08\
the full name of the Church with intent\
gave me valuable opportunities to\
8:14\
speak the name of Jesus Christ\
and in fact bear testimony of\
8:18\
the Savior by declaring His name\
in the name of His Church.\
8:25\
I also noticed that when I\
spoke the correct name of\
8:29\
the Church with others, I more\
frequently remembered Jesus Christ\
8:34\
and felt His influence in my life.\
8:38\
By following the prophet,\
8:40\
we can all learn to testify more\
of Jesus Christ by using\
8:44\
the correct name of the Church,\
8:46\
thus taking upon us more fully\
the name of the Lord.\
8:51\
Now, this Sabbath morning,\
I gladly testify\
8:56\
that President Nelson is God’s\
living prophet and that\
9:01\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints is Christ’s restored Church.\
9:10\
I humbly witness of the Son\
of God and His divinity.\
9:15\
He is God’s Firstborn and Only Begotten\
Son, our Savior and Redeemer,\
9:21\
the Emmanuel. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
