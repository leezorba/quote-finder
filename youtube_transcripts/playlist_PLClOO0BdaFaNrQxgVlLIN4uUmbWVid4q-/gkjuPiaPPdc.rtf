Dear brothers and sisters,\
0:04\
this is The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
0:09\
What a joy it is to be gathered\
as His Church!\
0:13\
I am thankful that President Russell\
M. Nelson has reminded us to use\
0:18\
the correct name of the\
Lord's Church often\
0:21\
so that we remember whose Church this\
is and whose teachings we follow.\
0:27\
President Nelson has stated,\
“In coming days, we will see\
0:31\
the greatest manifestations\
of the Savior’s power that\
0:35\
the world has ever seen. ... He will\
bestow countless blessings,\
0:40\
privileges, and miracles\
upon the faithful.”\
0:44\
One of the greatest privileges\
for me and my wife, Renee,\
0:47\
is to meet with the Saints where we\
serve. We hear their stories,\
0:54\
we witness their losses,\
we share their grief,\
0:57\
and we rejoice with their success.\
0:59\
We have witnessed many of the\
blessings and miracles that\
1:03\
the Savior has bestowed\
upon the faithful.\
1:06\
We have met people who have gone\
through the impossible,\
1:09\
who have suffered the unthinkable.\
1:11\
We have seen the manifestation\
of the Savior's power in\
1:14\
a widow who lost her husband while they\
were on the Lord's errand in Bolivia.\
1:19\
We have seen it in a young woman in\
Argentina who was pushed under a train\
1:25\
and lost her leg just because someone\
wanted to steal her cell phone.\
1:30\
And in her single father,\
1:32\
who now must pick up the pieces and\
strengthen his daughter after such\
1:36\
an unexplainable act of cruelty.\
1:40\
We have seen it in the families\
that lost their homes\
1:43\
and every possession during fires in\
Chile just two days before Christmas\
1:48\
in 2022. We have seen it in those who\
suffer after a traumatic divorce\
1:55\
and in those who are\
innocent victims of abuse.\
1:59\
What gives them the power to\
go through hard things?\
2:03\
What gives an extra layer of strength\
to go on when everything seems lost?\
2:09\
I have found that the source of that\
strength is faith in Jesus Christ\
2:15\
as we intentionally seek to come\
unto Him each and every day.\
2:20\
The Prophet Jacob taught: “And\
2:22\
he cometh unto the world that he may\
save all men if they will hearken\
2:27\
unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth\
the pains of all men,\
2:32\
yea, the pains of every living creature,\
both men,\
2:35\
women, and children, who belong\
to the family of Adam.”\
2:39\
At times, having faith in Jesus Christ\
may seem like something impossible,\
2:45\
almost unattainable. We may think that\
coming unto Christ requires a strength,\
2:51\
power, and perfection we don’t\
have, and we just can’t find\
2:55\
the energy to do it all. But what\
2:58\
I have learned from all these people is\
that faith in Jesus Christ is what\
3:02\
gives us the energy to\
begin the journey.\
3:05\
Sometimes we may think, “I need to fix\
my life before I come to Jesus,”\
3:10\
but the truth is that we come to Jesus\
to fix our life through Him.\
3:15\
We don't come to Jesus because\
we are perfect.\
3:18\
We come to Him because we are flawed,\
and in Him we can be perfected.\
3:23\
How do we begin exercising a little\
bit of faith every day?\
3:27\
For me, it begins in the morning. When\
3:30\
I wake up, instead of looking\
at my phone,\
3:34\
I say a prayer—even a simple prayer.\
Then I read a scripture.\
3:39\
This helps me with my weekly covenant\
that I\
3:43\
make as I partake of the sacrament\
3:46\
“to always remember him.”\
3:48\
When I begin my day with a\
prayer and a scripture,\
3:52\
I can “remember Him” when\
I do look at my phone.\
3:56\
I can “remember Him” when I face\
problems and conflicts, and\
4:00\
I try to face them like Jesus would.\
4:03\
When I “remember Him,” I feel a\
desire to change, to repent.\
4:07\
I find the source of energy\
to keep my covenants,\
4:11\
and I feel the influence of\
the Holy Ghost in my life\
4:14\
“and keep His commandments, which he has\
given [me], that [I] may have His\
4:19\
Spirit.” It helps me to endure to the\
end, or at least to the end of the day!\
4:24\
And in those days that I fail\
to remember Him all day,\
4:28\
He is still there, loving me\
and telling me, “It is okay.\
4:33\
You can try again tomorrow.”\
4:36\
Although we are imperfect at remembering\
Him, our loving\
4:40\
Heavenly Father never\
fails to remember us.\
4:43\
One of the mistake we often make is\
to think that keeping covenants or\
4:48\
the promises we make to God is somehow\
a transaction we make with Him:\
4:53\
I obey and He protects me from anything\
bad ever happening to me. I\
4:58\
pay my tithing and I will never lose my\
job or the fire will not burn my house.\
5:03\
But then when things don’t go as we\
expected, we cry unto the Lord,\
5:08\
“Carest thou not that I perish?” Our\
covenants are not merely transactional;\
5:14\
they are transformational.\
5:16\
Through my covenants, I receive the\
sanctifying, strengthening power of\
5:21\
Jesus Christ, which allows me to become\
5:23\
a new person, to forgive what\
seems unforgivable,\
5:28\
to overcome the impossible.\
5:31\
Intentionally remembering Jesus\
Christ always is powerful.\
5:35\
It gives me added strength to “keep His\
commandments, which He has given [me].”\
5:41\
It helps me to be nicer, to smile for\
no reason, to be a peacemaker,\
5:46\
to avoid conflict, to let\
God prevail in my life.\
5:51\
When our pain or the pain of someone we\
love is so much that we can’t bear it,\
5:57\
remembering Jesus Christ and coming\
unto Him can lighten the burden,\
6:02\
soften the heart, and ease the pain.\
6:06\
This is the power that enables\
6:08\
a father beyond his natural capacity\
to sustain his daughter through\
6:13\
the physical and emotional\
pain of losing her leg.\
6:16\
When Elder Soares visited\
Argentina last June\
6:19\
and asked Flavia about her tragic\
accident, she faithfully replied,\
6:24\
“I experienced turmoil, bitterness,\
anger, and hate when [this happened].\
6:29\
Something that helped me was not\
to ask ‘why me?’ but ‘what for?’\
6:35\
This was something that brought me\
closer to others and to the Lord. ...\
6:40\
Instead of distancing myself from Him,\
I had to cling to Him.”\
6:45\
President Nelson taught: “The reward\
6:47\
for keeping covenants with\
God is heavenly power—\
6:51\
power that strengthens us to\
withstand our trials,\
6:54\
temptations, and heartaches better. ...\
6:57\
Thus, covenant keepers are entitled\
to a special kind of rest.”\
7:03\
This is the kind of rest and peace\
I saw in the eyes of the widow,\
7:08\
despite the heartache of missing\
her husband every day.\
7:13\
The New Testament tells of a time when\
Jesus and His disciples were on a ship:\
7:19\
“And there arose a great storm of wind,\
and the waves beat into the ship. ...\
7:24\
And he was ... asleep on a pillow:\
7:27\
and they awake him, and say unto him,\
Master, carest thou not that we perish?\
7:33\
And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and\
said unto the sea, Peace be still. ...\
7:39\
And he said unto them, why\
are ye so fearful?\
7:42\
how is it that ye have no faith?”\
7:46\
I have always been intrigued\
by this story.\
7:49\
Did the Lord expect them to use\
their faith to calm the storm,\
7:52\
to rebuke the winds? Faith\
in Jesus Christ is\
7:56\
the feeling of peace to\
withstand the storm,\
8:00\
knowing that we will not perish because\
He is in the ship with us.\
8:06\
This is the kind of faith we saw when\
we visit the families after\
8:12\
the fires in Chile. Their houses\
had been burned to the ground.\
8:16\
They had lost everything.\
8:18\
Yet as we were working in what\
used to be their homes,\
8:22\
and they were telling us about\
their experiences,\
8:25\
we felt that we were standing\
on holy ground.\
8:28\
One sister said to my wife, “When I saw\
that nearby houses were burning,\
8:34\
I had the impression that our house\
was going to be burned,\
8:38\
that we were going to lose everything.\
8:41\
Instead of desperation, I experienced\
a sense of indescribable peace.\
8:47\
Somehow I felt everything\
was going to be okay.”\
8:52\
Trusting God and keeping our covenants\
with Him brings power to our weakness\
8:57\
and comfort to our grief.\
9:00\
I am grateful for the opportunity\
that Renee and\
9:04\
I had to meet some of these\
extraordinary Saints;\
9:09\
for their many examples of faith,\
9:11\
strength, and perseverance; for\
stories of heartbreak\
9:15\
and disappointment that will never make\
the front page of a newspaper\
9:21\
or never go viral; for the pictures\
that are not taken\
9:26\
of tears shed and prayers offered after\
a loss or a traumatic divorce; for\
9:33\
the posts that are never\
made of the fear,\
9:35\
the sorrow, and pain that becomes\
bearable thanks to their faith in\
9:40\
Jesus Christ and His Atonement.\
9:43\
These people strengthened my own faith,\
and for that I'm deeply grateful.\
9:48\
I know this is the Church\
of Jesus Christ.\
9:50\
I know He stands ready to endow us with\
His power if we come to Him each\
9:57\
and every day. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
