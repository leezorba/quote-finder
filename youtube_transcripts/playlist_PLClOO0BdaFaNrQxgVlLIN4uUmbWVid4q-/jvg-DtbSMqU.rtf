One of the most touching moments\
in the Book of Mormon is\
0:04\
the resurrected Savior's visit to\
the people at the temple in\
0:07\
the land Bountiful. After a day of\
teaching, healing, and building faith,\
0:12\
Jesus directed the people’s attention\
to the rising generation:\
0:17\
“He commanded that their little\
children should be brought.”\
0:21\
He prayed for them and blessed\
them one by one.\
0:25\
The experience was so moving that the\
Savior Himself wept multiple times.\
0:31\
Then, speaking to the multitude, Jesus\
said, “Behold your little ones.\
0:36\
And as they looked ... they\
saw the heavens open,\
0:39\
and they saw angels descending out of\
heaven,” ministering to their children.\
0:46\
I have often thought about\
this experience.\
0:48\
It must have melted every person’s\
heart! They saw the Savior.\
0:54\
They felt Him. They knew Him.\
He taught them.\
0:59\
He blessed them, and He loved them.\
1:03\
It's no wonder that after\
this sacred event,\
1:06\
these children grew up to help\
establish a society of peace,\
1:10\
prosperity, and Christlike love\
that lasted for generations.\
1:15\
Wouldn't it be wonderful if our children\
could have experiences like\
1:19\
that with Jesus Christ—something that\
would bind their hearts to Him?\
1:23\
He invites us as He invited\
those parents in\
1:26\
the Book of Mormon to bring\
our little ones to Him.\
1:30\
We can help them know their Savior and\
Redeemer the way these children did.\
1:34\
We can show them how to find the\
Savior in the scriptures\
1:38\
and build their foundations on Him.\
1:42\
Recently, a good friend taught me\
something I hadn't noticed before about\
1:45\
the parable of the wise man who\
built his house upon a rock.\
1:49\
According to the account in Luke,\
1:51\
as the wise men laid the foundation\
for his house, “he digged deep.”\
1:56\
It wasn’t a casual or simple endeavor—\
1:59\
it took effort! To build our lives\
on the rock of our Redeemer,\
2:05\
Jesus Christ, we need to dig deep.\
2:08\
We remove anything that is sandy\
or superfluous in our lives.\
2:12\
We keep digging until we find Him.\
2:15\
And we teach our children to bind\
themselves to Him through sacred\
2:19\
ordinances and covenants, so that when\
the oppositional storms and floods come,\
2:24\
as they surely will, they will have\
little effect upon them “because of\
2:29\
the rock upon which [they] are built.”\
2:32\
This kind of strength\
doesn't just happen.\
2:34\
It's not passed on to the next\
generation like a spiritual inheritance.\
2:39\
Each person must dig deep\
to find the Rock.\
2:44\
We learn this lesson from another\
account in the Book of Mormon.\
2:47\
When King Benjamin gave his final\
address to his people,\
2:50\
they gathered as families\
to hear his words.\
2:53\
King Benjamin bore powerful\
witness of Jesus Christ,\
2:57\
and the people were deeply\
moved by his testimony. They\
3:00\
declared “The Spirit ... has wrought a\
mighty change in us, or in our hearts.\
3:06\
... And we are willing to enter into\
3:07\
a covenant with our God to do his will\
... all the remainder of our days.”\
3:13\
One might expect that little children\
with such deeply converted parents\
3:18\
would eventually become converted\
and make covenants themselves.\
3:22\
And yet, for some reason not\
mentioned in the record,\
3:26\
the covenant made by the parents did\
not get traction with some of their\
3:31\
children. Several years later,\
3:34\
“there were many of the rising\
generation that could not understand\
3:37\
the words of King Benjamin, being little\
children at the time he spake\
3:41\
unto his people; and\
they did not believe\
3:44\
the tradition of their fathers.\
3:46\
They did not believe what had been said\
concerning the resurrection of\
3:50\
the dead, neither did they believe\
concerning the coming of Christ. ...\
3:54\
And they would not be baptized;\
3:56\
neither would they join the church.\
And they were a separate people\
4:01\
as to their faith.” What a sobering\
thought! For the rising generation,\
4:08\
it is not enough for faith\
in Jesus Christ to be\
4:11\
“the tradition of their fathers.”\
4:14\
They need to own faith in\
Christ for themselves. As\
4:18\
the covenant people of God,\
4:20\
how can we instill within the hearts\
of our children a desire to make\
4:25\
and keep covenants with Him? We can\
start by following the example of Nephi:\
4:31\
“We talk of Christ,\
we rejoice in Christ,\
4:34\
we preach of Christ, we\
prophesy of Christ, and\
4:37\
we write according to our prophecies,\
that our children may know\
4:41\
to what source they may look\
for remission of their sins.”\
4:46\
Nephi’s words imply a constant, ongoing\
effort to teach our children about\
4:51\
Christ. We can ensure that the voice of\
4:54\
the covenant people is not silent in\
the ears of the rising generation,\
5:00\
and that Jesus is not\
a Sunday-only topic.\
5:05\
The voice of the covenant people is\
found in our own words of testimony.\
5:09\
It is found in the words\
of living prophets,\
5:12\
and it is preserved powerfully\
in the scriptures.\
5:15\
It is there that our children\
will come to know Jesus\
5:18\
and find answers to their questions.\
It is there\
5:22\
they will learn for themselves the\
doctrine of Christ. It is there\
5:28\
they will find hope. This will prepare\
them for a lifetime of seeking truth\
5:34\
and living on the covenant path.\
5:38\
I love this counsel from President\
Russell M. Nelson:\
5:41\
“Where can we go to hear Him?\
We can go to the scriptures.\
5:45\
They teach us about Jesus\
Christ and His gospel,\
5:49\
the magnitude of His Atonement, and our\
father’s great plan of happiness\
5:53\
and redemption. Daily immersion\
in the word of God is crucial\
5:58\
for spiritual survival, especially in\
these days of increasing upheaval.\
6:03\
As we feast on the words\
of Christ daily,\
6:06\
the words of Christ will tell us how\
to respond to difficulties we never\
6:11\
thought we would face.” So what\
does it look like to feast on\
6:16\
the words of Christ and hear Him?\
6:18\
Well, it looks like whatever\
works best for you.\
6:21\
It might be gathering with your family\
to talk about the things\
6:24\
the Holy Ghost taught you in your\
scripture study using “Come, Follow Me.”\
6:29\
It might be gathering each day with your\
children to read a few verses from\
6:33\
the scriptures, and then looking\
6:35\
for opportunities to discuss what you\
learned as you spend time together.\
6:40\
Just find what works for\
you and your family.\
6:43\
Then try to do a little better each day.\
6:48\
Consider this insight from “Teaching\
in the Savior’s Way”:\
6:52\
“Taken individually, a single home\
evening, scripture study\
6:56\
session, or gospel conversation may not\
seem like it’s accomplishing much,\
7:02\
but the accumulation of small,\
7:04\
simple efforts, repeated consistently\
over time, can be more powerful\
7:09\
and strengthening than an occasional\
monumental moment or landmark lesson.\
7:15\
... So don’t give up and don’t worry\
about accomplishing something grand\
7:20\
every time. Just be consistent\
in your efforts.”\
7:24\
One of our most sacred responsibilities\
is to help our children come to know\
7:29\
deeply and specifically that Jesus is\
the Christ, the Son of the living God,\
7:36\
their personal Savior and Redeemer, who\
stands at the head of His Church.\
7:42\
We cannot allow our covenant\
voice to become muted\
7:46\
or silent when it comes to Him.\
7:50\
You may feel a bit inadequate in this\
role, but you should never feel alone.\
7:56\
For example, ward councils are\
authorized to organize teacher council\
8:01\
meetings for parents. In these\
quarterly meetings,\
8:04\
parents can gather to learn from\
each other’s experiences,\
8:08\
discuss how they are strengthening\
their families,\
8:11\
and learn key principles\
of Christlike teaching.\
8:14\
This meeting should be held in\
the second hour of church.\
8:17\
It is led by a ward member selected\
by the bishop and follows\
8:21\
the format of regular teacher council\
meetings using “Teaching in\
8:26\
the Savior’s Way” as the primary\
resource. Bishops,\
8:31\
if your ward is not currently holding\
teacher council meetings for parents,\
8:35\
work with your Sunday School president\
and ward council to organize yourselves.\
8:43\
My dear friends in Christ, you are\
doing much better than you think.\
8:48\
Just keep working at it. Your children\
are watching, listening, and learning.\
8:54\
As you teach them, you will come to know\
their true nature as beloved sons\
8:59\
and daughters of God. They may forget\
the Savior for a season,\
9:03\
but I promise you, He will\
never forget them.\
9:08\
Those moments when the Holy Ghost speaks\
to them will persist in their\
9:12\
hearts and minds. And one day\
your children will echo\
9:16\
the testimony of Enos: “I know my\
parents are just—’for [they] taught me\
9:21\
in the nurture and admonition of the\
Lord—and blessed be the name of my God\
9:26\
for it.’” Let us accept the\
Savior’s invitation\
9:30\
and bring our children to Him. As\
we do so, they will see Him.\
9:37\
They will feel Him. They will know Him.\
He will teach them.\
9:43\
He will bless them. And oh, how He will\
love them. And oh, how I love Him.\
9:52\
In His holy name, Jesus Christ, amen.\
