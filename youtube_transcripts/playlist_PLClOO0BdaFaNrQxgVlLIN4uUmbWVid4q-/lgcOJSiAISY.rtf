When our youngest daughter Berkley, was\
little, I started using reading glasses,\
0:05\
the kind that zoom in and\
magnify everything.\
0:08\
One day, as we sat together reading\
a book, I looked at her with love\
0:11\
but also sadness, because suddenly\
she seemed so grown up.\
0:15\
I thought, “Where has the time gone?\
She’s so big.”\
0:18\
As I lifted my reading glasses to wipe\
away a tear, I realized, “Oh wait,\
0:22\
she’s not bigger. It’s just\
these glasses. Never mind.”\
0:26\
Sometimes all we can see is that up\
close, magnified view of those we love.\
0:31\
Tonight, I invite you to zoom out and\
look through a different lens,\
0:35\
an eternal lens that focuses on the\
big picture, your bigger story.\
0:40\
During humankind's early\
push into space,\
0:43\
the unmanned rockets had no windows.\
0:45\
But by the Apollo 8 mission to\
the moon, the astronauts had one.\
0:48\
While floating in space, they were\
struck by the power of seeing our earth\
0:52\
and took this spectacular image\
capturing the whole world's attention.\
0:57\
Those astronauts experienced\
a sensation\
0:59\
so powerful it has been given its\
own name—the Overview Effect.\
1:04\
Viewing from a new vantage\
point changes everything.\
1:07\
One space traveler said\
it “reduces things to a size ...\
1:10\
you think is manageable. ... We can\
do this! Peace on earth—no problem.\
1:15\
It gives people that type of energy,\
... that type of power.”\
1:19\
As humans, we have an earthbound\
point of view,\
1:22\
but God sees the grand overview\
of the universe.\
1:25\
He sees all creation, all of us,\
and is filled with hope.\
1:29\
Is it possible to begin to see\
1:31\
as God sees while living on the\
surface of this planet—\
1:34\
to feel this overview feeling?\
1:37\
I believe we can, through the eye faith,\
1:39\
zoom out and view ourselves and our\
families with hope and joy.\
1:43\
And the scriptures agree.\
1:45\
Moroni speaks about those whose\
faith was “exceedingly strong”\
1:49\
and that they “truly saw ...\
with an eye faith,\
1:51\
and they were glad.” With an eye\
focused on the Savior,\
1:55\
they felt joy and knew this truth:\
Because of Christ, it all works out.\
2:01\
Everything you and you and\
you are worried about—\
2:05\
it’s all going to be okay!\
2:08\
And those who look with an eye of faith\
can feel that it’s going to be okay now.\
2:12\
I went through a rough patch my\
senior year in high school when\
2:16\
I wasn't making great choices.\
2:18\
I remember seeing my mom crying and\
wondering if I disappointed her.\
2:22\
At the time, I worried that her tears\
meant she’d lost hope for me,\
2:25\
and if she didn't feel hope for me,\
maybe there wasn't a way back.\
2:29\
But my dad was more practiced at zooming\
out and taking the long view.\
2:33\
He had learned from experience that\
worry feels a lot like love,\
2:36\
but it's not the same. He used\
2:39\
the eye of faith to see everything\
would work out,\
2:41\
and his hopeful approach changed me.\
2:44\
When I graduated from high\
school and went to BYU,\
2:47\
my dad sent letters reminding me of who\
I was. He became my cheerleader.\
2:52\
And everybody needs a cheerleader—\
2:54\
someone who isn’t telling you you’re\
not running fast enough,\
2:57\
they’re lovingly reminding you that you\
can. Dad exemplified Lehi’s dream.\
3:02\
Like Lehi, he knew that you don’t\
chase after your loved ones who feel\
3:06\
lost; you stay where you\
are and you call them.\
3:10\
You go to the tree, you\
stay at the tree,\
3:12\
keep eating the fruit, and, with\
a smile on your face,\
3:15\
continue to beckon to those you love\
and show by example that eating\
3:20\
the fruit is a happy thing.\
3:22\
This visual image has helped me during\
low moments when I find myself at\
3:26\
the tree eating the fruit and\
crying because I'm worried.\
3:29\
And really, how helpful is that?\
Instead, let’s choose hope—\
3:34\
hope in our Creator and in one another,\
3:37\
fueling our ability to be better\
than we are right now.\
3:41\
Shortly after Elder Neal A.\
Maxwell passed away,\
3:44\
a reporter asked his son\
what he'd miss most.\
3:46\
He said dinners at his parents’ house\
3:48\
because he always left feeling\
like his dad believed in him.\
3:52\
This was around the same time our adult\
children were starting to come home\
3:55\
for Sunday dinners with their spouses.\
3:58\
During the week, I found myself making\
lists in my mind of things that I could\
4:01\
remind them of on Sunday,\
4:03\
like, “Maybe try and help out more\
with the kids when you’re home,”\
4:06\
or “Don’t forget to be a good listener.”\
4:09\
When I read Brother Maxwell's comment,\
4:11\
I threw away the list and silenced\
that critical voice.\
4:15\
So when I saw my grown children\
for that brief time each week,\
4:18\
I focused on the many positive things\
they were already doing.\
4:22\
And when our oldest son Ryan passed\
away a few years later,\
4:26\
I remember being grateful our time\
together was happier and more positive.\
4:31\
Before we interact with a loved one,\
can we ask ourselves this question\
4:35\
“Is what I’m about to do or\
say helpful or hurtful?”\
4:39\
Because our words are one\
of our superpowers,\
4:42\
and family members are like human\
blackboards standing in front of us\
4:45\
saying, “Write what you think of me.”\
4:48\
These messages, whether intentional\
or unintentional,\
4:50\
should be hopeful and encouraging.\
4:53\
Our job is not to teach someone\
who's going through\
4:56\
a rough patch that they are\
bad or disappointing.\
4:59\
On rare occasions we may feel\
prompted to correct,\
5:02\
but most often let's tell our loved\
ones in spoken and unspoken ways\
5:07\
the messages they long to hear:\
5:10\
“Our family feels whole and complete\
because you are in it.”\
5:13\
“You will be loved for the rest\
of your life no matter what.”\
5:18\
Sometimes what we need is empathy\
more than advice,\
5:21\
listening more than a lecture;\
5:23\
someone who hears and wonders,\
“How would\
5:26\
I have to feel to say\
what they just said?”\
5:29\
Remember, families are a God-given\
laboratory where we’re figuring things\
5:33\
out. So missteps and miscalculations are\
not just possible, but probable.\
5:38\
And wouldn't it be interesting if at\
5:40\
the end of our lives we could see\
that those relationships,\
5:43\
even those challenging moments,\
5:44\
were the very things that helped us\
to become more like our Savior.\
5:49\
Each difficult interaction is an\
opportunity to learn how to love at\
5:53\
a deeper level—a Godlike level.\
5:55\
Let's zoom out to view family\
relationships as\
5:58\
the powerful vehicle to teach us the\
lessons we came here to learn\
6:02\
as we turn to the Savior.\
6:04\
Let's admit, in a fallen world, there's\
no way to be a perfect spouse, parent,\
6:09\
son, daughter, grandchild,\
mentor, or friend—\
6:12\
but a million ways to be a good one.\
6:14\
Let’s stay at the tree, partake of the\
love of God, and share it. By lifting\
6:19\
the people around us,\
we ascend together.\
6:23\
Unfortunately, the memory of eating\
the fruit is not enough.\
6:26\
We need to partake again and again\
in ways that reposition our lens\
6:30\
and connect us to the heavenly\
overview by opening up\
6:33\
the scriptures which are filled with\
light to chase away the darkness,\
6:37\
staying on our knees until our\
casual prayer turns mighty.\
6:41\
This is when hearts soften\
and we begin to see,\
6:44\
as God sees. In these last days,\
6:47\
perhaps our greatest work will\
be with our loved ones—\
6:49\
good people living in a wicked world.\
6:52\
Our hope changes the way they see\
themselves and who they really are.\
6:56\
And through this lens of love, they'll\
see who they will become.\
7:00\
But the adversary does not want us\
7:02\
or our loved ones to return\
home together.\
7:04\
And because we live on a planet\
that is bound by time and\
7:07\
a finite number of years,\
7:09\
he tries to perpetuate a very\
real sense of panic in us.\
7:13\
It's hard to see when you're zoomed in\
that our direction matters more than\
7:17\
our speed. Remember, “If you\
want to go fast, go alone;\
7:21\
if you want to go far, go together.”\
7:24\
Thankfully, the God we worship\
is not bound by time.\
7:27\
He sees who our loved ones really\
are and who we really are.\
7:30\
So He’s patient with us, hoping we’ll\
be patient with each other.\
7:34\
I will admit there are times when Earth,\
our temporal home, feels like\
7:38\
an island of sorrow—moments when\
I have one eye of faith and\
7:42\
the other is weeping. Do you know\
this feeling? I had it Tuesday.\
7:48\
Can we instead choose the faithful\
posture of our prophet when he promises\
7:52\
miracles in our families?\
7:54\
If we do, our joy will increase,\
even if turbulence increases.\
7:58\
He is promising that an overview\
effect can be experienced now,\
8:03\
regardless of our circumstances.\
8:05\
Having this eye of faith now is\
a recapturing or an echo of\
8:09\
the faith we had before we\
came to this planet.\
8:11\
It sees past the uncertainty\
of a moment,\
8:14\
allowing us to “cheerfully do all\
things that lie in our power; and then\
8:18\
... stand still.” Is there something\
difficult in your life right\
8:23\
now? Something you’re worried\
can’t be resolved? Without\
8:26\
the eye of faith, that might feel like\
God has lost oversight of things,\
8:30\
and is that true? Or maybe your greater\
fear is that you’re going to go through\
8:34\
this difficult time all by yourself.\
8:36\
But that would mean that God has\
abandoned you, and is that true?\
8:40\
It is my witness that the Savior has the\
ability, because of His Atonement,\
8:45\
to turn any nightmare you are going\
through into a blessing.\
8:48\
He has given us a promise “with\
an immutable covenant”\
8:51\
that as we strive to love\
and follow Him,\
8:54\
“all things wherewith [we] have been\
afflicted shall work together\
8:57\
for [our] good.” All things.\
8:59\
And because we are children\
of the covenant,\
9:02\
we can ask for this hopeful feeling now!\
9:05\
While our families aren't perfect,\
9:07\
we can perfect our love for others until\
it becomes a constant, unchanging,\
9:11\
no-matter-what kind of love—\
9:13\
the type of love that supports change\
and allows for growth and return.\
9:17\
It is the Savior's work to bring\
our loved ones back.\
9:20\
It is His work and His timing.\
9:23\
It is our work to provide the hope and\
a heart they can come home to.\
9:27\
“We have neither [God’s] authority to\
condemn nor His power to redeem,\
9:31\
but we have been authorized\
to exercise His love.”\
9:35\
President Nelson has also taught that\
others need our love more than our\
9:38\
judgment. “They need to experience\
9:40\
the pure love of Jesus Christ reflected\
in [our] words and actions.”\
9:44\
Love is the thing that changes hearts.\
9:47\
It is the purest motive of all,\
and others can feel it.\
9:50\
Let’s hold fast to these prophetic\
words offered 50 years ago:\
9:54\
“No home is a failure unless\
it quits trying.”\
9:58\
Surely those who love the most and\
10:00\
the longest win! In earthly families\
we’re simply doing what God has done\
10:05\
with us—pointing the way\
10:07\
and hoping our loved ones will\
go in that direction,\
10:09\
knowing the path they travel\
is theirs to choose.\
10:12\
And when they pass to the\
other side of the veil\
10:15\
and draw close to that loving\
gravitational pull of their heavenly\
10:18\
home, I believe it will feel familiar\
because of how they were loved here.\
10:23\
Let's use that overview lens and see\
the people we love and live with\
10:27\
as shared companions on this beautiful\
planet. You and I? We can do this!\
10:32\
We can hold on and hope on!\
10:35\
We can stay at the tree, partake of the\
fruit with a smile on our face,\
10:39\
letting the light of Christ in our eyes\
become something others can count\
10:43\
on in their darkest hours.\
10:44\
And as they see light manifest\
in our countenances,\
10:47\
they will be drawn to it.\
10:49\
We can then help refocus\
their attention to\
10:51\
the original source of love and light,\
10:53\
the Bright and Morning\
Star, Jesus Christ.\
10:56\
I bear my testimony that this—all\
of this—is going to turn out\
11:01\
so much better than we could ever\
imagine. With an eye of faith\
11:04\
on Jesus Christ, may we see that\
everything will be all right in\
11:08\
the end and feel that it will be all\
right now. In the name of Jesus Christ,\
11:12\
amen.\
