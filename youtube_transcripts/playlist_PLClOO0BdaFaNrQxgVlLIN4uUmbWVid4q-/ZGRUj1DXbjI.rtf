It has been prophesied since at\
least the days of Isaiah\
0:05\
that in the latter days the Lord’s\
ancient covenant people,\
0:09\
the House of Israel, should be gathered\
in from their long dispersion from\
0:13\
the isles of the sea and from\
the four parts of the earth,\
0:17\
and restored to the lands\
of their inheritance.\
0:20\
President Russell M. Nelson\
has spoken often\
0:23\
and powerfully about this gathering,\
0:25\
calling it the most important thing\
taking place on Earth today.\
0:30\
What is the purpose of this gathering?\
0:36\
By revelation to the prophet\
Joseph Smith,\
0:38\
the Lord had identified one purpose\
as the protection of\
0:43\
the covenant people. He said,\
0:46\
The gathering together upon the land of\
Zion and upon her stakes will be for\
0:51\
a defense and for a refuge\
from the storm\
0:53\
and from wrath when it shall be poured\
out without mixture upon\
0:58\
the whole earth. Wrath in this\
context may be understood as\
1:04\
the natural consequences of widespread\
disobedience to the laws\
1:09\
and commandments of God.\
Most importantly,\
1:13\
the gathering is for the purpose of\
bringing the blessings of salvation\
1:17\
and exaltation to all who\
will receive them.\
1:22\
It is how the covenant promises given\
to Adam or Abraham are realized.\
1:27\
The Lord told Abraham that through\
his seed and priesthood,\
1:32\
all the families of the earth\
should be blessed,\
1:35\
even with the blessings of the gospel,\
which are the blessings of salvation,\
1:39\
even of life eternal. President\
Nelson expressed it this way:\
1:45\
When we embrace the gospel\
and are baptized,\
1:48\
we take upon ourselves the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ.\
1:52\
Baptism is the gate that leads to\
becoming joint heirs to all\
1:57\
the promises given anciently by\
the Lord to Abraham, Isaac,\
2:02\
Jacob, and their posterity.\
2:05\
In 1836, Moses appeared to the\
Prophet Joseph Smith in\
2:09\
the Kirtland Temple and\
committed the keys of\
2:12\
the gathering of Israel from the\
four parts of the earth.\
2:16\
On that same occasion, Elias appeared\
and committed the dispensation of\
2:20\
the gospel of Abraham,\
saying that in us\
2:24\
and our seed all generations\
after us should be blessed.\
2:28\
With this authority, we now carry\
the gospel of Jesus Christ,\
2:34\
the good news of redemption\
through Him, to all parts\
2:39\
and peoples of the earth, and gather all\
who will into the gospel covenant.\
2:45\
They become the seed of Abraham\
and the church and kingdom and\
2:48\
the elect of God. On that same occasion\
in the Kirtland Temple,\
2:54\
there was a third heavenly messenger\
who appeared to Joseph Smith\
2:58\
and Oliver Cowdery. I speak of\
the Prophet Elijah and it is\
3:03\
the authority and keys he restored\
that I want to speak about today.\
3:08\
The power to validate all priesthood\
ordinances and make them binding both\
3:14\
on earth and in heaven. The sealing\
power is crucial for gathering\
3:18\
and preparing a covenant people\
on both sides of the veil.\
3:23\
Years earlier, Moroni had made it clear\
to Joseph Smith that Elijah would\
3:28\
bring essential priesthood authority.\
3:30\
I will reveal unto you the priesthood\
by the hand of Elijah the Prophet.\
3:36\
Joseph Smith later explained,\
Why send Elijah?\
3:40\
Because he holds the keys of the\
authority to administer in all\
3:45\
the ordinances of the priesthood, and\
unless the authority is given,\
3:49\
the ordinances could not be administered\
in righteousness.\
3:53\
That is, the ordinances would not be\
valid in both time and eternity.\
4:00\
In a teaching now canonized as\
scripture in the Doctrine\
4:03\
and Covenants, the Prophet stated,\
4:06\
It may seem to some to be a very\
bold doctrine that we talk of,\
4:10\
a power which records or binds\
on earth and binds in heaven.\
4:14\
Nevertheless, in all ages of the world,\
4:17\
whenever the Lord has given\
a dispensation of\
4:19\
the priesthood to any man by actual\
revelation or any set of men,\
4:24\
this power has always been given.\
4:27\
Hence, whatsoever those men did in\
authority in the name of the Lord\
4:31\
and did it truly and faithfully\
and kept the proper\
4:35\
and faithful record of the same.\
4:37\
It became a law on earth and in heaven\
4:40\
and could not be annulled according to\
the decrees of the great Jehovah.\
4:46\
We tend to think of the\
sealing authority\
4:48\
as applying only to certain\
temple ordinances,\
4:52\
but that authority is necessary\
to make any ordinance valid\
4:56\
and binding beyond death.\
4:58\
The sealing power confers a seal of\
legitimacy upon your baptism,\
5:04\
for example, so that it is recognized\
here and in heaven.\
5:09\
Ultimately, all priesthood ordinances\
are performed under the keys of\
5:13\
the President of the Church.\
5:16\
And as President Joseph Fielding\
Smith explained, He,\
5:20\
the President of the Church\
has given us authority.\
5:23\
He has put the sealing power in our\
priesthood because he holds those keys.\
5:30\
There's another vital purpose in\
5:32\
the gathering of Israel that has special\
meaning when we talk about\
5:35\
sealing on earth and in heaven. That's\
the building and operation of temples.\
5:41\
As the Prophet Joseph Smith explained,\
5:44\
What was the object of gathering\
the people of God in any age of\
5:48\
the world? The main object\
was to build unto the Lord\
5:52\
a house whereby he could reveal unto His\
people the ordinances of His house\
5:57\
and the glories of His kingdom\
and teach the people\
6:01\
the way of salvation. For there are\
certain ordinances and principles that,\
6:06\
when they're taught and practiced,\
6:08\
must be done in a place or house\
built for that purpose.\
6:14\
The validity that the sealing power\
gives to priesthood ordinances includes,\
6:18\
of course, vicarious ordinances\
performed in the place designated by\
6:22\
the Lord: His temple. Here we see\
the majesty and sacredness of\
6:27\
the sealing power. It makes\
individual salvation\
6:31\
and family exaltation universally\
available to\
6:35\
the children of God wherever and\
whenever they may have lived\
6:38\
on the earth. No other theology\
or philosophy\
6:42\
or authority can match such an\
all-inclusive opportunity.\
6:48\
The sealing power is a perfect\
manifestation of the justice,\
6:52\
mercy, and love of God. With access\
to the sealing power,\
6:58\
our hearts naturally turn to\
those who've gone before.\
7:02\
The latter-day gathering into the\
covenant crosses through the veil.\
7:06\
In the perfect order of God,\
7:08\
the living cannot experience eternal\
life in its fullness without forging\
7:13\
enduring links to the fathers,\
our ancestors.\
7:16\
Likewise, the progress of those who\
are already on the other side,\
7:21\
or who may yet cross through\
the veil of death without\
7:24\
the benefit of sealings, is incomplete\
until vicarious ordinances bind them\
7:29\
to us, their descendants, and us\
to them in the divine order.\
7:35\
The commitment to aid one another across\
the veil can be classified as\
7:39\
a covenant promise. Part of the\
new and everlasting covenant.\
7:44\
In Joseph Smith's words, we want to seal\
up our dead to come forth with us\
7:50\
in the First Resurrection.\
7:54\
The highest and holiest manifestation\
of the sealing power is in\
7:57\
the eternal union of a man and\
a woman in marriage and\
8:01\
the linking of humankind through\
all their generations.\
8:06\
Because the authority to officiate\
in these ordinances is so sacred,\
8:11\
the President of the Church personally\
oversees its delegation to others.\
8:17\
President Gordon Hinckley\
said on one occasion,\
8:21\
I've said many times that if nothing\
else came out of all the sorrow\
8:25\
and travail and pain of\
the Restoration than\
8:28\
the sealing power of the holy priesthood\
to bind together families\
8:32\
forever, it would have been worth\
all that it has cost.\
8:38\
Without the sealings that\
create eternal families\
8:40\
and link generations here\
8:42\
and hereafter, we would be left in\
eternity with neither roots\
8:47\
nor branches. That is, neither\
ancestry nor posterity.\
8:53\
It is this free-floating, disconnected\
state of individuals on the one hand,\
8:58\
or connections that defy the marriage\
and family relations God has ordained on\
9:03\
the other hand, that would frustrate the\
very purpose of the earth’s creation.\
9:08\
Were that to become the norm,\
9:10\
it would be tantamount to the earth\
being smitten with a curse\
9:14\
or utterly wasted at the Lord's coming.\
9:18\
We can see why marriage between a man\
and a woman is ordained of God\
9:22\
and that the family is central\
to the Creator’s plan for\
9:25\
the eternal destiny of His children.\
9:28\
At the same time, we recognize that\
in the imperfect present,\
9:33\
this is not the reality or even a\
realistic possibility for some.\
9:38\
But we have hope in Christ. While\
we wait upon the Lord,\
9:42\
President M. Russell Ballard reminds\
us that, Scriptures\
9:46\
and Latter-day prophets confirm that\
everyone who is faithful in keeping\
9:50\
gospel covenants will have the\
opportunity for exaltation.\
9:56\
Some have experienced unhappy and\
unhealthy family circumstances\
10:01\
and feel little desire for an\
eternal family association.\
10:05\
Elder David A. Bednar made this\
observation: To you\
10:10\
who have experienced the heartache of\
a divorce in your family or felt\
10:14\
the agony of violated trust,\
10:17\
please remember that God’s pattern for\
families begins again with you.\
10:22\
One link in the chain of your\
generations may have been broken,\
10:26\
but the other righteous links\
and what remains of\
10:28\
the chain are nonetheless\
eternally important.\
10:32\
You can add strength to your chain\
and perhaps even help restore\
10:38\
the broken links. That work will\
be accomplished one by one.\
10:45\
In the funeral services for\
Sister Pat Holland,\
10:48\
wife of Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,\
10:50\
last July, President Russell M.\
Nelson taught, In time,\
10:56\
Patricia and Jeffrey will be reunited.\
10:58\
They will later be joined by their\
children and their covenant-keeping\
11:01\
posterity to experience\
11:04\
the fullness of joy that God has in\
store for His faithful children.\
11:09\
Knowing that, we understand that\
11:11\
the most important date in Patricia's\
life was not her birth date\
11:15\
or her death date. Her most important\
date was June 7th, 1963,\
11:22\
when she and Jeff were sealed\
in the Saint George temple.\
11:26\
Why so important? Because the very\
reason the earth was created was\
11:30\
so families could be formed\
and sealed to each other.\
11:34\
Salvation is an individual matter, but\
exaltation is a family matter.\
11:39\
No one can be exalted alone. End quote.\
11:44\
Not long ago, my wife and I joined a\
dear friend in a sealing room of\
11:48\
the Bountiful Utah temple.\
11:50\
I first met this friend when she was\
a child in Cordoba, Argentina.\
11:55\
My missionary companion and I\
were contacting people in\
11:59\
a neighborhood just blocks away\
from the mission office,\
12:02\
and she answered the door when\
we came to her home.\
12:05\
In due time, she and her mother\
and siblings joined the church\
12:09\
and they've remained faithful members.\
She's now a lovely woman.\
12:13\
And this day we were in the temple to\
seal her deceased parents to one\
12:17\
another and then seal her to them.\
12:22\
A couple who over the years\
have become close friends\
12:24\
represented her parents at the altar.\
12:27\
It was an emotional moment that became\
even sweeter when our Argentine friend\
12:32\
was sealed to her parents.\
12:35\
There were just six of us present on a\
quiet afternoon away from the world.\
12:40\
And yet one of the most important\
things that ever takes place on\
12:44\
the earth was happening. I was\
gratified that my role\
12:49\
and association had come full circle\
from knocking on her door as\
12:53\
a young missionary to now,\
12:55\
these many years later performing\
12:57\
the sealing ordinances that linked her\
to her parents and past generations.\
13:04\
This is a scene taking place constantly\
all over the world in temples.\
13:10\
This is the ultimate step in gathering\
the covenant people.\
13:14\
It is the highest privilege\
of your membership in\
13:17\
the Church of Jesus Christ.\
13:20\
I promise that as you faithfully seek\
that privilege in time or eternity,\
13:25\
it will surely be yours. I testify\
that the sealing power\
13:31\
and authority restored to Earth through\
the Prophet Joseph Smith are real.\
13:37\
That what is thereby bound and on\
Earth truly is bound in heaven.\
13:43\
I testify that President Russell M.\
Nelson, as President of the Church,\
13:48\
is the one man on Earth today\
that by his keys,\
13:51\
directs the use of this supernal power.\
13:55\
I testify that the atonement of Jesus\
Christ has made immortality a verity\
14:01\
and the possibility of exalted family\
relationships a reality.\
14:06\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
