My beloved brothers and sisters,\
0:05\
In this conference, we have\
been blessed with\
0:10\
an outpouring of revelation. Servants of\
the Lord Jesus Christ have spoken\
0:21\
and will speak words of truth,\
encouragement, and direction.\
0:32\
I have been touched by the testimonies\
borne in this conference that\
0:38\
the Lord speaks to us personally\
through the Holy Ghost.\
0:46\
As we pray and then heed the\
Spirit’s promptings,\
0:53\
we gain greater insights and\
blessings to guide us through\
1:00\
the increasingly difficult days ahead.\
1:05\
We have heard again\
President Russell M. Nelson’s\
1:10\
warning that “in coming days\
1:16\
it will not be possible\
to survive spiritually\
1:22\
without the guiding, directing,\
1:26\
comforting, and constant influence\
of the Holy Ghost.”\
1:36\
That prophetic warning\
has led me to ponder\
1:43\
what I might teach my children,\
grandchildren,\
1:49\
and great grandchildren about how\
to have that crucial guidance in\
1:58\
the difficult days ahead for them.\
2:02\
So this message today is a brief letter\
to my descendants that might help\
2:12\
them when I am not with them\
in the exciting days ahead.\
2:20\
I want them to know what I have come\
to know that could help them.\
2:29\
I have come to better understand what\
it will take for them to have\
2:36\
the constant influence\
of the Holy Ghost in\
2:42\
the days in which they will live.\
2:47\
And I have felt impressed to speak today\
of my personal experience of\
2:53\
inviting the Holy Ghost,\
as nearly as I could,\
2:59\
to be my constant companion.\
3:04\
My prayer is that I may be\
able to encourage them.\
3:14\
I would start them to think about\
and pray about Helaman’s sons,\
3:22\
Nephi and Lehi, and the other servants\
of the Lord laboring with them.\
3:32\
They faced fierce opposition.\
3:36\
They were serving in a wicked place\
3:39\
and had to deal with terrible\
deceptions. I take courage\
3:47\
and you could from this one verse from\
the record of Helaman. Open quote.\
3:57\
“And in the seventy and ninth year,\
there began to be much strife.\
4:04\
But it came to pass that\
Nephi and Lehi,\
4:09\
and many of their brethren who knew\
concerning the true points of doctrine,\
4:18\
having many revelations daily,\
4:23\
therefore they did preach unto the\
people, insomuch that they did put\
4:30\
an end to their strife\
in that same year.”\
4:38\
This account encourages me, and\
it could encourage you.\
4:44\
Helaman’s sons were taught and guided\
by a series of experiences with\
4:52\
the Holy Ghost. This assures me that\
we can be taught and learn from\
5:02\
the Spirit, line upon line,\
receiving what we need.\
5:09\
And then when we are ready,\
we will receive more.\
5:16\
I have been encouraged in the same way\
5:19\
by the account of Nephi being asked\
to go back to Jerusalem\
5:25\
for the plates of Laban. You remember\
the choice he made?\
5:30\
He said, “I will go and do the things\
which the Lord hath commanded.”\
5:38\
Nephi’s experience with the Holy Ghost\
on that errand has given me courage\
5:45\
many times when I have embarked on tasks\
I knew were assignments from\
5:52\
the Lord, but which seemed far\
beyond my past experience\
6:01\
and beyond what I saw as my capacity.\
6:05\
You remember what Nephi said\
about his experience?\
6:10\
“And it was by night; and I caused that\
6:14\
[my brothers] should hide themselves\
without the walls.\
6:19\
And after they had hid themselves,\
6:22\
I, Nephi, crept into the city and went\
forth towards the house of Laban.”\
6:33\
He goes on to say, “And I\
was led by the Spirit,\
6:39\
not knowing beforehand the\
things which I should do.”\
6:47\
I have been encouraged by knowing that\
Nephi was guided by the Spirit,\
6:54\
minute by minute, through the\
night on the Lord’s errand.\
7:04\
We need, and you will need, the\
constant companionship of\
7:10\
the Holy Ghost. Now we desire it,\
7:16\
yet we know from experience that\
it is not easy to achieve.\
7:25\
We each think and say and do things\
in our daily lives that can offend\
7:34\
the Spirit. When that\
happens, as it will,\
7:40\
we may feel disapproval from the Lord\
7:45\
and we may be tempted to\
feel we are alone.\
7:51\
It is important to remember the sure\
promise we receive each week\
7:59\
as we repent and partake\
of the sacrament,\
8:05\
“that they may always have his\
Spirit to be with them.”\
8:14\
If you have felt the influence\
of the Holy Ghost today,\
8:19\
you may take it as a\
sweet evidence that\
8:23\
the Atonement is working in your life.\
As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has said,\
8:33\
“Whenever these moments of\
our extremity come,\
8:38\
we must not succumb to the fear\
that God has abandoned us\
8:44\
or that He does not hear our prayers.\
He does hear us. He does see us.\
8:55\
He does love us.”\
8:59\
That assurance has helped me when\
I feel distant from the Lord,\
9:06\
when answers to my prayers\
seemed delayed.\
9:11\
I have learned to follow the counsel of\
President Nelson to review my life\
9:19\
for opportunities to repent.\
He reminds us,\
9:26\
“Daily repentance is the pathway to\
purity, and purity brings power.”\
9:36\
If you find yourself having difficulty\
in feeling the Holy Ghost,\
9:43\
you might ponder whether there is\
anything for which you might repent\
9:49\
and receive forgiveness. You can pray\
with faith to know what to do\
9:58\
to be cleansed and thus\
more nearly qualify\
10:04\
for that constant companionship of the\
Holy Ghost. If you want to receive\
10:13\
the companionship of the Holy Ghost, you\
must want it for the right reasons.\
10:21\
Your purposes must be\
the Lord's purposes.\
10:26\
If your motives are too selfish,\
10:29\
you will find it difficult to receive\
and sense the promptings of the Spirit.\
10:39\
The key for me and for you is to\
want what the Savior wants.\
10:45\
Our motives need to be driven\
by the pure love of Christ.\
10:50\
Our prayers need to be “All I want is\
what you want. Thy will be done.”\
11:02\
I try to remember the Savior’s sacrifice\
and His love for me.\
11:08\
Then when I pray to Heavenly\
Father to give thanks,\
11:13\
I feel love and assurance that\
my prayers are heard\
11:20\
and that I will receive whatever is\
best for me and those I love.\
11:27\
That strengthens my testimony.\
11:33\
Of all things to which the\
Holy Ghost testifies,\
11:37\
the most precious for us is\
that Jesus is the Christ,\
11:46\
the living Son of God.\
The Savior promised,\
11:52\
“When the Comforter is come, whom I will\
send unto you from the Father,\
11:59\
even the spirit of truth, which\
proceedeth from the Father.”\
12:05\
Years ago, I received a phone call\
from a distraught mother.\
12:12\
She told me that her daughter\
had moved far from home.\
12:18\
She sensed from the little contact she\
had with her daughter that something\
12:25\
was terribly wrong. She pleaded\
with me to help.\
12:32\
I found out who the daughter’s home\
teacher was. You can tell by that name\
12:38\
it was a long time ago. I called him.\
He was young. Yet\
12:46\
he told me that he and his companion\
both had been awakened in the night\
12:55\
with not only concern for that daughter,\
12:58\
but with inspiration that she was about\
to make choices that would bring\
13:04\
sadness and misery. With only that\
inspiration of the Spirit,\
13:12\
they went to see her. At first\
she did not want to tell\
13:18\
them about her situation.\
13:23\
Under inspiration, they pleaded with\
her to repent and choose the path\
13:30\
the Lord had for her. She realized then,\
13:38\
I believe by the Spirit, that\
13:41\
the only way they could have known\
what they knew about her\
13:48\
life was from God.\
13:51\
A mother turned her loving concerns over\
to Heavenly Father and the Savior.\
13:59\
The Holy Ghost had been sent\
to those home teachers\
14:03\
because they were willing\
to serve the Lord.\
14:07\
They had followed the counsel and\
promise found in the Doctrine\
14:13\
and Covenants. Open quote.\
14:16\
“Let thy bowels also be full of\
charity towards all men, and to\
14:22\
the household of faith, and let virtue\
garnish thy thoughts unceasingly;\
14:29\
then shall thy confidence wax\
strong in the presence of God;\
14:37\
and the doctrine of the priesthood\
shall distill upon thy soul as\
14:43\
the dews from heaven. The Holy Ghost\
shall be thy constant companion\
14:52\
and thy scepter an unchanging scepter\
of righteousness and truth;\
14:59\
and thy dominion shall be an\
everlasting dominion;\
15:04\
and without compulsory means, it shall\
flow unto thee forever and ever.”\
15:15\
I testify that the Lord\
has kept His promise.\
15:20\
The Holy Ghost is being sent to the\
faithful covenant members of\
15:25\
the Church of Jesus Christ.\
15:29\
Now, your experiences will be unique\
and the Spirit will guide in\
15:35\
the way best suited to your faith and\
capacity to receive revelation\
15:44\
for you and for those\
you love and serve.\
15:49\
I pray with all my heart that\
your confidence will grow.\
15:55\
I bear my witness that God the\
Father lives. He loves you.\
16:02\
He hears your every prayer.\
16:06\
Jesus Christ did pray to the Father to\
send the Holy Ghost to guide, comfort,\
16:16\
and testify of truth to us. The\
Father and His Beloved Son\
16:23\
appeared to Joseph Smith in a grove\
of trees. The Prophet Joseph\
16:32\
translated the Book of Mormon by\
the gift and power of God.\
16:40\
Heavenly messengers restored\
priesthood keys.\
16:45\
President Russell M. Nelson is the\
prophet of God for all the Earth.\
16:53\
As a witness of Jesus Christ, I know\
that He lives and He leads His Church.\
17:04\
You and I have the opportunity to have\
17:08\
the Holy Ghost as our\
constant companion\
17:13\
and to have those truths confirmed as\
we remember and love the Savior,\
17:20\
repent, and ask for His love to be in\
our hearts. I pray that we may have\
17:29\
that blessing and the companionship\
of the Holy Spirit\
17:36\
this day and every day of\
our lives. I love you.\
17:43\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
