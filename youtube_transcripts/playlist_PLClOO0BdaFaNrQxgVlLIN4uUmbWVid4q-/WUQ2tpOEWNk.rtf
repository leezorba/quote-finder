Six years ago, our family was traveling\
at night just outside\
0:05\
the city of Oxford. As is often\
the case with young children,\
0:09\
we needed to stop, so we found\
a service station with\
0:13\
an array of shops and restaurants.\
0:15\
With precision, we filed out of the car,\
0:18\
visited the services, and filed\
back in, resuming our journey.\
0:23\
Fifteen minutes later, our eldest son\
asked a significant question: “Where is\
0:33\
Jasper?” Jasper sits on his own at\
the back of the car.\
0:37\
We assumed he had fallen asleep or\
was hiding or playing a trick\
0:41\
on us. As his brother inspected the\
back of the car more closely,\
0:45\
we discovered our five-year-old\
son was not there.\
0:51\
Our hearts filled with dread.\
0:53\
As we made our way back to\
the service station,\
0:55\
we pleaded with Heavenly Father that\
Jasper would be kept safe.\
0:59\
We called the police and informed\
them of the situation.\
1:03\
When we anxiously arrived, more\
than 40 minutes later,\
1:07\
we found two police vehicles in the\
car park, lights flashing. Inside\
1:13\
one of them was Jasper, playing\
with the buttons.\
1:20\
I will never forget the joy we felt\
in being reunited with him.\
1:27\
Many of the Savior's parabolic\
teachings focus on gathering,\
1:32\
restoring, or striving to find that\
which has been scattered or lost.\
1:37\
Among these are the parables\
of the lost sheep,\
1:41\
the lost coin, and the lost son.\
1:45\
As this incident with Jasper has played\
in my mind over the years,\
1:49\
I have reflected on the divine identity\
and importance of God's children,\
1:54\
the redemptive power of Jesus Christ,\
1:57\
and the perfect love of a Father\
in Heaven who knows you and me.\
2:03\
I hope to bear witness of these truths\
today. Firstly, Children of God.\
2:10\
Life is challenging. Many people\
feel overwhelmed, alone,\
2:14\
isolated, or exhausted. When\
things are difficult,\
2:18\
we may feel that we have wandered\
or fallen behind.\
2:22\
Knowing that we are all children of God\
2:25\
and members of His eternal family will\
restore a sense of belonging\
2:30\
and purpose. President Ballard shared:\
2:34\
“There is one important identity\
we all share now and forever. ...\
2:40\
That is that you are and have always\
been a son or daughter of God. ...\
2:46\
Understanding this truth—\
2:48\
really understanding it and embracing\
it—is life-changing.”\
2:54\
Do not misunderstand or devalue how\
important you are to your Father in\
2:59\
Heaven. You are not an accidental\
byproduct of nature, a cosmic orphan,\
3:07\
or the result of matter\
plus time plus chance.\
3:12\
Where there is design,\
there is a designer.\
3:16\
Your life has meaning and purpose.\
3:20\
The ongoing Restoration of the gospel\
of Jesus Christ brings light\
3:24\
and understanding regarding\
your divine identity.\
3:28\
You are a beloved child\
of Heavenly Father.\
3:32\
You are the subject matter of all\
these parables and teachings.\
3:36\
God loves you so much that He sent His\
Son to heal, rescue, and redeem you.\
3:43\
Jesus Christ recognized the divine\
nature and eternal worth of each person.\
3:48\
He explained how the two great\
commandments to love God\
3:51\
and love our neighbor are\
3:53\
the foundation of all of\
God's commandments.\
3:56\
One of our divine responsibilities\
is to care for those in need.\
4:01\
This is why, as disciples of Jesus\
Christ, we “bear one another’s burdens,\
4:07\
... mourn with those that mourn, ...\
and comfort\
4:10\
those that stand in need of comfort.”\
4:13\
Religion is not only about our\
relationship with God;\
4:18\
it is also about our relationship\
with each other.\
4:22\
Elder Holland explained that the English\
word “religion” comes from\
4:25\
the Latin “religare” meaning “to tie”\
or more literally, “to retie.”\
4:31\
Thus, “true religion is the tie that\
binds us to God and to each other.”\
4:39\
How we treat one another truly matters.\
4:42\
President Nelson teaches, “The Savior’s\
message is clear: His true disciples\
4:48\
build, lift, encourage,\
persuade, and inspire.”\
4:54\
This is even more important when our\
fellow travelers feel lost, alone,\
5:01\
forgotten, or removed. We do not have\
to look far to find people who are\
5:07\
struggling. We can start by helping\
someone in our own family,\
5:11\
congregation, or local community.\
5:15\
We can also seek to relieve\
the suffering of\
5:18\
the 700 million people living\
in extreme poverty,\
5:22\
or the 100 million people who are\
forcibly displaced due to persecution,\
5:28\
conflict, and identity-based violence.\
5:32\
Jesus Christ is the perfect example\
of caring for those in need—\
5:38\
the hungry, the stranger, the sick,\
the poor, the imprisoned.\
5:45\
His work is our work. Elder Gong teaches\
that “our journey to God is\
5:54\
often found together.” As such,\
5:57\
our ward should be a refuge\
for all of God's children.\
6:01\
Are we passively attending church\
6:03\
or actively creating communities\
whose purpose is to worship,\
6:07\
remember Christ, and minister\
to one another?\
6:11\
We can heed President Nelson's counsel\
to judge less, love more,\
6:19\
and extend the pure love of Jesus Christ\
through our words and actions.\
6:25\
Two. The redemptive power\
of Jesus Christ.\
6:28\
The Atonement of Jesus Christ is\
6:30\
the supreme expression of our Heavenly\
Father's love for His children.\
6:34\
The word “atonement” describes\
6:36\
the setting “at one” of those who have\
been estranged or separated.\
6:41\
Our Savior's mission\
was to provide both\
6:43\
a way to return to Heavenly Father\
and relief in the journey.\
6:48\
The Savior knows through His experience\
6:50\
how to support us through\
life's challenges.\
6:54\
Make no mistake, Christ is our Rescuer\
and the Healer of our souls.\
7:01\
As we exercise faith, He helps us\
press forward through hardships.\
7:06\
He continues to extend His loving\
and merciful invitation:\
7:10\
“Come unto me all ye that labor and are\
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\
7:17\
Take my yoke upon you and learn of me;\
... and ye shall find rest unto your\
7:25\
souls.” The metaphor of the yoke\
is powerful. As President\
7:28\
Howard W. Hunter explained, “The yoke\
was a device that allowed the ‘strength’\
7:33\
of a second animal to be linked and\
coupled with the effort of a\
7:38\
single animal, sharing and reducing the\
heavy labor of the task in hand.\
7:45\
A burden that was overwhelming\
or perhaps impossible\
7:50\
for one to bear could be equitably\
and comfortably borne by two\
7:56\
bound together with a common yoke.”\
8:00\
Present Nelson taught: “You come unto\
Christ to be yoked with Him\
8:05\
and with His power, so that you’re\
not pulling life’s load alone.\
8:10\
You’re pulling life’s load yoked with\
the Savior and Redeemer of the world.”\
8:16\
How do we yoke or bind ourselves\
to the Savior?\
8:20\
Elder Bednar explains: “Making\
8:22\
and keeping sacred covenants yokes us\
to and with the Lord Jesus Christ.\
8:28\
In essence, the Savior is beckoning\
us to rely upon\
8:34\
and pull together with Him. ... We are\
not and never need be alone.”\
8:43\
To any one burdened, lost, confused,\
you do not have to do this alone.\
8:51\
Through the Atonement of Christ\
and His ordinances,\
8:54\
you can be yoked or bound to Him.\
8:56\
He will lovingly provide the strength\
and healing you need to face\
9:01\
the journey ahead. He is the refuge\
from our storms still.\
9:08\
Third. Heavenly Father’s love.\
9:12\
For the record, Jasper is witty,\
affectionate,\
9:17\
intelligent, and rambunctious.\
But the key to the story is\
9:26\
he is mine.\
9:30\
He is my son. And I love him more\
than he will ever know.\
9:40\
If an imperfect, earthly father feels\
this way about his child,\
9:46\
can you imagine how a perfect,\
glorified, loving\
9:50\
Heavenly Father feels about you?\
9:55\
To my dear friends of the rising\
generation, Gen Z and Gen Alpha:\
10:00\
please know faith requires work.\
10:03\
We live in a time when, for many,\
only seeing is believing.\
10:08\
Faith can be challenging\
and requires choices.\
10:11\
But prayers are answered and\
answers can be felt.\
10:17\
Some of the most real things\
in life are not seen.\
10:22\
They are felt, known, and experienced.\
They, too, are real.\
10:30\
Jesus Christ wants you to know and have\
10:33\
a relationship with your\
Father in Heaven.\
10:35\
He taught: “What man among\
you, having a son,\
10:39\
and he shall be standing out,\
and shall say, Father,\
10:43\
open thy house that I may come in\
and sup with thee, will not say,\
10:49\
Come in, my son; for mine is thine,\
and thine is mine.”\
10:56\
Can you think of a more personal, loving\
image of God, the Eternal Father?\
11:02\
You are His child. If you\
are feeling lost,\
11:07\
if you have questions or lack wisdom,\
11:09\
if you are struggling with\
your circumstances,\
11:12\
or wrestling with spiritual dissonance,\
turn to Him.\
11:18\
Pray to Him for comfort, love, answers,\
and direction. Whatever the need\
11:25\
and wherever you are, pour out your\
heart to your Heavenly Father.\
11:31\
For some, you may want to follow\
President Nelson's invitation\
11:34\
and “ask if He is really there—\
11:38\
If He knows you. Ask Him how He feels\
about you and then listen.”\
11:46\
Dear brothers and sisters: Know\
your Father in Heaven.\
11:50\
He is perfect and loving. Know\
who Jesus Christ is.\
11:54\
He is our Savior and Redeemer.\
11:57\
Bind yourself and those you love\
to Him and know who you are.\
12:02\
Know your true divine identity. God's\
plan of happiness is all about you.\
12:08\
You are His precious child\
and of great worth.\
12:11\
He knows and loves you. Of these simple\
but foundational truths\
12:16\
I testify, in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
