In the fifth chapter of Alma, an\
introspective question is posed:\
0:08\
“Could ye say if you were called to die\
at this time within yourselves\
0:13\
that ye have been sufficiently humble?”\
0:18\
The question implies that humility\
is a mandatory requirement\
0:22\
for us to be ready to return\
to the presence of God.\
0:28\
We all like to think we’re\
sufficiently humble.\
0:32\
But some experiences in life make\
us realize that the natural,\
0:36\
prideful man often is very\
much alive within us.\
0:42\
Years ago, when our two daughters\
were still living at home,\
0:47\
I decided to show them and my wife\
0:50\
the business unit for which I was in\
charge in the company I worked for.\
0:57\
My real purpose, though, was to show\
them a place where, unlike our home,\
1:02\
everyone would do exactly what I asked\
them to do without questioning me.\
1:09\
As we arrived at the front gate,\
1:11\
which usually opens automatically\
when my car approached,\
1:15\
I was surprised that it\
didn't open this time.\
1:19\
Instead, a security guard I had never\
seen before in my life came to the car\
1:25\
and asked me for my company ID.\
1:28\
I told him I never needed an ID to drive\
into the property with my car\
1:34\
and then asked him the classic prideful\
person question: “Do you know who you’re\
1:39\
talking to?”\
1:42\
To which he replied, “Well, since\
you don’t have your company ID,\
1:47\
I cannot know who you are.\
1:49\
And while I'm at this gate,\
1:52\
you will not be allowed to enter\
the premises without\
1:55\
a proper identification.” I\
thought about looking at\
1:59\
the rearview mirror to check my\
daughters’ reaction to all that,\
2:05\
but I knew they were savoring\
every second of that moment.\
2:10\
My wife at my side\
2:13\
was shaking her head in disapproval\
of my behavior.\
2:18\
My last resort then was to apologize to\
the guard and say I was very sorry\
2:25\
for treating him so badly.\
“You’re forgiven,” he said.\
2:33\
“But without a company ID, you’re\
not coming in today.”\
2:39\
I then drove very slowly\
back home to get my ID,\
2:44\
having perhaps learned\
this valuable lesson:\
2:47\
that when we choose not to be humble,\
we end up being humiliated.\
2:54\
In Proverbs, we find, “A man’s\
pride shall bring him low:\
2:59\
but honor shall uphold\
the humble in spirit.”\
3:04\
In order to develop humility,\
3:07\
we must understand what it really means\
in the context of the gospel.\
3:13\
Some people confuse being humble with\
other things, such as, for example,\
3:18\
being poor. But there are many,\
actually, that are poor and prideful,\
3:25\
and also many who are\
rich and yet humble.\
3:30\
Others who are very shy or have\
low self esteem may have\
3:36\
an outward appearance of humility,\
3:39\
but deep inside are full of pride\
sometimes. Then what is humility?\
3:46\
According to “Preach My Gospel,”\
3:48\
it is a “willingness to submit\
to the will of the Lord. ... It\
3:52\
is being teachable. ... [It] is a vital\
catalyst for spiritual growth.”\
4:00\
There are certainly many opportunities\
4:02\
for us all to improve in this\
Christlike attribute.\
4:07\
I would like to explore first how\
humble we've been or should be\
4:11\
in following the counsel\
of our prophets.\
4:16\
A pop quiz for us individually\
could be:\
4:20\
Do we mention the full name of the\
Church in all our interactions?\
4:25\
President Nelson said, quote,\
4:27\
“To remove the Lord’s name from the\
Lord’s Church is a major victory\
4:32\
for Satan,” unquote. Are we letting God\
prevail in our lives by accepting our\
4:39\
prophet's very specific invitation?\
Quote.\
4:42\
“Today I call upon our members\
everywhere to lead out in abandoning\
4:48\
attitudes and actions of prejudice,”\
unquote.\
4:53\
Are we overcoming the world,\
4:56\
trusting the doctrine of Christ more\
than the philosophies of men\
5:00\
as our prophet taught? Have\
we become peacemakers,\
5:05\
saying positive things\
to and about people?\
5:09\
President Nelson taught us\
last general conference\
5:12\
the following, quote: “If there\
is anything virtuous,\
5:16\
lovely, of good report, or praiseworthy\
that we can say about another person,\
5:24\
whether to his face or behind her back,\
5:27\
that should be our standard\
of communication,” unquote.\
5:32\
These are simple but powerful\
instructions.\
5:36\
Remember, all the people of Moses had\
to do to be healed was to look at\
5:42\
the brass serpent which\
he had lifted up.\
5:46\
But “because of the simpleness of\
the way, or the easiness of it,\
5:53\
there were many who perished.”\
During this conference,\
5:58\
we have heard and will yet hear the\
unfailing counsel of our prophets\
6:03\
and apostles. It's a perfect occasion\
to develop humility\
6:09\
and let our strong opinions\
be swallowed by\
6:13\
an even stronger conviction that\
6:15\
the Lord does speak through\
these chosen leaders.\
6:21\
Above all, in developing humility,\
6:23\
we must also understand and accept that\
we are not able to overcome our\
6:30\
challenges or to achieve our full\
potential through our own efforts only.\
6:38\
Motivational speakers, writers, coaches,\
and influencers around the world,\
6:44\
especially on digital platforms,\
6:47\
will say that everything depends\
solely on us and our actions.\
6:53\
The world believes in the arm of flesh.\
6:57\
But through the restored gospel,\
6:59\
we have learned that we greatly depend\
on Heavenly Father's benevolence\
7:05\
and the Atonement of our Savior,\
Jesus Christ, “For\
7:09\
we know that it is by grace that we\
are saved after all we can do.”\
7:16\
That’s why it’s so important to make\
and keep covenants with God,\
7:22\
as doing so will give us full\
access to the healing,\
7:25\
enabling, and perfecting power of Jesus\
Christ through His Atonement.\
7:31\
Attending sacrament meeting weekly and\
7:33\
worshipping at the temple regularly\
to participate in the ordinances\
7:37\
and to receive and renew covenants is a\
sign that we recognize our dependance\
7:43\
on Heavenly Father and our Savior Jesus\
Christ. That will invite Their power\
7:50\
into our lives to help us through all\
our problems and ultimately fulfill\
7:55\
the measure of our creation.\
Not long ago,\
8:00\
the level of my humility and\
understanding of my dependance\
8:05\
on the Lord was once again tested.\
8:09\
I was in a taxi going to the airport\
to catch a short flight to\
8:14\
a place where there was a very\
difficult situation to solve.\
8:20\
The taxi driver, who was not\
a member of the Church,\
8:24\
looked at me through the\
mirror and said,\
8:28\
“I can see you’re not well today.”\
“Could you tell?” I asked.\
8:34\
“Of course,” he said.\
Then he said something like,\
8:37\
“You actually have a very negative\
halo around you.”\
8:41\
I explained to him that I had quite\
a hard situation to deal with.\
8:46\
When he then asked me, “Have you done\
everything in your power to resolve\
8:51\
this?” I responded I had\
done everything I could.\
8:57\
He then said something\
I never forgot.\
9:01\
“So leave this in God’s hands and\
everything will work out fine.”\
9:08\
I confess that I was tempted to ask him,\
“Do you know who you’re talking to?”\
9:15\
But I didn’t. What I did\
was to humble myself\
9:21\
before the Lord throughout that one-\
hour flight asking for divine help.\
9:28\
As I left the airplane,\
I had learned that\
9:32\
the difficult situation to be\
solved was already in order and\
9:36\
that my presence there wouldn’t\
even be necessary anymore.\
9:42\
Brothers and sisters, the command,\
invitation, and promise from\
9:47\
the Lord is clear and comforting:\
“Be thou humble,\
9:53\
and the Lord thy God shall\
lead thee by the hand,\
9:56\
and give thee answer to thy prayers.”\
May we humble—\
10:01\
May we be humble to follow the\
counsel of our prophets\
10:05\
and accept that only God and Jesus\
Christ can transform us through\
10:10\
ordinances and covenants\
received in His Church\
10:15\
into our best version of\
ourselves in this life,\
10:19\
and one day make us perfect in Christ.\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
