My dear friends, we have had marvelous\
conference sessions today.\
0:07\
We have all felt the Spirit of\
the Lord and His love through\
0:11\
the wonderful messages shared\
by our leaders.\
0:15\
I feel privileged to address\
you this evening as\
0:18\
the concluding speaker of this session,\
0:21\
and I pray that the Spirit of\
the Lord continues with us\
0:25\
as we rejoice together as true brothers\
and sisters in Christ.\
0:31\
Our dear Prophet, Russell M.\
Nelson, declared:\
0:35\
“I call upon our members everywhere to\
lead out in abandoning attitudes\
0:41\
and actions of prejudice.\
0:43\
I plead with you to promote respect\
for all of God’s children.”\
0:50\
As a global and\
ever-growing church,\
0:53\
following this invitation from our\
Prophet is a vital prerequisite\
0:58\
for building the Savior's kingdom\
in every nation of the world.\
1:03\
The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches\
that we are all begotten spirit\
1:08\
sons and daughters of heavenly\
parents who truly loves us,\
1:13\
and that we lived as a family in God's\
presence before we were born\
1:20\
on this earth. The gospel also teaches\
that we were all created in the image\
1:26\
and likeness of God; therefore\
we are equal before Him,\
1:32\
for He “hath made of one blood\
all nations of men [and women].”\
1:38\
Therefore, we all have divine nature,\
heritage, and potential.\
1:44\
For there is “one God and Father of all,\
who is above all, and through all,\
1:52\
and in us all.” As disciples of Christ,\
1:57\
we are invited to increase our faith in\
and love for our spiritual brother\
2:02\
and sisterhood by genuinely knitting our\
hearts together in unity and love,\
2:08\
regardless of our differences,\
2:11\
thereby increasing our ability to\
promote respect for the dignity of all\
2:17\
the sons and daughters of God.\
2:20\
Wasn't that exactly the condition that\
the people of Nephi experienced\
2:26\
for almost two centuries after\
Christ ministered to them?\
2:32\
“And surely there could not\
be a happier people among\
2:36\
all people who had been created\
by the hand of God. ...\
2:41\
Neither were there Lamanites\
nor any manner of -ites,\
2:46\
but they were in one the children of\
Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.\
2:53\
And how blessed were they!”\
2:57\
President Nelson further emphasized the\
importance of spreading dignity\
3:02\
and respect for our fellow beings when\
he stated: “The Creator of all of us\
3:10\
calls on each of us to abandon attitudes\
of prejudice against any group of God’s\
3:16\
children. Any of us who has prejudice\
toward another race needs to repent. ...\
3:23\
It behooves each of us to do whatever we\
can in our spheres of influence to\
3:30\
preserve the dignity and respect every\
son and daughter of God deserves.”\
3:37\
In reality, human dignity presupposes\
respect for our differences.\
3:43\
Considering the sacred bond that unifies\
us with God as His children,\
3:48\
This prophetic direction given by\
President Nelson is undoubtedly\
3:54\
a fundamental step toward building\
bridges of understanding rather than\
3:59\
creating walls of prejudice\
and segregation among us.\
4:04\
However, as Paul warned the Ephesians,\
4:07\
we must recognize that in order\
to achieve this purpose,\
4:12\
it will be required to\
make an individual\
4:14\
and collective effort to\
act with lowliness,\
4:18\
meekness, and long-suffering\
toward one another.\
4:23\
There is a tale of a certain Jewish\
rabbi who was enjoying\
4:28\
the sunrise with two friends.\
4:30\
He asked them, “How do you know\
when the night is over and\
4:36\
a new day has begun?”\
One of them replied,\
4:40\
“When you can look into the east and\
can distinguish a sheep from\
4:45\
a goat.” The other then responded,\
4:48\
“When you can look into the horizon and\
distinguish an olive tree from\
4:54\
a fig tree.” They then turned to\
the wise rabbi and asked him the\
5:00\
same question. After long reflection,\
he replied,\
5:05\
“When you can look into\
the east and see\
5:16\
the face of a man and can say ‘she\
is my sister; he is my brother.’”\
5:26\
My dear friends, I can assure\
you that the light of\
5:31\
a new day shines brighter in our lives\
5:34\
when we see and treat our fellow beings\
with respect and dignity and\
5:40\
as true brothers and sisters in Christ.\
5:43\
During His earthly ministry,\
5:46\
Jesus so perfectly exemplified this\
principle as He went about doing good\
5:52\
unto all people, inviting\
them to come unto Him\
5:56\
and partake of His goodness regardless\
of their origin,\
6:01\
social class, or\
cultural characteristics.\
6:05\
He ministered, healed, and was always\
attentive to everyone’s needs,\
6:11\
especially those who at the time\
were considered different,\
6:15\
belittled, or excluded. He denied none,\
but treated them with equity and love,\
6:24\
for He saw them as His\
brothers and sisters,\
6:27\
sons and daughters of the same Father.\
6:31\
One of the most striking occasions\
when this occurred was when\
6:36\
the Savior traveled to Galilee,\
6:39\
purposely taking the route which\
passed through Samaria.\
6:44\
Jesus then decided to sit by\
Jacob’s well to rest.\
6:48\
While there a Samaritan woman approached\
it to fill her pitcher with water.\
6:54\
In His omniscience, Jesus addressed\
her saying, “Give me to drink.”\
7:01\
This woman was amazed that a Jew had\
asked a Samaritan woman for assistance\
7:08\
and expressed her surprise, saying,\
7:11\
“How is that thou, being a Jew, asks\
drink of me, which am a woman of\
7:20\
Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings\
with the Samaritans.”\
7:24\
But Jesus, abandoning the long-held\
traditions of animosity between\
7:30\
Samaritans and Jews, lovingly\
ministered to this woman,\
7:34\
helping her to understand\
who He truly was—\
7:38\
that is the Messiah, who\
would tell all things\
7:42\
and whose coming she was awaiting.\
7:46\
The impact of that tender ministry\
caused the woman to run into the city,\
7:52\
to announce to the people\
what had happened,\
7:54\
saying,“Is not this the Christ?”\
7:59\
I have deep compassion for those\
who have been mistreated,\
8:04\
belittled, or persecuted by unfeeling\
and thoughtless people,\
8:09\
because in the course of my life,\
8:12\
I've seen firsthand the pain good\
people suffer from being judged\
8:17\
or dismissed because they happen to\
speak, look, or live differently.\
8:23\
I also feel genuine sorrow in my\
heart for those whose minds\
8:28\
remain darkened,\
whose vision is limited,\
8:32\
and whose hearts remain hardened\
by the belief in\
8:36\
the inferiority of those who\
are different from them.\
8:40\
Their limited view of others actually\
obstructs their ability to see who they\
8:46\
are as children of God. As\
foretold by the prophets,\
8:52\
we are living in the perilous days\
leading up to the Second Coming of\
8:57\
the Savior. The world in general\
is polarized by strong divisions\
9:03\
accentuated by racial, political,\
and socioeconomic lines.\
9:08\
Such divisions sometimes end up\
influencing people's way of thinking\
9:14\
and acting in relation to\
their fellow being.\
9:18\
For this reason, it is not uncommon to\
see people characterizing their way\
9:24\
of thinking, acting, and speaking\
of other cultures,\
9:28\
races, and ethnicities as inferior;\
making use of preconceived,\
9:35\
mistaken, and often sarcastic ideas;\
generating attitudes of contempt,\
9:41\
indifference, disrespect, and even\
prejudice against them.\
9:47\
Such attitudes have their roots in\
pride, arrogance, envy, and jealousy.\
9:54\
Characteristics of a carnal nature\
which are totally contrary to\
9:59\
Christlike attributes. This\
conduct is improper\
10:04\
for those who are striving to\
become His true disciples.\
10:09\
In fact, my dear brothers and sisters,\
10:12\
there is no place for prejudiced\
thoughts or actions in\
10:17\
the community of Saints. As sons\
and daughters of the covenant,\
10:22\
we can help to eliminate this kind\
of behavior by looking at\
10:27\
the apparent differences that exist\
between us with the Savior's eyes\
10:32\
and based on what we have in common—\
our divine identity and kinship.\
10:39\
Moreover, we can strive to see ourselves\
reflected in the dreams,\
10:44\
hopes, sorrows, and pains\
of our neighbor.\
10:49\
We are all fellow travelers as God’s\
children, equal in our imperfect state\
10:56\
and in our ability to grow.\
10:58\
We are invited to walk together\
peaceably with our hearts filled with\
11:04\
love toward God and all men.\
11:07\
Or, as Abraham Lincoln noted, “With\
malice toward none and charity for all.”\
11:16\
Have you ever pondered on how\
the principle of respect\
11:20\
for human dignity and equality is\
demonstrated through\
11:25\
the simple way we dress in\
the house of the Lord?\
11:29\
We all come to the temple\
united in one purpose,\
11:33\
filled with the desire to be pure\
and holy in His holy presence.\
11:39\
Dressed in white, all of us are\
received by the Lord Himself\
11:44\
as His beloved children, men and women\
of God, progeny of Christ.\
11:51\
We are privileged to perform the same\
ordinances, make the same covenants,\
11:56\
commit ourselves to live higher\
and holier lives,\
12:01\
and receive the same eternal\
promises. United in purpose,\
12:06\
we see one another with new eyes,\
12:09\
and in our oneness we celebrate our\
differences as divine children of God.\
12:16\
I recently helped guide dignitaries\
and government officials through\
12:20\
the open house for the Brasilia\
Brazil Temple.\
12:24\
I paused in the changing area with\
the Vice President of Brazil,\
12:29\
and we discussed the white clothing that\
everyone wears inside the temple.\
12:34\
I explained to him that this universal\
use of white clothing symbolizes that\
12:40\
we are all alike unto God, and that in\
12:44\
the temple our identities were not\
vice president of a country or\
12:49\
a church leader, but our eternal\
identity as sons\
12:55\
of a loving Heavenly Father.\
12:59\
The Iguazu River flows through southern\
Brazil and empties into\
13:05\
a plateau that forms a system of\
waterfalls known worldwide as\
13:11\
the Iguazu Falls, one of\
the most beautiful\
13:15\
and impressive of God’s\
creations on earth,\
13:18\
considered one of the seven\
Wonders of the World.\
13:21\
A colossal volume of water\
flows into a single river\
13:26\
and then separates forming hundreds\
of unparalleled waterfalls.\
13:32\
Metaphorically speaking, this phenomenal\
system of waterfalls is\
13:37\
a reflection of God’s family on Earth,\
13:41\
for we share the same spiritual origin\
13:44\
and substance derived from our\
divine heritage and kinship.\
13:50\
However, each of us flows in different\
cultures and ethnicities\
13:55\
and nationalities with different\
opinions, experiences, and feelings.\
14:01\
Despite this, we move forward as\
God's children and as brothers\
14:07\
and sisters in Christ without losing\
our divine connection,\
14:12\
which makes us a unique people\
and a beloved community.\
14:18\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
14:20\
may we align our hearts and\
minds with the knowledge\
14:24\
and testimony that we are\
all equal before God,\
14:28\
that we are all fully endowed with\
the same eternal potential\
14:33\
and inheritance. May we enjoy more\
14:36\
the spiritual kinship that exists\
between us and value\
14:41\
the different attributes and\
varied gifts we all have.\
14:46\
If we do so, I promise you that\
we will flow in our own way,\
14:52\
as does the water of the Iguazu\
Falls, without losing our divine\
14:58\
connection that identifies\
us as a peculiar people,\
15:02\
the children of Christ and heirs\
of the Kingdom of God.\
15:08\
I testify to you that as we continue to\
flow this way during our mortal life,\
15:14\
a new day will begin with a new light\
15:19\
that will brighten our lives\
15:22\
and illuminate wonderful opportunities\
to value more\
15:26\
and be more fully blessed by\
15:28\
the diversity created by\
God among His children.\
15:33\
We will surely become instruments\
in His hands to promote respect\
15:38\
and dignity among all His sons\
and daughters. God lives.\
15:43\
Jesus is the Savior of the world.\
15:46\
President Nelson is the prophet\
of God in our day.\
15:51\
I bear witness of these truths in the\
sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
