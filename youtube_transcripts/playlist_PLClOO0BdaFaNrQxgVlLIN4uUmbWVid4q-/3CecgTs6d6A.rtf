A few years ago when I was serving in\
the South America Northwest area\
0:06\
and living in Peru, I had a\
beautiful experience that\
0:09\
I would like to share with you.\
0:11\
It happened when I was returning home\
after a busy weekend of assignments.\
0:16\
After finally completing the airport\
immigration process,\
0:20\
I found a friendly taxi driver waiting\
for me from our usual taxi service.\
0:27\
He took me to his car and\
I sat in the back,\
0:29\
ready to relax and enjoy\
a quiet trip home.\
0:32\
After driving a few blocks,\
0:34\
the driver received a phone\
call from his supervisor,\
0:37\
telling him I took the wrong taxi.\
0:39\
A different car was reserved for me and\
0:42\
the supervisor asked him to take\
me back to the airport if\
0:45\
I wanted to change cars.\
I told him\
0:49\
it was not necessary and\
we could keep going.\
0:53\
After a few minutes of silence,\
0:55\
he looked at me through the\
rearview mirror and asked.\
0:59\
You are Mormon, aren't you?\
1:02\
Well, after that inviting question,\
I knew my quiet moments were over.\
1:08\
I could not resist exploring where\
his question would take us.\
1:14\
I learned that his name was Omar.\
1:16\
His wife's name was Maria Theresa, and\
they had two children, Karolina,\
1:19\
aged 14, and Rodrigo, aged 10.\
1:23\
Omar had been a member of the\
Church since he was a child.\
1:26\
His family was active, but at some point\
his parents stopped going to\
1:31\
church. Omar became completely\
inactive when he was 15.\
1:36\
He was then 40 years old.\
1:39\
At that moment, I realize I did\
not take the wrong taxi.\
1:43\
It was not a coincidence.\
1:46\
I told him who I was and that\
I was in his taxi because\
1:49\
the Lord was calling him\
back to His fold.\
1:53\
We then talked about the time he and\
his family were active members of\
1:56\
the Church. He had fond memories\
of sweet family home\
2:01\
evening moments and some Primary songs.\
2:04\
He then softly sang a few words\
of “I Am a Child of God.”\
2:11\
After getting his address, phone number,\
and permission to share with his bishop,\
2:16\
I told him I will find a\
way to be in the chapel\
2:20\
on his first day back to church.\
2:23\
We finished our trip from\
the airport to my home as well as\
2:28\
our little trip to his past. And\
we went our separate ways.\
2:34\
A few weeks later, his bishop called me,\
2:36\
telling me Omar was planning to attend\
church on a certain Sunday.\
2:40\
I told him I will be there. That Sunday,\
Omar was there with his son.\
2:46\
His wife and daughter were\
not yet interested.\
2:50\
A few months later, his bishop\
called me again,\
2:53\
this time to tell me that Omar will be\
baptizing his wife and his two children,\
3:01\
and invited me to be there.\
3:03\
Here is the picture of that Sunday where\
they were confirmed members of\
3:07\
the Church. That same Sunday,\
3:11\
I told Omar and his family that if\
they were prepared, in one year,\
3:15\
I would be honored to perform their\
sealing in the Lima Temple.\
3:20\
Here is a picture of that\
memorable moment\
3:22\
for all of us taken one year later.\
3:27\
Why I’m sharing this experience with\
you: I’m sharing for two purposes.\
3:33\
First, to address those\
good members that\
3:36\
for some reason have fallen away from\
3:39\
the restored gospel of Jesus\
Christ, and second,\
3:43\
to also address those participating\
members today who maybe are not being\
3:49\
as faithful to their covenants\
as they should be.\
3:53\
In both cases, generations ahead of\
them are impacted in blessings\
3:58\
and promises that were reserved for\
their posterity are at risk.\
4:05\
Let's start with the first scenario.\
4:08\
Good members who left the covenant path,\
4:11\
as happened with my Peruvian\
friend Omar.\
4:15\
When I asked him why he\
decided to return,\
4:18\
he said it was because he\
4:20\
and his wife felt their children\
would be happier in life with\
4:24\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
4:26\
He felt it was about time to go back to\
church for the sake of their children.\
4:34\
It is so sad when we come across\
inactive members or new members of\
4:38\
the Church who at one time had the\
gospel within their families\
4:43\
and lost it because of their parents’\
or grandparents’ decision to take\
4:48\
a break from the Church. Their\
decision could have an impact\
4:52\
on their posterity forever.\
4:56\
Their children and grandchildren have\
been precluded from the protection\
4:59\
and the blessings of the gospel of\
Jesus Christ in their lives.\
5:04\
Even more heartbreaking, they have lost\
5:08\
the promises of eternal family\
which were there one day.\
5:13\
The decision of one has impacted\
a whole chain of descendants.\
5:18\
A legacy of faith has been broken.\
5:23\
However, as we know, anything broken\
can be mended through Jesus Christ.\
5:27\
For this reason, please consider\
this invitation from\
5:30\
President Russell M. Nelson:\
5:32\
Now, if you have stepped off the path,\
5:35\
may I invite you with all the hope\
of my heart to please come back?\
5:39\
Whatever your concerns, whatever\
your challenges,\
5:42\
there is a place for you in this,\
the Lord’s church.\
5:46\
You and generations yet unborn will be\
blessed by your actions now to return\
5:53\
to the covenant path.\
5:56\
Well, now let's address\
the second scenario.\
6:00\
Today's participating members who\
maybe are not being as faithful\
6:04\
as they should be. Just as yesterday’s\
decisions impact today’s realities,\
6:11\
decisions of today will\
impact our future and\
6:14\
the future of our family members.\
6:17\
President Oaks taught us, The restored\
gospel of Jesus Christ\
6:23\
encourages us to think about the future.\
6:25\
It teaches great ideas about the future\
to guide our actions today.\
6:30\
In contrast, we all know persons who are\
concerned only with the present.\
6:35\
Spend it today, enjoy it today, and\
take no thought for the future.\
6:42\
As we make current decisions, we should\
always be asking, Where will this lead?\
6:50\
Will our current decisions lead us\
to joy now and in eternity,\
6:55\
or will they lead us to\
sorrow and tears?\
6:58\
Some may think, we don’t need\
to attend church every Sunday,\
7:02\
or we will pay tithing when\
things get better,\
7:06\
or, I will not support the Church\
leaders in this subject,\
7:11\
but they say, we know the Church is\
true and we will never leave\
7:16\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
7:18\
Those with thoughts like\
this do not realize\
7:22\
the negative impact this lukewarm type\
of membership will have on their lives\
7:29\
and the lives of their posterity.\
7:32\
The parents may remain active,\
7:35\
but the risk of losing their children is\
high in this life and in eternity.\
7:42\
Regarding those who will not inherit\
celestial glory with their families\
7:46\
the Lord says, These are they who are\
not valiant in the testimony of Jesus,\
7:53\
wherefore they obtain not a crown\
over the kingdom of our God.\
8:00\
Is that what we want for ourselves\
or our children?\
8:04\
Shouldn't we be more valiant and less\
lukewarm for our own sake and for\
8:10\
the sake of our posterity?\
8:14\
President Ballard also addressed a\
similar concern: For some, Christ’s\
8:20\
invitation to believe and remain\
continues to be hard.\
8:23\
Some disciples struggle to understand\
a specific Church policy or teaching.\
8:28\
Others find concern in our history or\
in the imperfections of some members\
8:33\
and leaders past and present.\
8:37\
The decision to walk no more\
with Church members and\
8:41\
the Lord's chosen leaders will have\
8:43\
a long-term impact that cannot\
always be seen right now.\
8:50\
What a sad legacy to pass along,\
and for what reason?\
8:55\
Whatever it is, it isn't\
enough to ignore\
8:59\
the negative spiritual impact it will\
create for generations ahead.\
9:06\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
9:08\
if you are going through one\
of these two situations\
9:10\
I mentioned in my message, please\
reconsider your course of action.\
9:17\
You know there is a plan\
for us in this life.\
9:20\
You know that families can be eternal.\
Why put yours at risk?\
9:25\
Don't be the weak link in this beautiful\
chain of faith you started\
9:32\
or you received as a legacy.\
Be the strong one.\
9:35\
It is your turn to do it, and\
the Lord can help you.\
9:39\
From the bottom of my heart, I\
invite you to think about it,\
9:43\
to look ahead and evaluate where this\
will lead, and if it’s necessary,\
9:49\
be valiant enough to reshape your path\
for the sake of your posterity.\
9:55\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
