Do you want to be happy?\
What makes you unhappy?\
0:06\
President Nelson said, “If\
you want to be miserable,\
0:11\
break the commandments—and never repent.\
If you want joy, stay\
0:16\
on the covenant path.” End of quote.\
Isn’t it simple to be happy?\
0:21\
Just make covenants and keep\
them in your lives.\
0:25\
Let us review some things that can help\
us to stay on the covenant path\
0:30\
and make us happy. One. What\
is the covenant path?\
0:36\
According to Elder Dale G. Renlund,\
0:39\
“The term covenant path\
refers to a series of\
0:44\
covenants whereby we come to\
Christ and connect to Him.\
0:50\
Through this covenant bond, we have\
access to His eternal power. The path\
0:56\
begins with faith in Jesus\
Christ and repentance,\
1:00\
followed by baptism and receiving the\
gift of the Holy Ghost.” End of quote.\
1:06\
We renew these covenants\
every time we partake of the sacrament.\
1:12\
Beginning with the baptismal covenant,\
1:15\
we make more covenants throughout\
our lives. Again,\
1:19\
Elder Renlund said, “The covenant path\
leads to the ordinances of the temple,\
1:25\
such as the temple endowment.\
1:28\
The endowment is God's gift of sacred\
covenants that connect us more fully\
1:34\
to Him.” Two. Are you on\
the covenant path?\
1:38\
Sometimes when we make covenants,\
we fail to keep them.\
1:43\
When this happens, how can you\
return to the covenant path?\
1:47\
Let me share some examples of returning\
to the covenant path.\
1:52\
A little over a month ago,\
1:54\
I received a message from a return\
missionary who served with us.\
1:59\
He said, “The last while has been tough.\
Battling anxiety and depression\
2:05\
every day has been weighing me down,\
and it is very difficult.\
2:10\
I feel alone and just miserable.\
2:14\
I have been praying for the guidance\
of our Heavenly Father for peace\
2:18\
and comfort in what I can do\
to battle the hardship. ...\
2:22\
While I was praying, I\
felt the prompting of\
2:26\
the Spirit telling me that I needed\
to be paying my tithing in full. ...\
2:33\
I felt the Spirit so strongly and I\
immediately felt the urge to do so.\
2:40\
With the desire to do so,\
2:41\
I felt a prompting that ‘If you pay your\
tithing, everything will be okay.’\
2:47\
I'm still struggling to find peace,\
2:50\
but I do have a testimony in our Savior\
and that through my obedience\
2:56\
I can feel and find the peace I am\
looking for in my heart and mind.\
3:02\
I have recently decided to come back\
to the Church and to seek\
3:09\
the Spirit in all that I do.” End of\
quote. Now he is doing very well.\
3:16\
You also may ask Heavenly\
Father for peace,\
3:18\
but the answer may be different than\
what you anticipate it will be.\
3:24\
As long as you seek to know of the\
Savior and pray to Heavenly Father,\
3:29\
He will give you a customized\
answer for you.\
3:33\
President Monson taught, “The greatest\
lesson we can learn in mortality is\
3:40\
that when God speaks and we obey,\
we will always be right.”\
3:45\
“When we keep the commandments,\
3:47\
our lives will be happier, more\
fulfilling, and less complicated.\
3:53\
Our challenges and problems will\
be easier to bear, and\
3:58\
we will receive God’s promised\
blessings.”\
4:03\
When I was called to be a bishop,\
4:06\
it was during the most difficult\
time of my life.\
4:10\
I was a young father in my early 30s,\
4:13\
but I was in trouble financially\
because of family challenges.\
4:18\
I couldn't find any solution\
and I thought\
4:21\
the challenges would never end. I was\
exhausted financially and emotionally.\
4:27\
I started doubting my spiritual\
strength as well.\
4:31\
It was at that difficult time\
4:33\
that my stake president extended\
the calling to me.\
4:37\
I accepted the call anyway,\
although it was hard.\
4:41\
My wife also had an interview\
with the stake president,\
4:46\
but she could not say yes and\
she did not say no either,\
4:51\
but kept shedding tears. She\
cried for the whole week\
4:56\
asking Heavenly Father, “Why now?” and\
“Do you really know each individual?”\
5:03\
She didn't get an answer,\
5:05\
but I was sustained as a bishop\
on the following Sunday.\
5:09\
She did not ask Heavenly Father\
those questions anymore,\
5:13\
but supported me in my calling\
for six years.\
5:17\
On the Sunday when I was released,\
5:20\
my wife heard a voice while she\
was receiving the sacrament.\
5:25\
The voice whispered to her, “Because\
it was too hard for you to walk,\
5:31\
I called him as a bishop in order\
to hold you and walk for you.”\
5:37\
Looking back at the past six years,\
5:40\
she realized that all the many\
challenges that seem to be endless had\
5:46\
now been resolved along the way.\
5:49\
We learned that when we think\
it is not a good time for us to receive\
5:54\
a calling, it may be the time we\
need that calling the most.\
6:00\
Whenever the Lord asks us\
to serve in any calling,\
6:03\
whether it is a light or a heavy\
calling, He sees our needs.\
6:08\
He provides the strength we need\
6:12\
and has blessings ready to be poured\
out upon us as we faithfully serve.\
6:18\
There are many other things that\
distract us from the staying on\
6:22\
the covenant path. No matter what it is,\
6:25\
it is never too late to turn our heart\
to Heavenly Father for help.\
6:31\
Elder Paul V. Johnson taught us, “When\
we follow Satan, we give him power.\
6:38\
When we follow God, He gives us power.”\
6:42\
King Benjamin in the Book\
of Mormon testifies,\
6:45\
“I would desire that ye should\
consider on the blessed\
6:49\
and happy state of those that keep\
the commandments of God.\
6:54\
For behold, they are blessed in all\
things, both temporal and spiritual;\
7:01\
and if they hold out faithful\
to the end,\
7:04\
they are received into heaven, that\
thereby they may dwell with God in\
7:10\
a state of never-ending happiness.”\
Three.\
7:14\
How can keeping covenants\
with God make you happy?\
7:19\
My wife says that our marriage\
yokes us together and\
7:23\
because of that she can do things\
she couldn't do before.\
7:26\
For example, ever since she was young,\
7:30\
she had a hard time going\
out in the dark.\
7:34\
But it is not hard anymore\
because I go with her.\
7:39\
She is short and cannot reach to the\
high shelves unless she uses\
7:44\
a chair or ladder. But I can reach the\
things from high shelves for her\
7:50\
because I am taller than her.\
7:54\
Taking our Savior’s yoke\
upon us is like that.\
7:58\
As we yoke ourselves to Him,\
8:00\
we can do things we couldn’t do\
on our own because He can do\
8:05\
the things we cannot do for ourselves.\
8:09\
Elder David A. Bednar, said, “Making\
8:12\
and keeping sacred covenants yokes us\
to and with the Lord Jesus Christ.\
8:18\
In essence, the Savior is beckoning\
us to rely upon\
8:24\
and pull together with Him,\
8:26\
even though our best efforts\
are not equal to\
8:30\
and cannot be compared with His. As we\
trust in and pull our load with Him\
8:36\
during the journey of mortality, truly\
His yoke is easy and His burden is\
8:45\
light.” President Nelson also taught,\
“Yoking yourself with\
8:49\
the Savior means you have access to\
His strength and redeeming power. ...\
8:54\
The reward for keeping covenants\
with God is heavenly power—\
8:59\
power that strengthen us\
to withstand our trials,\
9:02\
temptations, and heartaches better.\
9:07\
This power eases our way.\
9:10\
Those who live the higher laws of\
9:12\
the Jesus Christ have access\
to His higher power. ...\
9:16\
Keeping covenants actually\
makes life easier!\
9:20\
Each person who makes covenants in\
baptismal fonts and in temples—\
9:25\
and keeps them—has increased access\
to the power of Jesus Christ.”\
9:31\
End of quote. My dear brothers and\
sisters, do you want to be happy?\
9:37\
Stay on the covenant path.\
9:38\
Your life will be easier, happier,\
and filled with joy.\
9:44\
Our Savior is inviting us, “Come unto me\
all ye that labor and are heavy laden,\
9:52\
and I will give you rest.”\
He is the living Christ.\
9:57\
He carries our burdens and\
makes our life easier.\
10:01\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
10:13\
Six years ago, our family was traveling\
at night just outside\
10:18\
the city of Oxford. As is often\
the case with young children,\
10:21\
we needed to stop, so we found\
a service station with\
10:25\
an array of shops and restaurants.\
10:27\
With precision, we filed out of the car,\
10:30\
visited the services, and filed\
back in, resuming our journey.\
10:36\
Fifteen minutes later, our eldest son\
asked a significant question: “Where is\
10:46\
Jasper?” Jasper sits on his own at\
the back of the car.\
10:49\
We assumed he had fallen asleep or\
was hiding or playing a trick\
10:53\
on us. As his brother inspected the\
back of the car more closely,\
10:57\
we discovered our five-year-old\
son was not there.\
11:03\
Our hearts filled with dread.\
11:05\
As we made our way back to\
the service station,\
11:07\
we pleaded with Heavenly Father that\
Jasper would be kept safe.\
11:11\
We called the police and informed\
them of the situation.\
11:15\
When we anxiously arrived, more\
than 40 minutes later,\
11:19\
we found two police vehicles in the\
car park, lights flashing. Inside\
11:25\
one of them was Jasper, playing\
with the buttons.\
11:32\
I will never forget the joy we felt\
in being reunited with him.\
11:39\
Many of the Savior's parabolic\
teachings focus on gathering,\
11:44\
restoring, or striving to find that\
which has been scattered or lost.\
11:50\
Among these are the parables\
of the lost sheep,\
11:53\
the lost coin, and the lost son.\
11:57\
As this incident with Jasper has played\
in my mind over the years,\
12:01\
I have reflected on the divine identity\
and importance of God's children,\
12:07\
the redemptive power of Jesus Christ,\
12:09\
and the perfect love of a Father\
in Heaven who knows you and me.\
12:15\
I hope to bear witness of these truths\
today. Firstly, Children of God.\
12:22\
Life is challenging. Many people\
feel overwhelmed, alone,\
12:26\
isolated, or exhausted. When\
things are difficult,\
12:30\
we may feel that we have wandered\
or fallen behind.\
12:34\
Knowing that we are all children of God\
12:37\
and members of His eternal family will\
restore a sense of belonging\
12:42\
and purpose. President Ballard shared:\
12:46\
“There is one important identity\
we all share now and forever. ...\
12:52\
That is that you are and have always\
been a son or daughter of God. ...\
12:58\
Understanding this truth—\
13:00\
really understanding it and embracing\
it—is life-changing.”\
13:06\
Do not misunderstand or devalue how\
important you are to your Father in\
13:11\
Heaven. You are not an accidental\
byproduct of nature, a cosmic orphan,\
13:19\
or the result of matter\
plus time plus chance.\
13:24\
Where there is design,\
there is a designer.\
13:28\
Your life has meaning and purpose.\
13:32\
The ongoing Restoration of the gospel\
of Jesus Christ brings light\
13:36\
and understanding regarding\
your divine identity.\
13:40\
You are a beloved child\
of Heavenly Father.\
13:44\
You are the subject matter of all\
these parables and teachings.\
13:48\
God loves you so much that He sent His\
Son to heal, rescue, and redeem you.\
13:55\
Jesus Christ recognized the divine\
nature and eternal worth of each person.\
14:00\
He explained how the two great\
commandments to love God\
14:03\
and love our neighbor are\
14:05\
the foundation of all of\
God's commandments.\
14:08\
One of our divine responsibilities\
is to care for those in need.\
14:14\
This is why, as disciples of Jesus\
Christ, we “bear one another’s burdens,\
14:19\
... mourn with those that mourn, ...\
and comfort\
14:22\
those that stand in need of comfort.”\
14:26\
Religion is not only about our\
relationship with God;\
14:30\
it is also about our relationship\
with each other.\
14:34\
Elder Holland explained that the English\
word “religion” comes from\
14:37\
the Latin “religare” meaning “to tie”\
or more literally, “to retie.”\
14:43\
Thus, “true religion is the tie that\
binds us to God and to each other.”\
14:52\
How we treat one another truly matters.\
14:54\
President Nelson teaches, “The Savior’s\
message is clear: His true disciples\
15:00\
build, lift, encourage,\
persuade, and inspire.”\
15:07\
This is even more important when our\
fellow travelers feel lost, alone,\
15:13\
forgotten, or removed. We do not have\
to look far to find people who are\
15:19\
struggling. We can start by helping\
someone in our own family,\
15:24\
congregation, or local community.\
15:27\
We can also seek to relieve\
the suffering of\
15:30\
the 700 million people living\
in extreme poverty,\
15:34\
or the 100 million people who are\
forcibly displaced due to persecution,\
15:40\
conflict, and identity-based violence.\
15:45\
Jesus Christ is the perfect example\
of caring for those in need—\
15:50\
the hungry, the stranger, the sick,\
the poor, the imprisoned.\
15:57\
His work is our work. Elder Gong teaches\
that “our journey to God is\
16:06\
often found together.” As such,\
16:09\
our ward should be a refuge\
for all of God's children.\
16:13\
Are we passively attending church\
16:15\
or actively creating communities\
whose purpose is to worship,\
16:20\
remember Christ, and minister\
to one another?\
16:23\
We can heed President Nelson's counsel\
to judge less, love more,\
16:31\
and extend the pure love of Jesus Christ\
through our words and actions.\
16:37\
Two. The redemptive power\
of Jesus Christ.\
16:40\
The Atonement of Jesus Christ is\
16:42\
the supreme expression of our Heavenly\
Father's love for His children.\
16:46\
The word “atonement” describes\
16:48\
the setting “at one” of those who have\
been estranged or separated.\
16:53\
Our Savior's mission\
was to provide both\
16:55\
a way to return to Heavenly Father\
and relief in the journey.\
17:00\
The Savior knows through His experience\
17:02\
how to support us through\
life's challenges.\
17:06\
Make no mistake, Christ is our Rescuer\
and the Healer of our souls.\
17:13\
As we exercise faith, He helps us\
press forward through hardships.\
17:18\
He continues to extend His loving\
and merciful invitation:\
17:22\
“Come unto me all ye that labor and are\
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\
17:29\
Take my yoke upon you and learn of me;\
... and ye shall find rest unto your\
17:37\
souls.” The metaphor of the yoke\
is powerful. As President\
17:41\
Howard W. Hunter explained, “The yoke\
was a device that allowed the ‘strength’\
17:46\
of a second animal to be linked and\
coupled with the effort of a\
17:50\
single animal, sharing and reducing the\
heavy labor of the task in hand.\
17:57\
A burden that was overwhelming\
or perhaps impossible\
18:02\
for one to bear could be equitably\
and comfortably borne by two\
18:08\
bound together with a common yoke.”\
18:12\
Present Nelson taught: “You come unto\
Christ to be yoked with Him\
18:17\
and with His power, so that you’re\
not pulling life’s load alone.\
18:22\
You’re pulling life’s load yoked with\
the Savior and Redeemer of the world.”\
18:28\
How do we yoke or bind ourselves\
to the Savior?\
18:32\
Elder Bednar explains: “Making\
18:34\
and keeping sacred covenants yokes us\
to and with the Lord Jesus Christ.\
18:40\
In essence, the Savior is beckoning\
us to rely upon\
18:46\
and pull together with Him. ... We are\
not and never need be alone.”\
18:55\
To any one burdened, lost, confused,\
you do not have to do this alone.\
19:03\
Through the Atonement of Christ\
and His ordinances,\
19:06\
you can be yoked or bound to Him.\
19:08\
He will lovingly provide the strength\
and healing you need to face\
19:13\
the journey ahead. He is the refuge\
from our storms still.\
19:20\
Third. Heavenly Father’s love.\
19:24\
For the record, Jasper is witty,\
affectionate,\
19:29\
intelligent, and rambunctious.\
But the key to the story is\
19:38\
he is mine.\
19:42\
He is my son. And I love him more\
than he will ever know.\
19:52\
If an imperfect, earthly father feels\
this way about his child,\
19:58\
can you imagine how a perfect,\
glorified, loving\
20:02\
Heavenly Father feels about you?\
20:07\
To my dear friends of the rising\
generation, Gen Z and Gen Alpha:\
20:12\
please know faith requires work.\
20:15\
We live in a time when, for many,\
only seeing is believing.\
20:20\
Faith can be challenging\
and requires choices.\
20:24\
But prayers are answered and\
answers can be felt.\
20:29\
Some of the most real things\
in life are not seen.\
20:34\
They are felt, known, and experienced.\
They, too, are real.\
20:42\
Jesus Christ wants you to know and have\
20:45\
a relationship with your\
Father in Heaven.\
20:47\
He taught: “What man among\
you, having a son,\
20:51\
and he shall be standing out,\
and shall say, Father,\
20:55\
open thy house that I may come in\
and sup with thee, will not say,\
21:01\
Come in, my son; for mine is thine,\
and thine is mine.”\
21:08\
Can you think of a more personal, loving\
image of God, the Eternal Father?\
21:14\
You are His child. If you\
are feeling lost,\
21:19\
if you have questions or lack wisdom,\
21:21\
if you are struggling with\
your circumstances,\
21:24\
or wrestling with spiritual dissonance,\
turn to Him.\
21:30\
Pray to Him for comfort, love, answers,\
and direction. Whatever the need\
21:37\
and wherever you are, pour out your\
heart to your Heavenly Father.\
21:43\
For some, you may want to follow\
President Nelson's invitation\
21:46\
and “ask if He is really there—\
21:50\
If He knows you. Ask Him how He feels\
about you and then listen.”\
21:58\
Dear brothers and sisters: Know\
your Father in Heaven.\
22:02\
He is perfect and loving. Know\
who Jesus Christ is.\
22:07\
He is our Savior and Redeemer.\
22:09\
Bind yourself and those you love\
to Him and know who you are.\
22:14\
Know your true divine identity. God's\
plan of happiness is all about you.\
22:20\
You are His precious child\
and of great worth.\
22:23\
He knows and loves you. Of these simple\
but foundational truths\
22:28\
I testify, in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
22:42\
We are grateful for all who have spoken\
to us this afternoon and for\
22:48\
the beautiful music that\
has been provided.\
22:52\
We remind you of the Saturday\
evening general session,\
22:57\
which will be broadcast from\
22:59\
the Conference Center this evening\
at 6 p.m. mountain daylight time.\
23:06\
The nationwide broadcast of Music and\
23:09\
the Spoken Word will air tomorrow\
morning from 9:30 to 10 a.m.\
23:16\
mountain daylight time. The Sunday\
morning session of conference will\
23:21\
immediately follow. Our\
concluding speaker\
23:26\
for this session will be Elder Ronald\
A. Rasband of the Quorum of\
23:31\
the Twelve Apostles.\
Following his remarks,\
23:35\
the choir will sing “Praise\
to the Lord, the Almighty.”\
23:40\
The benediction will then be offered\
by Sister Andrea M. Spannaus,\
23:45\
who serves as Second Counselor in the\
Young Women General Presidency.\
24:02\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
24:04\
my thoughts today are on the\
gathering of Israel,\
24:08\
what President Russell M. Nelson calls\
“the most important thing taking place\
24:14\
on earth today. Nothing else\
compares in magnitude,\
24:18\
nothing else compares in importance,\
nothing else compares in majesty.”\
24:25\
The gathering is the ultimate\
recognition that\
24:28\
“the worth of souls is great\
in the sight of God.”\
24:32\
It is as simple as that. We are\
gathering God's children in these last\
24:37\
days that they might have “blessings\
poured out upon their heads” and\
24:43\
the promises of\
“the riches of eternity.”\
24:47\
It follows that to gather Israel,\
24:50\
we need missionaries—many\
more than are serving.\
24:55\
Today I am speaking to the\
many seasoned seniors in\
25:00\
the Church who could serve as\
missionaries. The Lord needs you.\
25:05\
We need you in New York and Chicago,\
Australia and Africa,\
25:10\
Thailand and Mexico, and\
everywhere in between.\
25:16\
Let me take you back to the year 2015.\
25:20\
I was a newly called member of the\
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\
25:25\
One of the wonderful responsibilities\
we carry\
25:28\
as apostles is to assign missionaries\
to their fields of labor.\
25:33\
I had participated as a Seventy in the\
process, but now as an Apostle,\
25:39\
I felt the full weight\
of the assignment.\
25:43\
I began with prayerfully placing\
a great number of young elders\
25:48\
and sisters, one by one, in missions\
around the world.\
25:54\
Then I turned to the senior couples.\
There were ten on the list.\
25:59\
Not very many. Surprised,\
26:02\
I asked my associate from the\
missionary department,\
26:05\
“How many do we need this week to fill\
the requests?” He responded, “300.”\
26:14\
That sobering moment has stayed with me.\
Ten couples to fill 300 requests.\
26:24\
President Nelson has encouraged\
couples to “get on their knees\
26:28\
and ask Heavenly Father if the time is\
right for them to serve a mission.”\
26:34\
Of all the qualifications, he said,\
26:37\
“a desire to serve may be\
the most important.”\
26:43\
As the scripture says, “If ye\
have desires to serve God,\
26:47\
ye are called to the work.” That work\
is all about the law of the harvest. We\
26:54\
read in John, “both he that soweth and\
he that reapeth may rejoice together.”\
27:03\
I have seen the law of the harvest\
fulfilled in my own family.\
27:08\
Some years ago I was visiting family\
when the bishop asked me to conclude\
27:14\
the sacrament service. As I was\
coming down from the stand,\
27:18\
a woman approached me with her seven\
children and introduced herself\
27:24\
as Sister Rebecca Guzman. She asked\
“Elder Rasband, Do you know Rulon\
27:32\
and Verda Rasband?” I beamed and\
replied, “They are my parents.”\
27:41\
You can see where this is going.\
27:44\
With Rebecca’s permission, who is here\
with family in the Conference Center,\
27:49\
I share her family's story.\
27:52\
My parents, Elder Rulon and Sister\
Verda Rasband were serving as\
27:59\
a senior couple in the Fort Lauderdale\
Florida Mission.\
28:03\
They were proselyting and\
by divine guidance,\
28:07\
knocked on the door of Rebecca's home.\
28:10\
She was just a teenager, and she\
loved listening to the music of\
28:14\
the Osmonds, in particular,\
28:17\
our friend Donny, who is\
here with us today.\
28:22\
She had listened to their\
media interviews\
28:25\
and learned they were members of\
28:27\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
28:30\
She felt there was something\
different about them\
28:33\
and thinking it might be their religion,\
28:36\
Rebecca spent two years researching\
the Church’s beliefs in\
28:41\
the school library. So when a kindly\
looking couple knocked\
28:46\
on her family's door and\
introduced themselves\
28:49\
as Latter-day Saint missionaries,\
she was taken aback.\
28:54\
“My mother told me to get rid of them,”\
Rebecca later wrote.\
28:58\
“But my heart said no. I looked into\
their faces and I felt so much warmth\
29:07\
and love. The memory still\
brings tears to my eyes\
29:12\
and deep emotion to my heart.”\
29:15\
Rebecca invited them in and my\
missionary parents shared\
29:18\
a message with her, her two younger\
sisters, and, despite her objections,\
29:24\
her mother. Rebecca described to me:\
“Both your parents were wonderful in\
29:31\
explaining any questions we had.\
29:34\
I can still see their faces, as if there\
was light surrounding them.\
29:39\
We always hugged your mother\
when she left,\
29:43\
and she always made a point of helping\
my mother feel comfortable\
29:48\
and respected. Your father always\
had a sparkle in his eyes\
29:52\
as he was teaching us\
about Jesus Christ.\
29:56\
He tried to include my father in\
discussions and eventually won him over.\
30:03\
My father was a chef at\
a local country club\
30:06\
and started cooking\
dinners for your parents,\
30:10\
including making your father’s\
favorite—Key Lime Pie.”\
30:16\
When Elder and Sister Rasband asked\
Rebecca and her family to read\
30:20\
the Book of Mormon, Rebecca\
did so in five days.\
30:24\
She wanted to be baptized immediately,\
30:27\
but the other members of her\
family were not ready.\
30:31\
After four months, Rebecca insisted she\
be baptized and join the true Church.\
30:38\
She recalled, “Every fiber of\
my soul knew it was true.\
30:45\
On April 5, 1979, missionaries\
baptized 19-year-old Rebecca,\
30:51\
her mother, and two sisters. My father\
was a witness at the baptism.\
30:59\
When I met Rebecca and\
her family at church,\
31:01\
we took a photograph of\
her family with me.\
31:05\
I took it home to my elderly mother,\
and she held it close to her heart.\
31:12\
Then she said to me. “Ronnie,\
31:17\
this is one of the happiest\
days of my life.”\
31:23\
My mother’s response begs the\
question for our seniors:\
31:29\
What are you doing at this\
stage of your life?\
31:33\
There are so many ways senior\
missionaries can do what no one else\
31:37\
can. You are a remarkable\
force for good,\
31:41\
seasoned in the Church and poised to\
encourage and rescue God’s children.\
31:47\
Some of you might be thinking,\
31:49\
“But what about leaving the\
grandchildren?\
31:53\
We would miss family milestones,\
birthdays, friends, and even our pets.”\
32:00\
If I had asked my mother why she\
and dad went on a mission,\
32:04\
I know she would have said this:\
“I have grandchildren.\
32:09\
I want them to know that your father\
and I served in the mission field.\
32:16\
We wanted to set an example for our\
posterity, and we were blessed,\
32:22\
so blessed.” As I have visited\
missions around the world,\
32:28\
I have seen the remarkable service of\
our legion of senior missionaries.\
32:33\
It is clear they are happy doing the\
will of the Lord and being about\
32:37\
the Lord’s business. For some—\
32:41\
and we hope thousands of you—full-time\
missionary service in another corner\
32:46\
of the world will be just the\
right place. For others,\
32:51\
serving a Church service mission\
at home might be preferable.\
32:56\
Because of health issues\
or other circumstances,\
32:59\
there are those who are unable to serve.\
33:03\
We understand those situations,\
33:05\
and it would be my hope you might find\
ways to support those who are serving.\
33:12\
Follow the Prophet's counsel\
and pray to know what\
33:15\
the Lord would have you do.\
33:18\
Mission fields around the world\
are pleading for your help.\
33:23\
President Nelson has said of\
our senior missionaries,\
33:26\
“They are young in spirit, wise\
and willing to work.”\
33:32\
Out in the field, you have a smorgasbord\
of opportunities:\
33:36\
you may serve in mission\
offices or temples,\
33:39\
strengthen young missionaries,\
bolster small branches,\
33:42\
work in family history centers or at\
historic sites, teach institute,\
33:48\
provide humanitarian service,\
work with young adults,\
33:53\
help in employment centers,\
or on Church farms.\
33:58\
The particulars of ways to serve,\
what best suits you,\
34:02\
where you are needed, and how you can\
get ready to go are addressed on\
34:07\
the website “Senior Missionary.”\
34:10\
You can also talk with your bishop\
or branch president.\
34:15\
I have called many couples\
to serve and watched as\
34:18\
the light of Christ has filled\
their countenances.\
34:21\
At their return, they have described\
growing closer to the Lord\
34:26\
and closer to one another,\
34:28\
feeling the Spirit of the\
Lord pour down upon them\
34:31\
and knowing they are making a\
difference. Who would not want that?\
34:37\
A mission might be the greatest\
chapter in a couple's life.\
34:41\
A good title might be “My Lord\
Will Have Need of Me.”\
34:46\
You may be on unfamiliar ground.\
34:49\
However, the power of the Spirit will\
make you feel right at home.\
34:54\
My parents and tens of thousands of\
returned missionary couples have borne\
34:59\
testimony of the joy they found\
in missionary work.\
35:03\
The Lord has said in latter-day\
scripture: “And if it so be\
35:08\
that ye labor all your days in crying\
repentance unto this people,\
35:12\
and bring save it be one soul unto me,\
35:15\
how great shall be your joy with him\
in the kingdom of my Father!”\
35:21\
Isaiah gave us a poetic description\
of what it means to serve in\
35:25\
the mission “field.” Scripture tells\
us, “the field is the world.”\
35:31\
The great ancient prophet wrote:\
“For ye shall go out with joy,\
35:36\
and be led forth with peace:\
35:38\
the mountains and the hills shall break\
forth before you into singing,\
35:43\
and all the trees of the field\
shall clap their hands.”\
35:47\
The mountains, hills, fields, and trees\
can be likened to mission presidents,\
35:53\
bishops, district leaders, members,\
and those who seek the truth\
35:57\
but they “know not where to\
find it” will testify that\
36:01\
the senior missionaries change\
36:03\
the very landscape with their testimony\
of our Savior and Redeemer,\
36:09\
Jesus Christ.\
36:12\
As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ,\
36:15\
I ask you to serve as a missionary\
in the gathering of Israel\
36:20\
and perhaps even serve again.\
We need you—we need you.\
36:29\
We are grateful to you seniors,\
36:31\
for the lives you have led and\
36:33\
the examples you have been in your\
homes, wards, and stakes.\
36:37\
I now invite you to take your know-how\
coupled with your time-honored\
36:41\
testimonies and go on a mission.\
36:44\
I pray that the next time I sit\
down to assign senior couples,\
36:48\
there will be hundreds of you waiting\
anxiously for your call.\
36:54\
I also promise that as you serve,\
36:57\
you will feel the love of the Lord\
in your life. You will know Him,\
37:02\
He will know you, and “how\
great shall be your joy.”\
37:08\
Your dedicated service to Jesus Christ\
will inspire and bless your family,\
37:15\
your grandchildren, and\
great grandchildren.\
37:19\
Peace and love will be multiplied in\
their lives for years to come.\
37:27\
I promise. In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
37:32\
Amen.\
