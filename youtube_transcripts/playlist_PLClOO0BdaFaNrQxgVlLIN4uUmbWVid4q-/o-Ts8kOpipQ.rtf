Members of the Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints are frequently\
0:07\
asked, How is your church different\
from other Christian churches?\
0:14\
Among the answers we give\
are the fullness of\
0:17\
the doctrine of Jesus Christ.\
0:21\
Foremost among that doctrine is\
0:24\
the fact that our Heavenly Father\
loves all His children\
0:28\
so much that He wants us all to live\
in a kingdom of glory forever.\
0:36\
Moreover, He wants us to live with Him\
and His Son, Jesus Christ, eternally.\
0:43\
His plan gives us the teachings\
and the opportunity to make\
0:48\
the choices that will assure us the\
destiny and the life we choose.\
0:55\
From modern revelation, we know that the\
ultimate destiny of all who live\
1:01\
on the earth is not the inadequate idea\
of heaven for the righteous and\
1:08\
the eternal sufferings\
of hell for the rest.\
1:12\
God’s loving plan for His children\
includes this reality taught by our\
1:19\
Savior, Jesus Christ: “In my father’s\
house are many mansions.”\
1:28\
The revealed doctrine of the restored\
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
1:32\
Saints teaches that all\
the children of God,\
1:36\
with exceptions too limited\
to consider here,\
1:40\
will ultimately inherit one of\
three kingdoms of glory,\
1:47\
even the least of which surpasses\
all understanding.\
1:54\
After a period in which the disobedient\
suffer for their sins,\
1:59\
which suffering prepares them\
for what is to follow,\
2:04\
all will be resurrected and proceed\
to the final judgment of\
2:09\
the Lord Jesus Christ. There, our\
loving Savior, who we are taught\
2:16\
glorifies the Father and saves\
all the works of His hands,\
2:22\
will send all the children of God to\
one of these kingdoms of glory,\
2:28\
according to the desires manifested\
through their choices.\
2:34\
Another unique doctrine and practice\
of the restored Church is\
2:38\
the revealed commandments and\
covenants that offer all\
2:42\
the children of God the sacred\
privilege of qualifying for\
2:47\
the highest degree of glory\
in the celestial kingdom.\
2:52\
That highest destination—exaltation\
in the celestial kingdom—is\
2:59\
the focus of the Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
3:06\
From modern revelation, Latter-day\
Saints have this unique understanding\
3:11\
of God’s plan of happiness\
for His children.\
3:15\
That plan begins with our life as\
spirits before we were born,\
3:20\
and it reveals the purpose\
3:23\
and conditions of our chosen\
journey in mortality\
3:28\
and our desired destination thereafter.\
3:33\
We know from modern revelation that all\
kingdoms have a law given and that\
3:39\
the kingdom of glory we receive in the\
final judgment is determined by\
3:45\
the laws we choose to follow in our\
mortal journey. Under that loving plan,\
3:52\
there are multiple kingdoms.\
3:55\
Many mansions, so that all of\
God’s children will inherit\
4:00\
a kingdom of glory whose laws\
they can comfortably abide.\
4:07\
As we describe the nature and\
requirements of each of\
4:11\
the three kingdoms in the Father’s plan,\
4:15\
we begin with the highest,\
4:17\
which is the focus of the divine\
commandments and ordinances God has\
4:23\
revealed through the Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
4:29\
In the celestial glory, there\
are three levels, of which\
4:34\
the highest is exaltation in\
the celestial kingdom.\
4:40\
This is the dwelling of those who\
“have received of His fullness\
4:45\
and of His glory. Wherefore\
they are gods,\
4:50\
even the sons and daughters of God,\
4:53\
and dwell in the presence of God and\
His Christ forever and ever.”\
4:58\
End of quote.\
5:02\
Through revelation, God has\
revealed the eternal laws,\
5:06\
ordinances, and covenants that\
must be observed to develop\
5:11\
the godly attributes necessary to\
realize this divine potential.\
5:19\
The Church of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints focuses on these\
5:24\
because the purpose of this restored\
Church is to prepare God’s children\
5:30\
for salvation in the celestial\
glory and more particularly,\
5:36\
for exaltation in its highest degree.\
5:43\
God’s plan, founded on eternal truth,\
5:47\
requires that exaltation can be attained\
only through faithfulness to\
5:53\
the covenants of an eternal marriage\
between a man and a woman in\
5:58\
the holy temple, which marriage will\
ultimately be available to all\
6:04\
the faithful. That is why\
we teach that, quote,\
6:09\
Gender is an essential characteristic\
of individual, premortal,\
6:15\
mortal, and eternal identity\
and purpose.\
6:21\
A uniquely valuable teaching to help\
us prepare for exaltation is\
6:26\
the 1995 proclamation on the family.\
6:31\
Its declarations clarify the\
requirements that prepare us to\
6:35\
live with God the Father and\
His Son Jesus Christ.\
6:40\
Those who do not fully understand\
the Father’s loving plan\
6:44\
for His children may consider this\
family proclamation no more than\
6:49\
a changeable statement of policy.\
6:53\
In contrast, we affirm that\
the Family Proclamation,\
6:58\
founded on irrevocable doctrine, defines\
the mortal family relationship,\
7:05\
where the most important part of our\
eternal development can occur.\
7:12\
The apostle Paul describes the\
three degrees of glory,\
7:16\
likening them to the glories\
of the sun, moon, and stars.\
7:23\
He names the highest celestial\
and the second terrestrial.\
7:29\
He does not name the lowest,\
7:32\
but a revelation to Joseph Smith\
added its name, telestial.\
7:39\
That revelation also describes\
the nature of\
7:42\
the persons to be assigned to each\
of these kingdoms of glory.\
7:49\
Those who do not choose, quote,\
7:52\
to abide the law of a celestial kingdom\
will inherit another kingdom of glory,\
8:00\
lesser than the celestial,\
8:02\
but suited to the laws they have chosen\
and can comfortably abide.\
8:10\
That word “abide,” so common in the\
scriptures, means “a secure placement.”\
8:18\
For example, those in the\
terrestrial kingdom,\
8:23\
comparable to the popular\
concept of heaven,\
8:27\
are they who receive of the\
presence of the Son,\
8:32\
but not of the fulness of the Father.\
8:36\
They were, quote, honorable men of\
the earth who were blinded by\
8:40\
the craftiness of men, but not valiant\
in the testimony of Jesus.\
8:49\
End of quote. The revealing description\
of those assigned to the lowest of\
8:55\
the kingdoms of glory, the telestial\
is, quote, he who cannot abide\
9:03\
a terrestrial glory. Unquote.\
9:07\
That describes those who\
reject the Savior\
9:11\
and have observed no divine\
limits on their behavior.\
9:17\
This is the kingdom where the wicked\
abide after they have suffered\
9:22\
for their sins. These are described\
in modern revelation as, quote,\
9:29\
they who received not the gospel of\
Christ, neither the testimony of Jesus.\
9:36\
These are they who are liars and\
sorcerers and adulterers\
9:40\
and whoremongers and whosoever loves\
and makes a lie. End of quote.\
9:48\
Speaking of the three kingdoms of\
glory with his prophetic vision,\
9:53\
President Russell M. Nelson\
recently wrote, quote,\
9:57\
Mortal lifetime is barely a nanosecond\
compared with eternity.\
10:04\
But what a crucial nanosecond it is.\
Consider carefully how it works.\
10:11\
During this mortal life, you get to\
choose which laws you are willing to\
10:16\
obey, those of the celestial kingdom or\
the terrestrial or the telestial,\
10:23\
and therefore, in which kingdom of\
glory you will live forever.\
10:29\
What a plan. It is a plan that\
completely honors your agency.\
10:36\
End of quote.\
10:39\
The apostle Paul taught that\
the Lord's teachings\
10:42\
and commandments were given\
10:44\
that we may all attain, quote,\
10:47\
the measure of the stature of\
the fulness of Christ.\
10:52\
That process requires far more\
than acquiring knowledge.\
10:57\
It is not even enough to be\
convinced of the gospel.\
11:01\
We must act so that we\
are converted by it.\
11:06\
In contrast to other preaching, which\
teaches us to know something,\
11:12\
the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges\
us to become something.\
11:19\
From such teachings, we conclude that\
the final judgment is not just\
11:25\
an evaluation of a sum total of good\
and evil acts—what we have done—\
11:33\
it is based on the final effect of our\
acts and thoughts—what we have become.\
11:41\
We qualify for eternal life through a\
process of conversion. As used here,\
11:50\
this word of many meanings signifies\
a profound change of nature.\
11:56\
It is not enough for anyone just\
to go through the motions.\
12:01\
The commandments, ordinances, and\
covenants of the gospel are not\
12:05\
a list of deposits required to be\
made in some heavenly account.\
12:11\
The gospel of Jesus Christ is\
12:13\
a plan that shows us how to become what\
our Heavenly Father desires us to\
12:19\
become. Because of Jesus Christ\
and His atonement,\
12:25\
when we fall short in this life,\
12:27\
we can repent and rejoin the covenant\
path that leads to what our\
12:32\
Heavenly Father desires for us.\
12:36\
The Book of Mormon teaches that\
this life is the time\
12:41\
for us to prepare to meet God. But that\
challenging limitation to this life\
12:49\
was given a hopeful context, at least\
to some extent for some persons,\
12:56\
by what the Lord revealed to\
President Joseph F. Smith,\
13:00\
now recorded in the Doctrine\
and Covenants section 138.\
13:05\
I beheld, the prophet wrote,\
13:09\
that the faithful elders\
of this dispensation,\
13:12\
when they depart from mortal life,\
13:15\
continue their labors in the preaching\
of the gospel of repentance\
13:20\
and redemption through the sacrifice of\
13:23\
the only begotten Son of God among\
those who are in darkness and under\
13:30\
the bondage of sin in the great world\
of the spirits of the dead.\
13:36\
The dead who repent will be redeemed\
through obedience to the ordinances of\
13:44\
the house of God. And\
after they have paid\
13:48\
the penalty of their transgressions\
and are washed clean shall receive\
13:54\
a reward according to their works,\
13:56\
for they are heirs of salvation.\
End of quote.\
14:03\
In addition, we know that\
the millennium,\
14:06\
the thousand years that follow the\
Second Coming of the Savior will be\
14:11\
a time to perform the\
required ordinances\
14:14\
for those who have not received\
them in their mortal lives.\
14:20\
There is much we do not know about\
the three major periods in\
14:26\
the plan of salvation and their\
relationship to one another.\
14:31\
One, the mortal spirit world, two,\
mortality, and three, the next life.\
14:39\
But we do know these eternal truths:\
14:43\
Salvation is an individual matter, but\
exaltation is a family matter.\
14:52\
We have a loving Heavenly Father who\
will see that we receive every blessing\
14:57\
and every advantage that our own\
desires and choices allow.\
15:04\
We also know that He will\
force no one into\
15:08\
a sealing relationship against\
his or her will.\
15:13\
The blessings of a sealed\
relationship are assured\
15:18\
for all who keep their covenants,\
15:21\
but never by forcing a\
sealed relationship\
15:26\
on another person who is\
unworthy or unwilling.\
15:32\
My dear brothers and sisters, I testify\
of the truth of these things.\
15:39\
I testify of our Lord Jesus Christ, the\
author and finisher of our faith.\
15:46\
Whose Atonement under the plan of our\
Father in Heaven makes it all possible.\
15:53\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
