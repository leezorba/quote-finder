I earnestly pray for the help of the\
Holy Ghost as I now express my love,\
0:07\
admiration, and gratitude\
for the members of\
0:10\
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints all around the world.\
0:17\
The year 1947 marked the\
100th anniversary of\
0:22\
the first Latter-day Saint pioneers\
arriving in the Salt Lake Valley.\
0:27\
Many memorable celebrations were\
held during that year,\
0:31\
and countless expressions of\
gratitude were offered for\
0:34\
the devoted disciples of Jesus Christ,\
who blazed trails, built homes,\
0:41\
planted crops in the barren desert,\
and settled communities.\
0:47\
President J. Rubin Clark, First\
Counselor in the First Presidency,\
0:51\
gave one of the most memorable\
0:53\
and touching tributes to these\
faithful pioneers in\
0:57\
the October 1947 General Conference.\
1:02\
In his message, President Clark\
briefly acknowledged\
1:05\
the well-known leaders who guided\
the westward migration,\
1:10\
such as Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball,\
Wilford Woodruff, Parley\
1:14\
P. Pratt and many others.\
However,\
1:18\
his primary purpose was not to recount\
1:20\
the accomplishments of these\
noteworthy individuals.\
1:25\
Rather, he focused his remarks on the\
stalwart souls whose names are\
1:31\
neither known nor officially\
recorded in Church history.\
1:35\
The instructive title of his message is:\
“They of the Last Wagon.”\
1:43\
President Clark described in great\
detail the characteristics of and\
1:47\
the challenges faced by the\
migrants who traveled in\
1:50\
the last covered wagon in each of\
the long wagon trains that crossed\
1:56\
the plains. He praised these anonymous\
1:59\
and uncelebrated heroes\
who, day after day,\
2:04\
week after week, and month after month,\
choked on the dust\
2:09\
stirred up by all of the wagons\
rolling in front of them,\
2:13\
and who overcame the relentless\
obstacles they encountered along\
2:17\
the way. President Clark declared,\
They of the last wagon\
2:25\
pressed forward, worn and\
tired, footsore,\
2:29\
sometimes almost disheartened,\
2:32\
borne up by their faith\
that God loved them.\
2:35\
That the restored gospel was true and\
that the Lord led and directed\
2:40\
the Brethren out in front.\
2:43\
He concluded his message with\
this stirring commendation:\
2:49\
To these humble souls, great\
in faith, great in work,\
2:54\
great in righteous living, great in\
fashioning our priceless heritage—\
2:59\
I humbly render my love, my respect,\
my reverent homage.\
3:06\
In 1990, President Howard W. Hunter,\
3:09\
then President of the Quorum\
of the Twelve Apostles,\
3:13\
delivered a message about\
3:14\
the indispensable contributions of\
countless Church members who served\
3:19\
diligently and faithfully\
and who receive little\
3:23\
or no public acknowledgment or acclaim.\
President Hunter explained,\
3:31\
It was said about the young and\
valiant Captain Moroni,\
3:35\
“If all men had been and were and ever\
would be like unto Moroni, behold,\
3:42\
the very powers of hell would\
have been shaken forever.\
3:45\
Yea, the devil would never have power\
over the hearts of the children of men.”\
3:52\
What a compliment to a famous\
and powerful man.\
3:55\
Two verses later is a statement about\
Helaman and his brethren who played\
4:01\
a less conspicuous role than\
Moroni that reads,\
4:06\
“Now behold, Helaman and his brethren\
were no less serviceable unto\
4:11\
the people than was Moroni.” President\
Hunter continued,\
4:17\
In other words, even though Helaman was\
not as noticeable or conspicuous\
4:22\
as Moroni, he was as serviceable.\
4:26\
That is, he was as helpful\
or useful as Moroni.\
4:33\
President Hunter then counseled all of\
us to be no less serviceable. He said,\
4:39\
If you feel that much of what\
you do this year or in\
4:43\
the years to come does not make\
you very famous, take heart.\
4:47\
Most of the best people who ever lived\
weren't very famous either.\
4:52\
Serve and grow faithfully and quietly.\
4:59\
I am grateful for millions of Church\
members who today are coming unto\
5:06\
the Savior and pressing forward\
on the covenant path in\
5:11\
the last wagons of our contemporary\
wagon trains\
5:15\
and who truly are no less serviceable.\
5:19\
Your strong faith in\
Heavenly Father and\
5:23\
the Lord Jesus Christ and your\
unpretentious, consecrated lives\
5:29\
inspire me to be a better man and\
disciple. I love you. I admire\
5:37\
you.\
5:39\
I thank you. And I commend you.\
5:45\
A statement in the Book of Mormon\
by Samuel the Lamanite\
5:48\
best summarizes my feelings for you:\
5:53\
“Behold that the more part of them\
are in the path of their duty\
5:57\
and they do walk circumspectly\
before God\
6:02\
and they do observe to keep his\
commandments and his statutes.\
6:07\
Yea, I say unto you that the more\
part of them are doing this\
6:12\
and they are striving with\
unwearied diligence,\
6:16\
that they may bring the remainder of\
their brethren to the knowledge of\
6:19\
the truth.” I believe the phrase “in\
6:24\
the path of their duty” describes\
discerning brothers\
6:27\
and sisters who look for and sit next\
to people who are alone in Church\
6:33\
meetings and in a variety\
of other settings.\
6:36\
They consistently strive to comfort\
those that stand in need of comfort\
6:41\
without expectations of acknowledgment\
or praise.\
6:46\
The phrase “in the path of their\
duty” describes spouses\
6:50\
and children who support a companion,\
6:53\
parent, or child who serves in\
a leadership position in\
6:57\
the Lord's restored Church.\
7:00\
Their steady, quiet, and typically\
unrecognized sustaining influence makes\
7:07\
possible the blessing\
of many individuals\
7:10\
and families in ways that will be\
fully known only in eternity.\
7:17\
The phrase “in the path of their duty”\
describes individuals who,\
7:23\
having turned away from God humbly,\
are returning to him once again,\
7:29\
repenting of their sins and seeking\
the cleansing and healing power of\
7:34\
the Savior’s Atonement. Coming\
unto Christ by returning to\
7:39\
the covenant path from sinful detours\
into forbidden paths is spiritually\
7:46\
essential and righteously rigorous.\
7:50\
As they press forward with faith\
and weary not in well-doing,\
7:55\
They are laying the foundation of\
7:57\
a great work in their individual lives\
to all generations and for eternity.\
8:05\
The phrase “in the path of their duty”\
describes righteous individuals who\
8:09\
yearn to become yoked to the Savior\
through the authorized covenants\
8:14\
and ordinances of His gospel,\
8:18\
but may be prohibited from doing so\
by factors beyond their control.\
8:23\
I promise your personal anguish will\
be relieved and your obedience\
8:30\
and faithfulness to patiently submit\
your will to God will be rewarded in\
8:36\
the own due time of the Lord.\
8:40\
Weeping may endure for a night,\
but joy cometh in the morning.\
8:48\
The phrase “in the path of their duty”\
describes the inspired translators\
8:52\
and interpreters around the world who\
serve the Lord by helping friends\
8:56\
and members to hear the fullness of\
the gospel in their own tongue\
9:00\
and in their own language.\
9:03\
Their voices, signed language,\
9:05\
and translated documents\
convey eternal truths.\
9:10\
Yet few of us know their names or ever\
express appreciation through\
9:16\
the gift of tongues with which\
they have been blessed.\
9:18\
Translators and interpreters\
serve diligently,\
9:22\
selflessly and most often anonymously,\
9:26\
to help people receive the spiritual\
gift of faith through reading\
9:31\
and hearing the word of God.\
9:34\
The phrase “in the path of their duty”\
describes faithful married men\
9:40\
and women who honor their covenant\
responsibility to multiply\
9:45\
and replenish the earth and who also\
are blessed with the strength\
9:50\
and stamina to wrestle with their\
children in sacrament meetings.\
9:55\
In an increasingly confused world\
beset with calamities\
10:00\
and misplaced priorities,\
10:03\
these courageous souls heed not\
10:05\
the secular voices extolling\
self-centredness.\
10:10\
They reverence the sanctity\
10:12\
and importance of life in Heavenly\
Father's plan of happiness\
10:16\
for His children.\
10:20\
Many married couples also trust in God.\
10:26\
When the righteous desires of their\
hearts are not realized,\
10:30\
how or when they had hoped and dreamed,\
10:34\
they wait upon the Lord and do not\
demand that He meet their mortal\
10:39\
deadlines. For since the\
beginning of the world,\
10:44\
have not men heard nor\
perceived by the ear,\
10:48\
neither hath any eye seen,\
O God, besides Thee,\
10:52\
How great things Thou hast prepared\
For them that waiteth for Thee.\
11:02\
The phrase “in the path of their\
duty” describes the thousands\
11:07\
and thousands of nursery leaders\
and primary teachers who love\
11:12\
and instruct the children of the\
Church each Sabbath day.\
11:16\
Consider the eternal impact of\
11:19\
the service rendered by these\
devoted disciples and\
11:23\
the marvelous blessings promised to\
those who minister to children.\
11:28\
And Jesus took a child and set\
him in the midst of them.\
11:32\
And when He had taken him in His arms,\
He said unto them,\
11:37\
Whosoever shall receive one of such\
children in my name receiveth me.\
11:44\
And whosoever shall receive me receiveth\
not me, but Him that sent me.\
11:51\
The phrase “in the path of their duty”\
describes dedicated children tenderly\
11:56\
caring for aged parents, a\
sleep-deprived mother comforting\
12:01\
a frightened child while standing guard\
as a lioness at the gate of her home.\
12:08\
Church members who arrive early\
and stay late to set up\
12:11\
and take down chairs and inspired\
individuals who invite family,\
12:16\
friends and associates to come and see,\
come and help, and come and stay.\
12:23\
I have described only a few selected\
examples of covenant-keeping\
12:28\
and devoted disciples of Jesus Christ\
12:30\
like you who are pressing forward\
in the path of your duty.\
12:35\
Millions of additional examples of\
Latter-day Saints who offer their whole\
12:40\
souls unto God are found in\
Christ-centered homes\
12:44\
and in Church units around the world.\
You love and serve.\
12:50\
You listen and learn, care and console,\
and teach and testify by\
12:57\
the power of the Holy Ghost.\
12:59\
You fast and pray often, wax stronger\
and stronger in humility,\
13:04\
and grow firmer and firmer in\
the faith of Christ unto\
13:08\
the filling your souls with\
joy and consolation.\
13:12\
Yea even to the purifying and the\
sanctification of your hearts,\
13:17\
which sanctification cometh because\
of yielding your hearts unto God.\
13:25\
They of the last wagon, all who\
are no less serviceable.\
13:31\
And you, who today are pressing forward\
in the path of your duty, are\
13:37\
the strength of the Savior's\
restored Church.\
13:42\
And as the Lord has promised,\
all thrones and dominions,\
13:47\
principalities and powers\
shall be revealed\
13:50\
and set forth upon all who have\
endured valiantly for\
13:56\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
13:59\
I joyfully witness that Heavenly Father\
and His beloved Son live,\
14:05\
and Their promises are sure.\
In the sacred name of\
14:11\
the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
