Our Primary children sing,\
“Love is spoken here.”\
0:08\
I once gave Sister Gong a small locket.\
I had it inscribed:\
0:13\
Dot, dot; dot, dot; dot, dot, dash.\
0:18\
Those familiar with Morse code will\
recognize the letters “I-I-U.”\
0:24\
But I included a second code. In\
Mandarin Chinese “Ai” means love.\
0:31\
So double decoded, the message was\
“I love you.” Susan, Sweetheart, I\
0:40\
“ai” you.\
0:44\
We speak love in many languages. I am\
told the human family speaks 7,168\
0:51\
living languages. In the Church we speak\
575 documented primary languages with\
0:58\
many dialects. We also\
communicate intent,\
1:02\
inflection, and emotion through art,\
music, dance, logical symbols,\
1:07\
inter- and intra-personal expression.\
Today,\
1:12\
let us speak of three languages\
of gospel love:\
1:17\
the language of warmth and reverence,\
the language of service and sacrifice,\
1:23\
and the language of covenant belonging.\
1:26\
First, the language of warmth\
and reverence. With warmth\
1:30\
and reverence, Sister Gong\
asked children and youth,\
1:34\
“How do you know your parents\
and families love you?”\
1:38\
In Guatemala, children say, “My parents\
work hard to feed our family.”\
1:45\
In North America, children say,\
1:47\
“My parents read stories and\
tuck me into bed at night.”\
1:51\
In the Holy Land, children say,\
“My parents keep me safe.”\
1:56\
In Ghana, West Africa, children say,\
1:59\
“My parents help me with my\
children and youth goals.”\
2:03\
One child said, “Even though she’s very\
tired after working all day,\
2:10\
my mother comes outside\
to play with me.”\
2:14\
Her mother cried when she heard her\
daily sacrifices matter.\
2:19\
A young woman said, “Even though my\
mother and I sometimes disagree,\
2:24\
I trust my mother.”\
Her mother cried too.\
2:29\
Sometimes we need to know love spoken\
here is heard and appreciated here.\
2:37\
With warmth and reverence,\
2:38\
our sacrament and other meetings\
focus on Jesus Christ.\
2:42\
We speak reverently of the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ—personal and real,\
2:49\
not only of atonement in\
2:51\
the abstract. We call Jesus Christ’s\
Restored Church in His name,\
2:56\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
3:00\
We use reverent prayer language when we\
address Heavenly Father, and warm\
3:05\
respect when we speak with each other.\
As we recognize Jesus Christ at\
3:10\
the heart of temple covenants,\
3:12\
we refer less to going to the temple and\
more to coming to Jesus Christ in\
3:18\
the house of the Lord. Each covenant\
whispers, “Love is spoken here.”\
3:25\
New members say Church vocabulary\
often requires decoding.\
3:31\
We chuckle at the thought that\
“stake house” could mean\
3:35\
a nice beef dinner. “Ward building”\
could indicate a hospital.\
3:42\
“Opening exercises” could invite us\
to do “head, shoulders,\
3:44\
knees, and toes” in the\
church parking lot.\
3:48\
But please let us be understanding\
and kind\
3:54\
as we learn new languages\
of love together.\
3:58\
New at church, a convert was told\
her skirts were too short.\
4:03\
Instead of taking offense, she replied,\
in effect, “My heart is converted.\
4:08\
Please be patient as my\
skirts catch up.”\
4:14\
The words we use can draw us closer or\
distance us from other Christians\
4:20\
and friends. Sometimes we speak\
of missionary work,\
4:24\
temple work, humanitarian\
4:27\
and welfare work in ways that\
may cause others to think\
4:30\
we believe we work on our own.\
4:33\
Let us always speak with warm\
and reverent gratitude\
4:36\
for God’s work and glory and the mercy,\
4:39\
merits, and grace of Jesus Christ\
and His atoning sacrifice.\
4:45\
Second, the gospel language\
of service and sacrifice.\
4:49\
As we gather again at church each\
week to honor and rejoice in\
4:54\
the sabbath day, we can express our\
sacramental covenant commitment to\
4:58\
Jesus Christ and each other through\
our church callings, fellowship,\
5:03\
sociality, and service. When I asked\
local Church leaders what concerns them,\
5:09\
both brothers and sisters say some of\
our members are not accepting church\
5:14\
calls. Calls to serve the Lord\
5:17\
and each other in His Church give\
opportunity to increase in compassion,\
5:22\
capacity, and humility.\
As we’re set apart,\
5:26\
we can receive the Lord's inspiration\
to lift and strengthen others\
5:30\
and ourselves. Of course,\
5:33\
the changing circumstances\
5:35\
and seasons of our lives may affect\
our ability to serve,\
5:39\
but hopefully never our desire.\
5:42\
With King Benjamin, we say, if I had,\
I would give, and offer all we can.\
5:51\
Stake and ward leaders, let’s do our\
part. As we call (and release) brothers\
5:57\
and sisters to serve in\
the Lord’s Church,\
5:59\
let’s please do so with dignity\
and inspiration.\
6:03\
Help each feel appreciated and\
that they can be successful.\
6:07\
Please counsel with and listen to\
sister leaders. May we remember,\
6:12\
as President J. Reuben Clark taught in\
6:15\
the Lord’s Church, we serve where called\
“which place one neither seeks\
6:19\
nor declines.” When Sister\
Gong and I were married,\
6:24\
Elder David B. Haight counseled, “Always\
hold a calling in the Church,\
6:29\
especially when life is busy.”\
He said,\
6:31\
“You need to feel the Lord’s love\
for those you serve and for you\
6:36\
as you serve.” I promise that love is\
spoken here, there, and everywhere\
6:44\
as we answer yes to Church leaders\
to serve the Lord in His Church,\
6:49\
by His Spirit and our covenants.\
6:54\
The Lord’s restored Church can be an\
incubator for a Zion community.\
6:58\
As we worship, serve, enjoy,\
and learn His love\
7:04\
together, we anchor each\
other in His gospel.\
7:08\
We may disagree politically\
or on social issues,\
7:12\
but find harmony as we sing together\
in the ward choir.\
7:17\
We nurture connection\
and fight isolation\
7:21\
as we regularly minister with our\
hearts in each other's homes\
7:26\
and neighborhoods. Doing member\
visits with stake presidents,\
7:31\
I feel their deep love for members\
in every circumstance.\
7:37\
As we drove past member\
homes in his stake,\
7:40\
one stake president noted that whether\
we live in a home with\
7:44\
a swimming pool or a home\
with a dirt floor,\
7:47\
Church service is a privilege that\
often includes sacrifice.\
7:52\
Yet he wisely noticed when we serve\
and sacrifice in the gospel,\
7:57\
together we find fewer faults and\
greater peace. When we let Him,\
8:04\
Jesus Christ helps us\
speak His love here.\
8:09\
This summer, our family met\
wonderful Church members\
8:12\
and friends in Loughborough\
and Oxford, England.\
8:16\
These meaningful gatherings reminded\
me how ward social\
8:20\
and service activities can build\
new and enduring gospel bonds.\
8:26\
For some time I have felt that\
in many places in the Church,\
8:31\
a few more ward activities—of course,\
8:34\
planned and implemented with gospel\
purpose—could knit us together with\
8:40\
even greater belonging and unity.\
8:43\
One inspired ward activities\
8:45\
chair and committee nurtures individuals\
and a community of saints.\
8:50\
Their well-planned activities\
help everybody feel valued,\
8:53\
included, and invited to\
play a needed role.\
8:58\
Such activities bridge ages and\
backgrounds, create lasting memories,\
9:03\
and can be carried out with\
little or no cost.\
9:07\
Enjoyable gospel activities also\
invite neighbors and friends.\
9:12\
Sociality and service often go together.\
9:16\
Young adults know if you really\
want to get to know someone,\
9:20\
then paint side by side on a ladder\
in a service project.\
9:27\
Of course, no individual and no family\
is perfect. We all need help\
9:31\
better to speak love here. “Perfect\
love casteth out fear.”\
9:37\
Faith service and sacrifice draw us\
beyond ourselves, closer to our Savior.\
9:44\
The more compassionate, faithful,\
and selfless our service\
9:48\
and sacrifice are in Him,\
9:51\
the more we may begin to fathom Jesus\
Christ’s atoning compassion and grace\
9:57\
for us. And that brings\
us to the language,\
10:01\
the gospel language of\
covenant belonging.\
10:05\
We live in a self-centered world.\
So much is “I choose me.” It\
10:10\
is as if we believe we know best our own\
self interest and how to pursue it.\
10:16\
But ultimately, it's not true.\
10:19\
Jesus Christ personifies this powerful,\
ageless truth:\
10:25\
“For whosoever will save his life,\
shall lose it;\
10:29\
and whosoever will lose his life,\
for my sake, shall find it.\
10:34\
For what is a man [or a woman] profited\
10:36\
if he shall gain the whole world,\
and lose his own soul?”\
10:42\
Jesus Christ offers a better way.\
10:44\
Relationships founded\
on divine covenant,\
10:48\
stronger than the cords of death.\
10:52\
Covenant belonging with God\
and each other can heal\
10:56\
and sanctify our most cherished\
relationships. In truth,\
11:01\
He knows us better and loves us more\
than we know or love ourselves.\
11:07\
In truth, when we covenant all we are,\
we can become more than we are.\
11:14\
God’s power and wisdom can bless us\
with every good gift in His time\
11:19\
and way. Generative Artificial\
Intelligence (AI)\
11:25\
has made great strides\
in language translation.\
11:31\
Long gone are the days when\
a computer might translate\
11:34\
the idiomatic phrase “The\
spirit is willing,\
11:38\
but the flesh is weak” as “The wine is\
good, but the meat is spoiled.”\
11:46\
Interestingly repeating extensive\
examples of a language teaches\
11:52\
a computer a language more effectively\
than does teaching a computer\
11:57\
the rules of grammar. Similarly,\
our own direct,\
12:01\
repeated experiences may be our\
best spiritual way to learn\
12:07\
the gospel languages of\
warmth and reverence,\
12:10\
service, and sacrifice and\
covenant belonging.\
12:15\
So where and how does Jesus Christ\
speak to you in love?\
12:21\
Where and how do you hear\
His love spoken here?\
12:25\
May we each learn to speak and hear His\
voice here in our hearts and homes\
12:30\
and in our gospel callings, activities,\
ministering, and service. In God’s plan,\
12:37\
we will each transition one day from\
this life into the next life.\
12:42\
When we meet the Lord, I imagine Him\
saying with words of instruction\
12:47\
and promise, “My love is spoken here.”\
In the sacred name of Jesus Christ,\
12:56\
amen.\
