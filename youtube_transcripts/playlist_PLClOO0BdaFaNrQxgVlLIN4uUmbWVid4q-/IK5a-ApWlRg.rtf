From 1856 to 1860, thousands of Latter-\
day Saint pioneers pulled their\
0:07\
belongings in handcarts for over\
1,000 miles as they traveled to\
0:11\
the Salt Lake Valley. 167 years ago this\
very week, on October 4, 1856,\
0:19\
President Brigham Young was surprised\
to learn that two handcart companies,\
0:23\
led by Edward Martin and James Willie,\
0:26\
were still hundreds of\
miles from Salt Lake\
0:28\
with winter fast approaching.\
The very next day,\
0:33\
not far from where we meet today,\
0:35\
President Young stood before the Saints\
0:37\
and declared, “Many of our brethren\
and sisters are on\
0:40\
the plains with handcarts, and\
they must be brought here ...\
0:44\
go and bring in those people\
now on the plains.”\
0:49\
Just two days later, the first rescue\
parties departed in search of\
0:52\
the handcart pioneers. A member of\
the Willie company described\
0:57\
the desperate situation prior to the\
arrival of the main rescue team.\
1:02\
He shared, “Just when it seemed\
all would be lost\
1:05\
and there seemed little\
left to live for, ...\
1:07\
like a thunderbolt out of the clear sky,\
God answered our prayers.\
1:12\
A rescue party bringing food and\
supplies came into sight. ... How\
1:17\
we thanked God for our rescue.”\
1:21\
These rescuers were heroes\
to the pioneers,\
1:24\
putting their own lives at risk in\
extreme weather conditions to bring\
1:27\
as many as possible safely home.\
1:30\
One such hero was Ephraim Hanks.\
In mid-October, and unaware of\
1:36\
the handcart predicament,\
1:37\
Hanks was returning to his home in Salt\
Lake following a trip when, during\
1:42\
the night, he was awakened by a voice, a\
voice that said to him, “The handcart\
1:47\
people are in trouble and you are\
wanted. Will you go and help them?”\
1:53\
With that question ringing in his mind,\
he hurried back to Salt Lake City,\
1:57\
and upon hearing President Heber C.\
Kimball call for additional volunteers,\
2:02\
Hanks set out the very next day\
on his own to the rescue.\
2:06\
Moving quickly, he overtook\
other rescuers enroute,\
2:10\
and upon reaching the Martin company,\
2:12\
Hanks recalled, “The sight\
that met my gaze as\
2:16\
I entered their camp can never\
be erased from my memory ...\
2:19\
and was enough to touch\
the stoutest heart.”\
2:24\
Ephraim Hanks spent days moving from\
tent to tent blessing the sick.\
2:28\
He related that, “In scores of instances\
when we had ministered to the sick\
2:33\
and rebuked the diseases in the\
name of the Lord Jesus Christ,\
2:36\
the sufferers would rally at once; they\
were healed almost instantly.”\
2:42\
Ephraim Hanks will forever be a hero\
to those handcart pioneers.\
2:47\
Similar to that remarkable rescue,\
events which impact our lives and even\
2:52\
the course of history are frequently\
the result of decisions\
2:55\
and achievements of individual men and\
women—great artists, scientists,\
3:00\
business leaders, and even politicians.\
3:03\
These extraordinary individuals are\
often honored as heroes with monuments\
3:08\
and memorials built to commemorate\
their exploits.\
3:11\
When I was a young boy, my first\
heroes were athletes.\
3:15\
My earliest memories are collecting\
baseball cards with the pictures\
3:19\
and statistics of Major League\
Baseball players.\
3:22\
Hero worship as a child can\
be fun and even innocent,\
3:26\
such as children dressing up as their\
favorite superheroes for Halloween.\
3:31\
Although we admire and respect many\
talented and remarkable men and women\
3:35\
for their abilities and contributions,\
the degree to which they are “revered,”\
3:40\
if taken to an excess, can\
be the equivalent of\
3:43\
the children of Israel worshiping a\
golden calf in the desert of Sinai.\
3:48\
As adults, what was once innocent\
childhood fun can become\
3:52\
a stumbling block when “hero worship” of\
politicians, bloggers, influencers,\
3:58\
athletes, or musicians causes\
us to “[look] beyond the mark”\
4:02\
and lose sight of what is truly\
essential. For the children of Israel,\
4:07\
the challenge was not the gold\
that they brought with them\
4:10\
on their journey to the Promised Land,\
4:12\
but rather what they allowed\
the gold to become—an idol,\
4:16\
which then became the object\
of their worship,\
4:19\
turning their attention away\
from Jehovah who had parted\
4:22\
the Red Sea and delivered\
them from bondage.\
4:25\
Their focus on the calf impacted their\
ability to worship the true God.\
4:31\
The Hero, our Hero, now and\
always is Jesus Christ.\
4:36\
And any thing or any one that distracts\
us from His teachings—as found in\
4:42\
the scriptures and through the\
words of living prophets—\
4:45\
can negatively impact our progress\
on the covenant path.\
4:50\
Before the creation of this world,\
we looked to Jesus Christ\
4:52\
when it became clear that the plan\
proposed by Father in Heaven,\
4:56\
which included our opportunity to\
progress and become like Him,\
5:00\
was being challenged. Not only was Jesus\
Christ the leader in defending\
5:05\
our Father’s plan, but\
He would also play\
5:07\
the most crucial role in\
its implementation.\
5:10\
He responded to the Father and\
volunteered to offer Himself\
5:14\
“a ransom for all” to pay a debt that\
each of us would incur through sin\
5:20\
but could not pay on our own.\
President Dallin H. Oaks\
5:23\
has taught, “Jesus Christ has done\
everything that is essential\
5:28\
for our journey through mortality\
toward the destiny outlined in\
5:31\
the plan of our Heavenly Father.”\
In the Garden of Gethsemane,\
5:37\
when faced with such an\
overwhelming task,\
5:39\
the Savior bravely stated, “Not\
my will, but thine be done,”\
5:44\
and proceeded to take upon Himself the\
combined pains, the sicknesses,\
5:49\
and the suffering for the sins\
of all who would ever live.\
5:52\
In a perfect act of obedience\
and commitment,\
5:56\
Jesus Christ completed the supreme\
heroic act in all of creation,\
6:01\
culminating in His glorious\
resurrection.\
6:05\
In our most recent general conference,\
6:07\
President Russell M. Nelson reminded us,\
6:09\
“Whatever questions or\
problems you have,\
6:12\
the answer is always found in the life\
and teachings of Jesus Christ.\
6:17\
Learn more about His Atonement, His\
love, His mercy, His doctrine,\
6:22\
and His restored gospel of healing\
and progression. Turn to him!\
6:27\
Follow him!”\
And I would add, choose Him.\
6:32\
In our complex world, it can be tempting\
to turn to society’s “heroes” in\
6:37\
an effort to provide clarity to life\
when it may seem confusing\
6:40\
or even overwhelming. We buy\
the clothes they sponsor,\
6:44\
we embrace the politics they espouse,\
6:46\
and we follow their suggestions\
as shared on social media.\
6:50\
This might be fine for a\
temporary diversion,\
6:52\
but we must be watchful that this form\
of hero worship does not become our\
6:57\
golden calf. Choosing the “right”\
hero has eternal consequences.\
7:03\
When our family arrived in Spain to\
begin our service as mission leaders,\
7:07\
we found a framed quote from Elder Neal\
A. Maxwell that has relevance to\
7:11\
the heroes we choose to follow.\
7:13\
He stated, “If you have not chosen\
the kingdom of God first,\
7:18\
it will in the end make no difference\
what you have chosen instead.”\
7:24\
Brothers and sisters, it is\
by choosing Jesus Christ,\
7:27\
the King of kings that we choose\
the kingdom of God.\
7:30\
Any other choice is the equivalent\
of choosing the arm of flesh or\
7:35\
a golden calf and will\
ultimately fail us.\
7:39\
In the Old Testament book of Daniel,\
we read the account of Shadrach,\
7:43\
Meshach, and Abednego, who clearly\
know which hero to choose.\
7:47\
And it was not any of the gods\
of King Nebuchadnezzar.\
7:50\
They confidently declared, “Our God whom\
we serve is able to deliver us from\
7:56\
the burning, fiery furnace.\
7:58\
But if not, be it known\
unto thee, O King,\
8:01\
that we will not serve thy gods\
nor worship the golden image.”\
8:06\
As the Apostle Paul has taught,\
“There be gods many”—\
8:10\
and I may add “heroes many”—to whom\
we are invited to bow down,\
8:14\
to worship, and to embrace.\
8:17\
But just as Daniel's three friends knew,\
8:19\
there was only one that is guaranteed\
to deliver because He already has.\
8:24\
And He always will. For us on our\
journey back to the presence of God,\
8:30\
to our promised land, it’s not the\
politician, it’s not the musician,\
8:35\
the athlete, or the vlogger\
that is the issue,\
8:38\
but rather choosing to\
allow them to become\
8:40\
the primary objects of our attention\
and focus in place of our Savior\
8:45\
and Redeemer. We choose Him,\
8:48\
Jesus Christ, when we choose\
to honor His day,\
8:52\
whether we're at home or\
traveling on vacation.\
8:55\
We choose Him when we choose His words\
through the scriptures and\
8:59\
the teachings of living prophets.\
9:01\
We choose Him when we choose\
to hold a temple\
9:04\
recommend and live worthy of its use.\
9:07\
We choose Him when we are peacemakers\
and refuse to be contentious,\
9:11\
especially when we have differences\
of opinion.\
9:16\
No leader has ever shown more courage,\
no humanitarian more kindness.\
9:22\
No physician has cured more disease,\
9:24\
and no artist has been more creative\
than Jesus Christ.\
9:28\
In a world of heroes with monuments\
and museums devoted to\
9:32\
the exploits of mortal men and women,\
9:35\
there is One who stands\
above all others.\
9:38\
I testify that Jesus Christ is not only\
our Hero, He is our Lord, our King,\
9:45\
the Savior and Redeemer of mankind. In\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
