My dear brothers and sisters,\
0:04\
my thoughts today are on the\
gathering of Israel,\
0:08\
what President Russell M. Nelson calls\
“the most important thing taking place\
0:14\
on earth today. Nothing else\
compares in magnitude,\
0:18\
nothing else compares in importance,\
nothing else compares in majesty.”\
0:24\
The gathering is the ultimate\
recognition that\
0:28\
“the worth of souls is great\
in the sight of God.”\
0:31\
It is as simple as that. We are\
gathering God's children in these last\
0:37\
days that they might have “blessings\
poured out upon their heads” and\
0:42\
the promises of\
“the riches of eternity.”\
0:46\
It follows that to gather Israel,\
0:49\
we need missionaries—many\
more than are serving.\
0:55\
Today I am speaking to the\
many seasoned seniors in\
0:59\
the Church who could serve as\
missionaries. The Lord needs you.\
1:05\
We need you in New York and Chicago,\
Australia and Africa,\
1:10\
Thailand and Mexico, and\
everywhere in between.\
1:15\
Let me take you back to the year 2015.\
1:20\
I was a newly called member of the\
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\
1:24\
One of the wonderful responsibilities\
we carry\
1:27\
as apostles is to assign missionaries\
to their fields of labor.\
1:33\
I had participated as a Seventy in the\
process, but now as an Apostle,\
1:39\
I felt the full weight\
of the assignment.\
1:43\
I began with prayerfully placing\
a great number of young elders\
1:48\
and sisters, one by one, in missions\
around the world.\
1:53\
Then I turned to the senior couples.\
There were ten on the list.\
1:59\
Not very many. Surprised,\
2:02\
I asked my associate from the\
missionary department,\
2:05\
“How many do we need this week to fill\
the requests?” He responded, “300.”\
2:13\
That sobering moment has stayed with me.\
Ten couples to fill 300 requests.\
2:23\
President Nelson has encouraged\
couples to “get on their knees\
2:28\
and ask Heavenly Father if the time is\
right for them to serve a mission.”\
2:34\
Of all the qualifications, he said,\
2:36\
“a desire to serve may be\
the most important.”\
2:42\
As the scripture says, “If ye\
have desires to serve God,\
2:47\
ye are called to the work.” That work\
is all about the law of the harvest. We\
2:53\
read in John, “both he that soweth and\
he that reapeth may rejoice together.”\
3:03\
I have seen the law of the harvest\
fulfilled in my own family.\
3:08\
Some years ago I was visiting family\
when the bishop asked me to conclude\
3:13\
the sacrament service. As I was\
coming down from the stand,\
3:18\
a woman approached me with her seven\
children and introduced herself\
3:23\
as Sister Rebecca Guzman. She asked\
“Elder Rasband, Do you know Rulon\
3:31\
and Verda Rasband?” I beamed and\
replied, “They are my parents.”\
3:41\
You can see where this is going.\
3:43\
With Rebecca’s permission, who is here\
with family in the Conference Center,\
3:49\
I share her family's story.\
3:52\
My parents, Elder Rulon and Sister\
Verda Rasband were serving as\
3:58\
a senior couple in the Fort Lauderdale\
Florida Mission.\
4:03\
They were proselyting and\
by divine guidance,\
4:06\
knocked on the door of Rebecca's home.\
4:09\
She was just a teenager, and she\
loved listening to the music of\
4:14\
the Osmonds, in particular,\
4:17\
our friend Donny, who is\
here with us today.\
4:22\
She had listened to their\
media interviews\
4:24\
and learned they were members of\
4:26\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
4:30\
She felt there was something\
different about them\
4:33\
and thinking it might be their religion,\
4:36\
Rebecca spent two years researching\
the Church’s beliefs in\
4:41\
the school library. So when a kindly\
looking couple knocked\
4:45\
on her family's door and\
introduced themselves\
4:49\
as Latter-day Saint missionaries,\
she was taken aback.\
4:54\
“My mother told me to get rid of them,”\
Rebecca later wrote.\
4:58\
“But my heart said no. I looked into\
their faces and I felt so much warmth\
5:07\
and love. The memory still\
brings tears to my eyes\
5:11\
and deep emotion to my heart.”\
5:14\
Rebecca invited them in and my\
missionary parents shared\
5:18\
a message with her, her two younger\
sisters, and, despite her objections,\
5:24\
her mother. Rebecca described to me:\
“Both your parents were wonderful in\
5:30\
explaining any questions we had.\
5:33\
I can still see their faces, as if there\
was light surrounding them.\
5:38\
We always hugged your mother\
when she left,\
5:42\
and she always made a point of helping\
my mother feel comfortable\
5:47\
and respected. Your father always\
had a sparkle in his eyes\
5:52\
as he was teaching us\
about Jesus Christ.\
5:55\
He tried to include my father in\
discussions and eventually won him over.\
6:02\
My father was a chef at\
a local country club\
6:06\
and started cooking\
dinners for your parents,\
6:09\
including making your father’s\
favorite—Key Lime Pie.”\
6:15\
When Elder and Sister Rasband asked\
Rebecca and her family to read\
6:19\
the Book of Mormon, Rebecca\
did so in five days.\
6:23\
She wanted to be baptized immediately,\
6:27\
but the other members of her\
family were not ready.\
6:30\
After four months, Rebecca insisted she\
be baptized and join the true Church.\
6:37\
She recalled, “Every fiber of\
my soul knew it was true.\
6:45\
On April 5, 1979, missionaries\
baptized 19-year-old Rebecca,\
6:51\
her mother, and two sisters. My father\
was a witness at the baptism.\
6:58\
When I met Rebecca and\
her family at church,\
7:01\
we took a photograph of\
her family with me.\
7:05\
I took it home to my elderly mother,\
and she held it close to her heart.\
7:11\
Then she said to me. “Ronnie,\
7:17\
this is one of the happiest\
days of my life.”\
7:23\
My mother’s response begs the\
question for our seniors:\
7:29\
What are you doing at this\
stage of your life?\
7:32\
There are so many ways senior\
missionaries can do what no one else\
7:36\
can. You are a remarkable\
force for good,\
7:40\
seasoned in the Church and poised to\
encourage and rescue God’s children.\
7:46\
Some of you might be thinking,\
7:49\
“But what about leaving the\
grandchildren?\
7:52\
We would miss family milestones,\
birthdays, friends, and even our pets.”\
7:59\
If I had asked my mother why she\
and dad went on a mission,\
8:03\
I know she would have said this:\
“I have grandchildren.\
8:08\
I want them to know that your father\
and I served in the mission field.\
8:16\
We wanted to set an example for our\
posterity, and we were blessed,\
8:22\
so blessed.” As I have visited\
missions around the world,\
8:27\
I have seen the remarkable service of\
our legion of senior missionaries.\
8:33\
It is clear they are happy doing the\
will of the Lord and being about\
8:37\
the Lord’s business. For some—\
8:40\
and we hope thousands of you—full-time\
missionary service in another corner\
8:46\
of the world will be just the\
right place. For others,\
8:51\
serving a Church service mission\
at home might be preferable.\
8:55\
Because of health issues\
or other circumstances,\
8:59\
there are those who are unable to serve.\
9:02\
We understand those situations,\
9:05\
and it would be my hope you might find\
ways to support those who are serving.\
9:12\
Follow the Prophet's counsel\
and pray to know what\
9:15\
the Lord would have you do.\
9:17\
Mission fields around the world\
are pleading for your help.\
9:22\
President Nelson has said of\
our senior missionaries,\
9:26\
“They are young in spirit, wise\
and willing to work.”\
9:31\
Out in the field, you have a smorgasbord\
of opportunities:\
9:35\
you may serve in mission\
offices or temples,\
9:38\
strengthen young missionaries,\
bolster small branches,\
9:42\
work in family history centers or at\
historic sites, teach institute,\
9:48\
provide humanitarian service,\
work with young adults,\
9:52\
help in employment centers,\
or on Church farms.\
9:57\
The particulars of ways to serve,\
what best suits you,\
10:02\
where you are needed, and how you can\
get ready to go are addressed on\
10:07\
the website “Senior Missionary.”\
10:10\
You can also talk with your bishop\
or branch president.\
10:15\
I have called many couples\
to serve and watched as\
10:17\
the light of Christ has filled\
their countenances.\
10:21\
At their return, they have described\
growing closer to the Lord\
10:25\
and closer to one another,\
10:27\
feeling the Spirit of the\
Lord pour down upon them\
10:31\
and knowing they are making a\
difference. Who would not want that?\
10:37\
A mission might be the greatest\
chapter in a couple's life.\
10:41\
A good title might be “My Lord\
Will Have Need of Me.”\
10:46\
You may be on unfamiliar ground.\
10:48\
However, the power of the Spirit will\
make you feel right at home.\
10:53\
My parents and tens of thousands of\
returned missionary couples have borne\
10:59\
testimony of the joy they found\
in missionary work.\
11:03\
The Lord has said in latter-day\
scripture: “And if it so be\
11:07\
that ye labor all your days in crying\
repentance unto this people,\
11:12\
and bring save it be one soul unto me,\
11:15\
how great shall be your joy with him\
in the kingdom of my Father!”\
11:21\
Isaiah gave us a poetic description\
of what it means to serve in\
11:25\
the mission “field.” Scripture tells\
us, “the field is the world.”\
11:30\
The great ancient prophet wrote:\
“For ye shall go out with joy,\
11:35\
and be led forth with peace:\
11:37\
the mountains and the hills shall break\
forth before you into singing,\
11:42\
and all the trees of the field\
shall clap their hands.”\
11:47\
The mountains, hills, fields, and trees\
can be likened to mission presidents,\
11:52\
bishops, district leaders, members,\
and those who seek the truth\
11:57\
but they “know not where to\
find it” will testify that\
12:01\
the senior missionaries change\
12:03\
the very landscape with their testimony\
of our Savior and Redeemer,\
12:08\
Jesus Christ.\
12:12\
As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ,\
12:15\
I ask you to serve as a missionary\
in the gathering of Israel\
12:19\
and perhaps even serve again.\
We need you—we need you.\
12:28\
We are grateful to you seniors,\
12:30\
for the lives you have led and\
12:32\
the examples you have been in your\
homes, wards, and stakes.\
12:36\
I now invite you to take your know-how\
coupled with your time-honored\
12:41\
testimonies and go on a mission.\
12:44\
I pray that the next time I sit\
down to assign senior couples,\
12:48\
there will be hundreds of you waiting\
anxiously for your call.\
12:54\
I also promise that as you serve,\
12:57\
you will feel the love of the Lord\
in your life. You will know Him,\
13:02\
He will know you, and “how\
great shall be your joy.”\
13:08\
Your dedicated service to Jesus Christ\
will inspire and bless your family,\
13:14\
your grandchildren, and\
great grandchildren.\
13:18\
Peace and love will be multiplied in\
their lives for years to come.\
13:26\
I promise. In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
