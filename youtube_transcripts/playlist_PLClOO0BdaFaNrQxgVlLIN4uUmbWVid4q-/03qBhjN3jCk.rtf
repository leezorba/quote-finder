In the 1960s, my father taught at the\
Church College of Hawaii in Laie,\
0:06\
where I was born. My seven older sisters\
insisted my parents name me\
0:11\
“Kimo,” a Hawaiian name. We lived near\
0:15\
the Hawaii temple when it served much\
of the Church membership in\
0:18\
the Asia Pacific area, including Japan.\
0:22\
At this time, groups of Japanese saints\
began coming to Hawaii to receive\
0:27\
the blessings of the temple.\
0:29\
One of these members was a sister from\
the beautiful island of Okinawa.\
0:34\
The story of her journey to the Hawaii\
temple is really remarkable.\
0:39\
Two decades earlier, she\
had been married in\
0:42\
a traditional arranged Buddhist wedding.\
0:44\
Just a few months later, Japan attacked\
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,\
0:48\
thrusting the United States into\
a conflict with Japan. In\
0:53\
the wake of battles such\
as Midway and Iwo Jima,\
0:56\
the tides of war pushed the\
Japanese forces back to\
0:59\
the shores of her island home, Okinawa,\
1:02\
the last line of defense standing\
against the allied forces before\
1:06\
the heartlands of Japan. For a harrowing\
three months in 1945,\
1:12\
the battle of Okinawa raged.\
1:14\
A flotilla of 1,300 American warships\
encircled and bombarded the island.\
1:20\
Military and civilian casualties\
were enormous.\
1:24\
Today, a solemn monument in Okinawa\
lists more than 240,000\
1:30\
known names of people who\
perished in the battle.\
1:34\
In a desperate attempt to\
escape the onslaught,\
1:37\
this Okinawan woman and her husband\
1:39\
and their two small children sought\
refuge in a mountain cave.\
1:44\
They endured unspeakable misery through\
the ensuing weeks and months.\
1:49\
One desperate night amidst the battle,\
with her family near starvation\
1:54\
and her husband unconscious,\
1:56\
she contemplated ending their suffering\
with a hand grenade,\
1:59\
which the authorities had supplied to\
her and others for that purpose.\
2:04\
However, as she prepared to do so,\
2:07\
a profoundly spiritual experience\
unfolded that gave her\
2:11\
a tangible sense of the reality\
of God and His love for her,\
2:16\
which gave her the strength to carry on.\
2:19\
In the following days, she revived her\
husband and fed her family with weeds,\
2:24\
honey from a wild beehive, and creatures\
caught in a nearby stream.\
2:29\
Remarkably, they endured six months in\
2:32\
the cave until local villagers informed\
them that the battle had ended.\
2:38\
When the family returned home and\
began rebuilding their lives,\
2:41\
this Japanese woman started searching\
for answers about God.\
2:46\
She gradually kindled a belief in Jesus\
Christ and the need to be baptized.\
2:52\
However, she was concerned about her\
loved ones who had died without\
2:56\
a knowledge of Jesus Christ,\
including her mother,\
2:59\
who died giving birth to her.\
3:02\
Imagine her joy when two sister\
missionaries from\
3:05\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints came to her house one day\
3:10\
and taught her that people can learn\
about Jesus Christ in the spirit world.\
3:14\
She was captivated by the teaching that\
her parents could choose to follow\
3:18\
Jesus Christ after death and\
accept baptism performed\
3:22\
on their behalf in holy\
places called temples.\
3:26\
She and her family were converted\
to the Savior and baptized.\
3:31\
Her family worked hard and began to\
prosper, adding three more children.\
3:36\
They were faithful and\
active in the Church.\
3:39\
Then, unexpectedly, her husband\
suffered a stroke\
3:43\
and died, compelling her to work\
long hours at multiple jobs\
3:48\
for many years to provide\
for her five children.\
3:52\
Some people in her neighborhood\
and family criticized her.\
3:56\
They blamed her troubles on her decision\
to join a Christian church.\
4:02\
Undeterred by profound tragedy\
and harsh criticism,\
4:06\
she held on to her faith in Jesus\
Christ, determined to press forward,\
4:10\
trusting that God knew her and that\
brighter days were ahead.\
4:16\
A few years following her husband's\
untimely death,\
4:19\
the mission president of Japan\
felt inspired to encourage\
4:22\
the Japanese members to work toward\
attending the temple.\
4:26\
The mission president was an American\
veteran of the Battle of Okinawa,\
4:30\
in which this Okinawan sister and\
her family had suffered so much.\
4:35\
Nonetheless, the humble\
sister said of him,\
4:39\
“He was then one of our hated enemies.\
4:42\
But now he was here with the\
gospel of love and peace.\
4:46\
This, to me, was a miracle.”\
4:49\
Upon hearing the mission\
president's message,\
4:51\
the widowed sister desired to be sealed\
to her family in the temple someday.\
4:56\
However, it was impossible for her\
due to financial constraints\
5:00\
and language barriers. Then several\
innovative solutions emerged.\
5:05\
The cost could be reduced by half\
if members in Japan chartered\
5:09\
an entire plane to fly to Hawaii\
in the off season.\
5:13\
Members also recorded and sold vinyl\
records entitled “Japanese Saints Sing.”\
5:20\
Some members even sold homes. Others\
quit their jobs to make the trip.\
5:25\
The challenge for members was that\
5:29\
the temple presentation was\
not available in Japanese.\
5:33\
Church leaders called a Japanese\
brother to travel to\
5:36\
the Hawaiian temple to translate\
the endowment ceremony.\
5:40\
He was the first Japanese\
convert after the war,\
5:43\
having been taught and baptized\
by faithful American soldiers.\
5:48\
When the endowed Japanese members\
living in Hawaii first heard\
5:51\
the translation, they wept.\
One member recorded:\
5:55\
“We’ve been to the temple many,\
many times.\
5:58\
We’ve heard the ceremonies in English.\
6:00\
[But] we have never felt the spirit of\
... temple work as we feel it now\
6:04\
[hearing it] in our own native tongue.”\
6:07\
Later that same year, 161 adults\
6:11\
and children embarked from Tokyo to make\
their way to the Hawaii temple.\
6:15\
One Japanese brother reflected\
on the journey:\
6:18\
“I looked out the window of the airplane\
6:21\
and saw Pearl Harbor and remembered\
what our country had done to these\
6:25\
people on December 7, 1941,\
I feared in my heart.\
6:30\
Will they accept us? But to\
my surprise,\
6:34\
they showed greater love and kindness\
than I have ever seen in my life.”\
6:39\
Upon arrival, the Hawaiian\
members welcomed\
6:42\
the Japanese Saints with countless\
strands of flower leis while exchanging\
6:46\
hugs and kisses on the cheeks, a very\
foreign custom in Japanese culture.\
6:53\
After spending 10 transformative\
days in Hawaii,\
6:56\
the Japanese Saints bid their farewells\
to the melody of “Aloha Oe” sung by\
7:01\
the Hawaiian Saints. The second temple\
trip organized for Japanese members\
7:08\
included the widowed Okinawan sister.\
7:11\
She made the 10,000-mile\
journey thanks to\
7:14\
a generous gift from missionaries\
who had served in her branch\
7:17\
and had eaten many meals at her table.\
7:21\
While in the temple, she shed tears\
of joy as she acted as a proxy\
7:26\
for her mother's baptism and was\
sealed to her deceased husband.\
7:30\
Temple excursions from Japan to Hawaii\
continued regularly until the Tokyo\
7:36\
Japan Temple was dedicated in 1980,\
becoming the 18th temple in operation.\
7:43\
In November of this year,\
7:45\
the 186th temple will\
be dedicated in Okinawa, Japan.\
7:53\
It is located not far from the cave in\
central Okinawa where this woman\
7:58\
and her family sheltered.\
8:01\
Though I never met this wonderful\
sister from Okinawa,\
8:04\
her legacy lives on through\
her faithful posterity,\
8:08\
many of whom I know and love.\
8:11\
My father, a World War II\
veteran of the Pacific,\
8:14\
was thrilled when I received my call to\
serve in Japan as a young missionary.\
8:19\
I arrived in Japan shortly after\
the Tokyo Temple was dedicated\
8:23\
and saw firsthand their\
love for the temple.\
8:28\
Temple covenants are gifts from\
our Heavenly Father to\
8:31\
the faithful followers of\
His Son, Jesus Christ.\
8:34\
Through the temple, our Heavenly Father\
binds individuals and families to\
8:39\
the Savior and to each other. President\
Russell M. Nelson declared last year,\
8:45\
“Each person who makes covenants in\
baptismal fonts and in temples—\
8:50\
and keeps them—has increased access\
to the power of Jesus Christ.\
8:55\
The reward for keeping covenants\
with God is heavenly power,\
8:59\
power that strengthens us\
to withstand our trials,\
9:03\
temptations, and heartaches better.\
This ... eases our way.”\
9:08\
Through temple blessings, the\
Savior heals individuals,\
9:12\
families, and nations, even those that\
once stood as bitter enemies.\
9:17\
The resurrected Lord declared to\
a conflict-ridden society,\
9:21\
to those who honor “my name,\
9:23\
shall the Son of Righteousness arise\
with healing in his wings.”\
9:28\
I am grateful to witness the ongoing\
fulfillment of the Lord's promise that\
9:33\
“the time shall come when\
the knowledge of\
9:36\
a Savior shall spread throughout every\
nation, kindred, tongue, and people,”\
9:41\
including to those “upon\
the isles of the sea.”\
9:45\
I testify of the Savior Jesus Christ\
and of His prophet and apostles\
9:50\
in these latter days. I solemnly\
bear witness of\
9:54\
the heavenly power to bind in heaven\
what is bound on Earth.\
9:58\
This is the Savior’s work, and\
temples are His holy house.\
10:04\
With unwavering conviction,\
10:06\
I declare these truths in the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
