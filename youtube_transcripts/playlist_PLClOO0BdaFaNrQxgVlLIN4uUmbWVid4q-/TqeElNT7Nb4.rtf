Recently, the eyes of the sporting world\
focused on the Women's World Cup,\
0:07\
hosted by Australia and New Zealand.\
0:10\
World-class athletes narrowed from more\
than 200 national teams from around\
0:16\
the globe demonstrated their grit,\
dedication,\
0:20\
talent, and athleticism as they competed\
for the soccer world’s highest honor.\
0:26\
We marvel at performers\
in various sports\
0:29\
and other disciplines who achieve their\
highest level of their art.\
0:33\
We speak of their God-given\
talents or gifts.\
0:36\
This includes those gifted in dance,\
gymnastics, music, art, drama,\
0:41\
mathematics, science, and more.\
0:44\
Each demonstrates God-given gifts that\
are then refined and honed by\
0:49\
a lifetime of hard work,\
study, and practice.\
0:54\
God-given gifts make gifted people.\
0:58\
Looking through a gospel lens,\
1:00\
God endows His children with\
many spiritual gifts,\
1:03\
making them spiritually gifted people.\
1:07\
Covenant-keeping members of the Church\
are bestowed with gifts of the Spirit,\
1:11\
which include the gift of a testimony\
of Jesus Christ as our Savior,\
1:16\
the gift of the Holy Ghost, the gift\
of faith to heal and be healed,\
1:21\
of receiving miracles, and the gifts\
of wisdom and knowledge.\
1:27\
The Lord invites us to earnestly seek\
the best gifts, even spiritual gifts.\
1:32\
He gives spiritual gifts to bless us\
and to use in blessing others.\
1:38\
Returning to our analogy\
of gifted performers,\
1:41\
it is important to remember\
that a gift alone does not\
1:44\
a master make. Extraordinary\
natural talent\
1:48\
notwithstanding, it is through\
painstaking and laborious practice\
1:52\
and effort that performers refine\
1:55\
and hone their craft to reach their\
highest levels of artistry.\
1:59\
Even gifts received and unwrapped\
are often accompanied by\
2:04\
the dreaded language “some\
assembly required.”\
2:09\
Likewise, I have observed a learning\
curve associated with spiritual gifts.\
2:15\
Exercising spiritual gifts requires\
spiritual exercise.\
2:20\
“Having the guidance of the Holy Ghost\
in your life requires spiritual work.\
2:25\
This work includes fervent prayer\
and scripture study.\
2:28\
It includes keeping your covenants\
and God’s commandments. ...\
2:32\
It includes worthily partaking\
of the sacrament each week.”\
2:37\
What is the fruit of exercising\
spiritual gifts?\
2:41\
They include promptings from\
2:42\
the Spirit that help us face our daily\
needs and show us what to do and say.\
2:47\
Blessings of peace and comfort. As we\
listen and act on spiritual promptings,\
2:54\
the Holy Ghost magnifies our abilities\
2:56\
and capacities to far exceed\
what we can do on our own.\
3:01\
These precious spiritual gifts will help\
us in every aspect of our lives.\
3:07\
The constant companionship of\
the Holy Ghost is one of\
3:12\
the greatest spiritual gifts\
Latter-day Saints enjoy.\
3:15\
How important is this gift?\
3:18\
President Russell M. Nelson answered\
this question categorically when he\
3:22\
stated that “in coming days it will not\
be possible to survive spiritually\
3:28\
without the guiding, directing,\
comforting, and constant influence of\
3:32\
the Holy Ghost.” Over the\
course of my ministry,\
3:36\
I've found a universal longing by\
everyone to know how to invite\
3:41\
and recognize the promptings\
of the Holy Ghost.\
3:44\
Such promptings are very personal\
and come in different ways.\
3:49\
We are, however, blessed to have words\
of prophets, both ancient and modern,\
3:54\
give us valuable insights about how to\
receive direction from the Spirit.\
4:00\
Let me offer four guiding principles\
that may be of assistance to you in\
4:04\
recognizing the promptings\
of the Spirit.\
4:09\
The first is to stand in holy places.\
4:13\
I recently participated in the Tokyo\
Japan Temple open house.\
4:18\
The response to formal invitations\
sent to both media\
4:22\
and VIP guests far exceeded\
expectations.\
4:25\
Hundreds joined in these\
guided temple tours.\
4:28\
Guests were deeply touched by\
the beauty of the temple,\
4:32\
including patterns and motifs with deep\
traditional Japanese connections.\
4:38\
More poignant yet was the reverent\
4:40\
and respectful reaction\
elicited from guests\
4:44\
as ancestral ordinances were described\
in rooms where they would occur.\
4:50\
But most heartwarming were the\
stirrings of the Spirit.\
4:55\
One such moment with a prominent\
government official remains etched in\
5:00\
my mind. Following a moment\
of meditative silence in\
5:04\
the celestial room, emotional\
and deeply touched,\
5:07\
he whispered in my ear, “Even\
the air in the room—that\
5:11\
I breathe in this room feels different.”\
5:15\
I recognized he was trying to describe\
the presence of the Holy Spirit,\
5:19\
which indeed dwells in sacred spaces.\
5:23\
If you hope to feel the Spirit,\
5:26\
be in a place where the Spirit\
can easily dwell,\
5:30\
Our temples and homes are\
5:32\
the most sacred of these dedicated\
spaces. In them\
5:35\
we more easily invite and\
recognize the Spirit.\
5:40\
Other holy places include\
meetinghouses,\
5:42\
seminary buildings and institutes,\
and Church history sites\
5:46\
and visitor centers. Stand\
in holy places.\
5:50\
Secondly, stand with holy people.\
5:54\
I’ll describe the second guiding\
principle with another memory. I’ll\
5:59\
never forget participating\
in a devotional held in\
6:02\
a popular sports arena. Usually this\
arena was filled with raucous fans\
6:07\
cheering their home team and perhaps\
even jeering their opponent.\
6:12\
But on this night, the atmosphere\
was quite different.\
6:16\
The arena was filled with thousands\
of young people assembled to honor\
6:20\
and commemorate the life of\
the prophet Joseph Smith.\
6:24\
Their reverent, quiet tone;\
6:26\
gratitude; and prayerful hearts filled\
the arena with the presence of\
6:31\
the Holy Spirit. I could literally\
see it in their faces.\
6:36\
It was the gift of the\
Holy Ghost in action,\
6:39\
affirming the testimonies being born of\
Joseph Smith and the Restoration of\
6:44\
the gospel. The Spirit cannot\
be restrained from attending\
6:49\
a gathering of holy people.\
6:52\
If you hope to feel the Spirit,\
6:54\
be with people where the Spirit\
can easily dwell.\
6:58\
The Savior said it in this way,\
7:00\
“For where two or three are gathered\
together in my name, there am I in\
7:05\
the midst of them.” For young people,\
7:09\
consider your gatherings of holy\
people: quorums and classes,\
7:14\
FSY and seminary, ward and stake\
activities, and even ward choirs.\
7:20\
Choose to be with people and go to\
places where righteousness is found.\
7:24\
Find your strength in numbers. Find\
good friends. Be good friends.\
7:29\
Support one another wherever you are.\
Stand with holy people.\
7:35\
Third, testify of the holy truths\
as often as you can.\
7:39\
The Comforter always shares His voice,\
7:43\
when we testify with our voice.\
7:45\
The Spirit bears witness to the\
speaker and listener alike.\
7:50\
I remember once taking a 45-minute\
taxi ride in New York City.\
7:55\
Having had a warm gospel conversation\
with the driver for\
7:59\
the duration of my ride to the airport,\
8:01\
I paid her and prepared\
to exit the taxi\
8:06\
when I realized I had not\
offered a testimony.\
8:11\
Pausing, I shared a simple short\
testimony, inviting the Spirit,\
8:16\
bringing tears to both\
our eyes. As you seek\
8:21\
and take opportunities to share\
your testimony with others,\
8:25\
you will create moments to recognize\
the Spirit for yourself.\
8:31\
The final principle is to listen\
to the Holy Spirit.\
8:35\
He can be our constant companion, but\
speaks in subtle, quiet tones.\
8:41\
The prophet Elijah found that the\
voice of the Lord was not in\
8:45\
the wind, the earthquake, or the fire,\
but “was a still small voice.”\
8:50\
It is not “a voice of thunder,”\
8:52\
but rather “a still voice of perfect\
mildness, as if it had been a whisper,”\
8:59\
and yet it can “pierce even\
to the very soul.”\
9:02\
President Boyd K. Packer stated,\
9:04\
“The Spirit does not get our attention\
by shouting or shaking us with\
9:07\
a heavy hand. Rather it whispers.\
9:10\
It caresses so gently that if we are\
preoccupied, we may not feel it at all.”\
9:17\
I have observed that sometimes His\
voice is so subtle or I am\
9:21\
so preoccupied that a loved\
one captures it for me.\
9:25\
Many have been the times\
that promptings of\
9:27\
the Holy Ghost have come to\
me through my wife, Lesa.\
9:31\
Righteous parents or leaders may also\
receive inspired guidance for you.\
9:36\
The noise, clamor, and contention\
prevalent in\
9:39\
the world may overpower still, quiet\
impressions of the Holy Spirit.\
9:45\
Find a quiet place, a holy space, where\
you can seek to receive direction from\
9:51\
the Spirit. As you consider these\
principles to invite and recognize\
9:55\
the Spirit, consider the following\
words of cautionary guidance.\
10:00\
For example, impressions from\
the Spirit will align with\
10:05\
the scriptures and the teachings\
of living prophets.\
10:09\
Be certain that the feelings you receive\
are consistent with your\
10:12\
assignment. Unless you’re called\
by proper authority,\
10:15\
impressions from the Spirit are\
not given for you to counsel\
10:19\
or correct others. Spiritual\
matters cannot be forced.\
10:24\
You can cultivate an attitude and an\
environment that invite the Spirit\
10:28\
and you can prepare yourself,\
10:30\
but you cannot dictate how or\
when inspiration comes.\
10:35\
Be patient and trust that you will\
receive what you need when\
10:39\
the time is right. Use your\
own best judgment.\
10:43\
Sometimes we want to be led by\
the Spirit in all things.\
10:46\
However, often the Lord wants us to\
use our God-given intelligence\
10:51\
and act in ways that are consistent\
with our best understanding.\
10:56\
President Dallin H. Oaks taught, quote,\
10:59\
“A desire to be led by the\
Spirit is a strength,\
11:01\
but it needs to be accompanied by\
11:03\
an understanding that our Heavenly\
Father leaves many decisions\
11:07\
for our personal choices. ...\
11:09\
Persons who try to shift all decision\
making to the Lord and plead for\
11:13\
a revelation in every choice will soon\
find circumstances in which they pray\
11:18\
for guidance and don’t receive it. ...\
11:21\
We should study things out in our minds.\
... Then we should pray for guidance\
11:25\
and act upon it. ... If we do\
not receive guidance,\
11:28\
we should use our best judgment,”\
close quote.\
11:32\
In conclusion, Latter-day Saints should\
be gifted, covenant-keeping people.\
11:39\
Nonetheless, it remains for each of us\
to seek to exercise our spiritual gifts\
11:43\
and then invite and learn to recognize\
the promptings of the Spirit.\
11:48\
Four guiding principles to assist us in\
this crucial spiritual endeavor\
11:52\
are: Stand in holy places. Stand with\
holy people. Testify of holy truths.\
11:58\
Listen to the Spirit. Your ability\
to invite and recognize\
12:02\
the promptings of the Spirit will\
develop a step at a time.\
12:06\
Becoming more attuned\
to the language of\
12:08\
the Spirit is like learning\
another language.\
12:11\
It is a gradual process that requires\
diligent, patient effort.\
12:17\
Returning to where we began, please\
remember that as Latter-day Saints,\
12:21\
you are gifted. Picture this familiar\
fast Sunday scene recently described\
12:26\
to me. A young child standing on a\
stool, barely visible over\
12:31\
the pulpit. Her father\
stood next to her,\
12:33\
offering encouragement and assisting\
with soft whispers to her ear\
12:38\
as she proudly shared,\
“I am a child of God.”\
12:42\
The testimony that followed came from\
a young adult who began with\
12:46\
a nervous quip: “I wish I had someone\
whispering in my ear like that.”\
12:52\
Then she had a flash of inspiration\
and testified,\
12:57\
“I do have someone whispering in my\
ear like that: the Holy Ghost!”\
13:02\
I close with an invitation\
especially for all youth.\
13:07\
Many of you start your day by standing\
in front of a mirror. Tomorrow, this\
13:12\
week, this year, always, pause as you\
look at yourself in the mirror.\
13:18\
Think to yourself or say aloud if you\
like, “Wow, look at me! I am amazing!\
13:25\
I’m a child of God! He knows me!\
He loves me! I’m gifted—\
13:32\
gifted with the Holy Ghost\
as my constant companion!”\
13:38\
I add my testimony to you,\
13:41\
gifted Latter-day Saints,\
of God the Father,\
13:44\
Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost,\
who bears testimony of them. In\
13:51\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
