Thank Elder Renlund for your\
beautiful message.\
0:04\
Brothers and sisters, thank you for\
your devotion to God the Father\
0:09\
and to His Son, Jesus Christ.\
0:10\
And thank you for your love\
and service to each other.\
0:13\
You truly are remarkable.\
0:16\
Many years ago, after receiving a call\
to serve as full-time mission leaders,\
0:20\
our family determined to learn each\
missionary's name before arriving in\
0:24\
the field. We obtained photos,\
created flashcards,\
0:27\
and began studying faces\
and memorizing names.\
0:30\
Once we arrived, we held introductory\
conferences with the missionaries. As\
0:35\
we mingled, I overheard our nine-year-\
old son, “Nice to meet you, Sam.”\
0:41\
“Rachel, where are you from?” “Wow,\
David, you are tall!” Alarmed,\
0:48\
I went to our son and whispered, “Hey,\
0:51\
let’s remember to refer to the\
missionaries as Elder or Sister.”\
0:55\
He gave me a puzzled look and said,\
“Dad,\
0:58\
I thought we were supposed\
to memorize their names.”\
1:03\
Our son did what he thought was right\
based on his understanding.\
1:09\
So what is our understanding\
of truth in today's world?\
1:13\
We are constantly bombarded with strong\
opinions, biased reporting,\
1:17\
and incomplete data. At the same time,\
1:20\
the volume and sources of this\
information are proliferating.\
1:23\
Our need to recognize truth has\
never been more important.\
1:27\
Truth is critical for us to establish\
1:30\
and strengthen our relationship\
with God, find peace and joy,\
1:33\
and reach our divine potential. Today,\
let’s consider the following questions:\
1:39\
What is truth and why is it important?\
How do we find truth?\
1:44\
And when we find truth,\
how can we share it?\
1:48\
The Lord has taught us in scripture\
that “truth is knowledge of things\
1:51\
as they are, as they were,\
and as they are to come.”\
1:54\
It “was not created or\
made” and has “no end.”\
1:57\
Truth is absolute, fixed, and immutable.\
In other words, truth is eternal.\
2:04\
Truth helps us avoid deception,\
discern good from evil,\
2:08\
receive protection, and find\
comfort and healing.\
2:11\
Truth can also guide our actions,\
make us free, sanctify us,\
2:16\
and lead us to eternal life.\
2:19\
God reveals eternal truth to us through\
2:21\
a network of revelatory relationships\
involving Himself, Jesus Christ,\
2:28\
the Holy Ghost, prophets, and us.\
2:33\
Let's discuss the distinct\
2:34\
yet interconnected roles each\
participant plays in this process.\
2:38\
First, God is the source\
of eternal truth.\
2:42\
He and His Son, Jesus Christ,\
2:44\
have a perfect understanding of truth\
2:47\
and always act in harmony with\
true principles and laws.\
2:51\
This power allows them to create and\
govern worlds as well as to love,\
2:55\
guide, and nurture each\
one of us perfectly.\
2:59\
They want us to understand and\
apply truth so we can enjoy\
3:04\
the blessings they do. They\
may impart truth in person\
3:07\
or more typically through\
messengers such as\
3:09\
the Holy Ghost, angels,\
or living prophets.\
3:13\
Second, the Holy Ghost testifies\
of all truth.\
3:17\
He reveals truths to us directly and\
witnesses of truth taught by others.\
3:22\
Impressions come from the Spirit.\
3:24\
Impressions from the Spirit typically\
come as thoughts to our minds\
3:28\
or feelings to our hearts.\
3:30\
Third, prophets receive truths from\
God and share that truth with us.\
3:35\
We learn the truth from past\
prophets in the scriptures\
3:38\
and from living prophets\
at general conference\
3:41\
and through other official channels.\
3:43\
Finally, you and I play a crucial\
role in this process.\
3:48\
God expects us to seek, recognize,\
and act on truth.\
3:54\
Our ability to receive and apply\
truth is dependent on\
3:58\
the strength of our relationship\
with the Father and the Son,\
4:01\
our responsiveness to the influence of\
4:03\
the Holy Ghost, and our alignment\
with latter-day prophets.\
4:08\
We need to remember that Satan\
works to keep us from truth.\
4:11\
He knows that without truth, we\
cannot gain eternal life.\
4:15\
He weaves strands of truth with worldly\
philosophies to confuse us\
4:19\
and distract us from what\
is communicated by God.\
4:23\
As we seek eternal truth,\
4:25\
the following two questions can\
help us recognize whether\
4:28\
a concept comes from God\
or from another source.\
4:32\
First, is the concept taught\
consistently in the scriptures\
4:35\
and by living prophets? And second,\
is the concept confirmed by\
4:40\
the witness of the Holy Ghost?\
4:43\
God reveals doctrinal truths\
through prophets,\
4:47\
and the Holy Ghost confirms those truths\
to us and helps us apply them.\
4:51\
We must seek and be prepared to receive\
these spiritual impressions when they\
4:55\
come. We're most receptive\
to the witness of\
4:58\
the Spirit when we are humble,\
4:59\
pray sincerely, and study God’s words\
and keep His commandments.\
5:04\
Once the Holy Ghost confirms\
a specific truth to us,\
5:08\
our understanding deepens as we put\
that principle into practice.\
5:12\
Over time, as we consistently\
live the principle,\
5:15\
we gain a sure knowledge of that truth.\
5:18\
For example, I've made mistakes and\
felt remorse for poor choices.\
5:22\
But through prayer, study, and\
faith in Jesus Christ,\
5:26\
I received a witness of the principle of\
repentance. As I continued to repent,\
5:31\
my understanding of repentance\
grew stronger.\
5:34\
I felt closer to God and His Son.\
5:36\
I now know that sin can be forgiven\
through Jesus Christ because\
5:40\
I experienced the blessings\
of repentance each day.\
5:45\
So what should we do when we sincerely\
seek for a truth not yet revealed?\
5:49\
I have empathy for those\
of us who yearn\
5:51\
for answers that do not seem to come. To\
Joseph Smith the Lord counseled,\
5:57\
“Hold your peace until I shall see fit\
to make all things known ... concerning\
6:01\
the matter.” And to Emma Smith,\
He explained,\
6:03\
“Murmur not because of the things\
which thou hast not seen,\
6:06\
for they are withheld from thee\
and from the world,\
6:09\
which is wisdom in me\
in a time to come.”\
6:12\
I, too, have sought answers to heartfelt\
questions. Many answers have come.\
6:17\
Some have not. As we hold on, trusting\
God’s wisdom and love,\
6:22\
keeping His commandments, and\
relying on what we do know,\
6:26\
He helps us find peace until He reveals\
the truth of all things.\
6:32\
When seeking truth, it\
helps to understand\
6:35\
the difference between\
doctrine and policy.\
6:38\
Doctrine refers to eternal truths such\
as the nature of the Godhead, the\
6:42\
plan of salvation, and Jesus Christ’s\
atoning sacrifice.\
6:46\
Policy is the application of doctrine\
based on current circumstances.\
6:51\
Policy helps us administer the\
Church in an orderly way.\
6:55\
While doctrine never changes, policy\
adjusts from time to time.\
7:00\
The Lord works through His prophets\
to uphold His doctrine\
7:03\
and to modify Church policies according\
to the needs of His children.\
7:08\
Unfortunately, we sometimes confuse\
policy with doctrine. If we do not\
7:13\
understand the difference,\
7:14\
we risk becoming disillusioned\
when policies change,\
7:17\
causing some to question God's wisdom\
or the revelatory role of prophets.\
7:23\
When we obtain truth from God,\
7:25\
He encourages us to share that\
knowledge with others.\
7:27\
We do this when we teach\
a class, guide a child,\
7:31\
or discuss gospel truths with a friend.\
7:33\
Our aim is to teach truth in a way that\
invites the converting power of\
7:39\
the Holy Ghost. Let me share some\
simple invitations from the Lord\
7:43\
and His prophets that can help.\
7:46\
Center on Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ,\
and Their fundamental doctrine.\
7:51\
Stay grounded in the scriptures\
and the teachings of\
7:53\
the latter-day prophets. Rely\
7:56\
on doctrine established through multiple\
authoritative witnesses.\
8:01\
Avoid speculation, personal\
opinions, or worldly ideas.\
8:05\
Teach a point of doctrine within the\
context of related gospel truths.\
8:10\
Use teaching methods that invite\
the influence of the Spirit.\
8:14\
Communicate clearly to avoid\
misunderstanding.\
8:19\
Now, how we teach truth really matters.\
8:22\
Paul encouraged us to speak the\
“truth in love.” Truth has\
8:27\
the best chance of blessing another\
when conveyed with Christlike love.\
8:31\
Truth taught without love can\
cause feelings of judgment,\
8:34\
discouragement, and loneliness.\
8:36\
It often leads to resentment and\
division, even conflict.\
8:40\
On the other hand, love without\
truth is hollow and lacks\
8:45\
the promise of growth. Both truth\
and love are essential\
8:49\
for our spiritual development.\
8:51\
Truth provides the doctrine,\
8:53\
principles, and laws necessary\
to gain eternal life,\
8:56\
while love engenders the\
motivation needed to embrace\
8:59\
and act upon what is true. I am forever\
9:02\
grateful for others who patiently\
taught me eternal truth with love.\
9:08\
In conclusion, let me share eternal\
truths that have become\
9:11\
an anchor to my soul. I've come to\
know these truths by following\
9:15\
the principles discussed today. I know\
that God is our Heavenly Father.\
9:20\
He is all-knowing, all-powerful,\
and perfectly loving.\
9:24\
He created a plan for us to gain eternal\
life and to become like Him.\
9:29\
As part of that plan, He sent His Son,\
Jesus Christ, to help us.\
9:33\
Jesus taught us to do the Father’s\
will and to love one another.\
9:36\
He atoned for our sins and gave\
up His life on the cross.\
9:40\
He arose from the dead after three days.\
9:43\
Through Christ and His grace, we will\
be resurrected, we can be forgiven,\
9:49\
and we can find strength in affliction.\
9:51\
During his earthly ministry, Jesus\
established His Church.\
9:55\
Over time, that Church was changed\
and truths were lost.\
9:58\
Jesus restored His Church and the\
truths of the gospel through\
10:01\
the Prophet Joseph Smith.\
10:03\
And today, Christ continues to lead\
His Church through living prophets\
10:07\
and apostles. I know that\
as we come unto Christ,\
10:11\
we can eventually “be perfected in Him,”\
10:13\
obtain “a fulness of joy,” and receive\
“all the Father hath.”\
10:17\
To these eternal truths, I bear witness\
in the holy name of Jesus Christ,\
10:22\
amen.\
