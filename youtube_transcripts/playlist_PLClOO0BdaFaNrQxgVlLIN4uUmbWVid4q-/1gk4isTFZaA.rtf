This morning, I invite you to join\
with me on an African journey.\
0:07\
You won’t see any lions,\
zebras, or elephants,\
0:11\
but perhaps by journey's end,\
0:13\
you will see how thousands\
of members of\
0:15\
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints are responding to Christ’s\
0:20\
second great commandment\
to love thy neighbor.\
0:24\
Imagine for a moment the rural\
red dirt of Africa.\
0:28\
You see from the parched\
and barren earth\
0:32\
that rain has not fallen in any\
measurable quantity for too many years.\
0:37\
The few cattle which cross your\
path are more bones than flesh\
0:42\
and are being driven by a blanket-\
covered curmudgeon herdsman who, with\
0:47\
saddled feet, trudges on in hope of\
finding vegetation and water.\
0:53\
As you navigate the rough\
and rocky road,\
0:56\
you see several groups\
of beautiful children\
0:59\
and wonder why they are not in school.\
The children smile and you wave.\
1:05\
The children smile and wave and you\
wave back with a tear and a smile.\
1:10\
92% of the youngest children you see on\
this journey live in food poverty.\
1:17\
Your heart groans with anguish.\
1:20\
Ahead, you see a mother carrying\
1:22\
a carefully balanced five-gallon\
container of water on her head\
1:27\
and another in her hand. She represents\
one of every two households in this\
1:33\
area where women, young and old,\
1:35\
walk more than 30 minutes each way\
each day to a source of water\
1:40\
for their family. A wave of\
sorrow washes over you.\
1:46\
Two hours pass and you arrive at\
a secluded, shady clearing.\
1:51\
The meeting place is not\
a hall or even a tent,\
1:54\
but rather under a few large trees\
providing shelter from\
1:58\
the sweltering sun. In this place, you\
notice there's no running water,\
2:04\
no electricity, no flush toilets.\
2:07\
You look around and know you are\
amongst people who love God\
2:12\
and you instantly feel\
God's love for them.\
2:15\
They have gathered to receive\
help and hope,\
2:19\
and you have arrived to share it.\
2:23\
Such was the journey of\
Sister Arden and I in\
2:25\
the company of Sister Camille Johnson,\
our general Relief Society president,\
2:30\
and her husband Doug, and\
Sister Sharon Eubank,\
2:33\
director of the Church’s\
humanitarian services,\
2:36\
as we traveled in Uganda, a country of\
47 million people in central Africa.\
2:43\
On that day, under the\
shade of the trees,\
2:47\
we visited a community health project\
that is jointly funded by\
2:51\
the Church Humanitarian Services,\
2:53\
Unicef, and the Ministry of Health\
of the Ugandan government.\
2:58\
These are trusted organizations,\
3:01\
carefully selected to ensure the\
donated humanitarian funds\
3:05\
from members of the Church\
are prudently used.\
3:10\
As heart wrenching as it was to\
see malnourished children and\
3:14\
the effects of tuberculosis, malaria,\
and incessant diarrhea.\
3:19\
There came to each of us\
3:22\
an increase of hope for a better\
tomorrow for those we meet.\
3:27\
That hope came in part through\
3:30\
the kindness of Church members from\
around the world who donate time\
3:34\
and money to the Church\
humanitarian effort.\
3:38\
As I saw the sick and the afflicted\
being helped and lifted,\
3:42\
I bowed my head in gratitude.\
3:45\
At that moment, I better understood\
what was meant by\
3:49\
the King of Kings who said, Come\
ye blessed of my Father,\
3:54\
inherit the kingdom prepared for you,\
for I was an hungered\
3:58\
and you gave me meat. I was thirsty\
and you gave me drink.\
4:04\
I was a stranger and you took me in.\
4:07\
Our Savior's plea is to let your light\
4:10\
so shine before men that they\
may see your good works\
4:13\
and glorify your Father\
which is in heaven.\
4:16\
In that far flung corner of the earth,\
4:19\
your good works brighten the lives\
and lighten the load of\
4:23\
a people in desperate need. And God was\
glorified. On that hot and dusty day,\
4:30\
I wished you could have heard their\
prayers of praise and gratitude to God.\
4:35\
They would have me say to you in their\
native Karamajong: “Alakara.”\
4:41\
Thank you. Our journey reminded\
me of the parable of\
4:45\
the good Samaritan whose journey took\
him on a dusty road not unlike the one\
4:51\
I described, a road that went\
from Jerusalem to Jericho.\
4:56\
This ministering Samaritan teaches us\
what it means to love thy neighbor.\
5:02\
He saw a certain man who\
fell among thieves,\
5:06\
which stripped him of his raiment\
and wounded him and departed,\
5:11\
leaving him half dead. The Samaritan\
had compassion on him.\
5:17\
Compassion is an attribute of Christ.\
5:20\
It is born of love for others\
and knows no boundaries.\
5:24\
Jesus, the Savior of the world,\
is the epitome of compassion.\
5:30\
When we read that Jesus wept, we are\
witnesses, as were Mary and Martha,\
5:35\
of His compassion, which caused Him\
first to groan in the Spirit\
5:40\
and be troubled. In a Book of Mormon\
example of Christ’s compassion,\
5:47\
Jesus appeared to a multitude and said,\
5:51\
Have you any that are lame or blind\
or halt or that are deaf\
5:56\
or that are afflicted in any manner?\
Bring them hither and I will heal them,\
6:02\
for I have compassion upon you.\
And He did heal every one.\
6:10\
Despite our every effort, you\
and I won't heal everyone.\
6:15\
But each of us can be the one who can\
make a difference for good in\
6:20\
the life of someone. It\
was just one lad,\
6:25\
a mere boy who offered the five loaves\
and the two fishes that fed the 5,000.\
6:32\
We may ask of our offering as\
Andrew the disciple did,\
6:36\
of the loaves and fishes. What\
are they among so many?\
6:41\
I assure you it is sufficient to give\
or to do what you are able,\
6:47\
and then to allow Christ to magnify\
your effort on this point.\
6:54\
Elder Jeffrey R. Holland invited us,\
rich or poor,\
6:58\
to do what we can when\
others are in need.\
7:03\
He then testified, as I do,\
7:06\
that God will help you and guide you in\
your compassionate acts of discipleship.\
7:13\
In that distant land, on\
that unforgettable day,\
7:17\
I stood then and stand now as a\
witness of the soul-stirring\
7:24\
and life-changing compassion of members\
of the Church, both rich and poor.\
7:31\
The parable of the good Samaritan\
continues as he bound up\
7:35\
the man's wounds and took care of him.\
7:39\
Our Church humanitarian efforts find us\
quickly responding to natural disasters\
7:45\
and binding up the world's widening\
wounds of disease, hunger,\
7:50\
infant mortality, malnutrition,\
7:53\
displacement, and the often unseen\
wounds of discouragement,\
7:59\
disappointment, and despair.\
8:02\
The Samaritan then took two pence\
and gave them to the host,\
8:08\
and he said unto him, Take care of him.\
8:12\
As a church, we're grateful to\
collaborate with other hosts\
8:17\
or organizations such as Catholic\
Relief Services, UNICEF,\
8:21\
and Red Cross and Red Crescent to\
assist in our humanitarian endeavors.\
8:28\
We are equally grateful for your\
two pence, or two euros, two pesos,\
8:33\
or two shillings that are easing\
the burden that too many around\
8:38\
the world are having to bear.\
8:40\
It is unlikely you will know the\
recipients of your time,\
8:44\
dollars, and dimes. But compassion does\
not require us to know them.\
8:50\
It only requires us to love them.\
8:54\
Thank you, President Nelson,\
8:56\
for reminding us that when we love\
God with all our hearts,\
9:00\
He turns our hearts to the\
well-being of others.\
9:03\
I testify that each of us will have\
an increase of joy, peace,\
9:08\
humility, and love as we respond to\
President Nelson’s call to turn our\
9:14\
hearts to the well-being of others and\
to Joseph Smith's plea to feed\
9:19\
the hungry, clothe the naked,\
provide for the widow,\
9:24\
dry up the tear of the orphan,\
and comfort the afflicted.\
9:28\
Whether in this church or any other,\
or in no church at all,\
9:33\
wherever we find them.\
All those months ago,\
9:38\
we found the hungry and the afflicted\
on a dry and dusty plain,\
9:43\
and were witnesses to their\
pleading eyes for help.\
9:47\
In our own way, we groaned in the\
Spirit and were troubled.\
9:51\
And yet those feelings were\
tempered as we saw\
9:54\
the compassion of Church\
members at work.\
9:56\
As the hungry were fed, the widows\
were provided for, and\
10:00\
the afflicted were comforted,\
and their tears dried up.\
10:05\
May we be forever looking to\
the well-being of others\
10:09\
and show in word and deed that we are\
willing to bear one another's burdens,\
10:15\
to bind up the broken hearted,\
10:18\
and to keep Christ’s second great\
commandment to love thy neighbor.\
10:23\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
