Have you ever held a newborn\
in your arms?\
0:04\
There is a light that emanates\
from every newborn,\
0:07\
bringing a special bond of love that can\
fill their parents’ hearts with joy.\
0:12\
A Mexican writer wrote, “I\
have learned that when\
0:16\
a newborn first squeezes his father's\
finger in his tiny fist,\
0:21\
he has caught him forever.”\
0:23\
Parenting is one of life's most\
extraordinary experiences.\
0:28\
Parents enter a partnership with their\
Heavenly Father to guide their precious\
0:33\
children back to heaven. Today,\
0:36\
I would like to share some parenting\
lessons found in the scriptures\
0:40\
and taught by living prophets to help\
us live our parental legacy.\
0:46\
We must climb to higher ground of\
gospel culture in our families.\
0:51\
President Russell M. Nelson declared,\
“Families deserve guidance from heaven.\
0:58\
Parents cannot counsel children\
1:00\
adequately from personal\
experience, fear, or sympathy.”\
1:06\
Although our cultural backgrounds,\
1:08\
parenting styles, and personal\
experiences may be valuable\
1:12\
for parenting, these abilities are\
insufficient to help our children\
1:18\
return to heaven. We need access to\
a more elevated set of values\
1:22\
and practices, a culture of both love\
1:25\
and expectations where we interact with\
our children in a higher, holier way.\
1:32\
President Dallin H. Oaks described\
gospel culture as, quote,\
1:37\
“a distinctive way of life, a set of\
values and expectations and practices.\
1:43\
... This gospel culture comes from\
the plan of salvation,\
1:46\
the commandments of God, and the\
teachings of living prophets.\
1:50\
It guides us in the way we raise our\
families and live our individual lives.”\
1:56\
End of quote. Jesus Christ is the\
center of this gospel culture.\
2:02\
Adopting the gospel culture in our\
families is critical to creating\
2:07\
a fertile environment where\
2:10\
the seed of faith may flourish.\
To climb to higher ground,\
2:14\
President Oaks invited us, quote,\
2:16\
“to give up any personal\
or family traditions\
2:20\
or practices that are contrary\
to the teachings of\
2:24\
the Church of Jesus Christ,”\
end of quote. Parents,\
2:28\
timidity in our part to establish\
gospel culture may allow\
2:33\
the other side to establish a foothold\
in our homes or even worse,\
2:38\
in the hearts of our children. As we\
choose to make the gospel culture\
2:44\
the predominant culture in our family,\
2:46\
then, by the powerful influence\
of the Holy Ghost, our\
2:50\
current parenting styles, traditions,\
and practices will be sifted,\
2:55\
aligned, refined, and enhanced.\
2:58\
President Russell M. Nelson has taught\
that the home should be\
3:02\
“the center of gospel learning.”\
3:05\
The purpose of gospel learning is\
to “deepen our conversion to\
3:08\
Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and\
help us become more like Them.”\
3:14\
Let's consider three crucial parenting\
responsibilities described by prophets\
3:19\
and apostles that can help us establish\
a higher gospel culture in our homes.\
3:26\
First, teach freely. Heavenly Father\
instructed Adam concerning Jesus Christ\
3:32\
and His doctrine. He taught him “to\
teach these things freely unto [his]\
3:37\
children.” In other words,\
3:39\
Heavenly Father taught Adam to teach\
these things liberally, generously,\
3:45\
and without restraint. The scriptures\
tell us that “Adam and Eve blessed\
3:51\
the name of God, and they made all\
things known unto their sons\
3:57\
and their daughters.” We teach our\
children generously when we spend\
4:02\
meaningful time with them.\
4:04\
We teach without restraint when\
discussing sensitive topics such\
4:08\
as screen time using resources that\
the Church has made available.\
4:13\
We teach liberally when we study\
4:16\
the scriptures with our children\
using “Come, Follow Me” and allow\
4:20\
the Spirit to be the teacher.\
Second, model discipleship.\
4:25\
In the book of John, we read when\
several Jews questioned\
4:29\
the Savior about His conduct, Jesus\
directed attention to His model—\
4:34\
His Father. He taught, “The Son can do\
nothing of himself, but what he seeth\
4:42\
the Father do: for what things soever he\
doeth, these also doeth the Son\
4:48\
likewise.” Parents, what do we need to\
model for our children? Discipleship.\
4:56\
As parents, we can teach the importance\
of putting God first\
5:00\
when we discuss the first commandment,\
5:02\
but we model it when we set aside\
worldly distractions and keep\
5:08\
the Sabbath day holy every week.\
5:10\
We can teach the importance of temple\
covenants when we speak about\
5:15\
the doctrine of celestial marriage,\
5:17\
but we model it when we\
honor our covenants,\
5:21\
treating our spouse with dignity.\
Third, invite to act.\
5:27\
Faith in Jesus Christ should be the core\
of our children's testimonies,\
5:32\
and these testimonies must come to each\
child through individual revelation.\
5:38\
To assist our children with the\
building of their testimonies,\
5:42\
we encourage them to use their agency\
to choose what is right\
5:46\
and prepare them for a lifetime\
on God’s covenant path.\
5:51\
It will be wise to encourage each\
of our children to accept\
5:55\
President Nelson's invitation\
to take charge of his\
5:59\
or her own testimony of Jesus Christ\
and His gospel—to work for it,\
6:04\
to nurture it so that it will grow,\
6:07\
to feed it truth, and to not pollute it\
with false philosophies of unbelieving\
6:13\
men and women. Our Heavenly Father's\
divine intentions as\
6:19\
a parent were made known in a\
revelation given to Moses:\
6:23\
“For behold, this is my work and my\
glory—to bring to pass the immortality\
6:30\
and eternal life of man.” President\
Nelson has added, quote,\
6:35\
“God will do everything He can, short of\
violating your agency, to help you not\
6:43\
miss out on the greatest blessings\
in all eternity.” End of quote.\
6:47\
As parents, we are God's agents\
in the care of our children.\
6:51\
We must do everything we can to create\
6:55\
an environment where our children\
can feel His divine influence.\
7:00\
Heavenly Father never intended for us\
as parents to sit on the sidelines\
7:05\
as spectators, watching the spiritual\
lives of our children unfold.\
7:10\
Let me illustrate this idea of\
intentional parenting with\
7:14\
a personal experience. When\
I was attending Primary in\
7:17\
a small branch in Guatemala,\
7:19\
my parents began to teach me about the\
value of patriarchal blessings.\
7:24\
My mother took the time to share her\
experience receiving her treasured\
7:29\
patriarchal blessing. She taught me\
7:32\
the doctrine related to\
patriarchal blessings,\
7:35\
and she testified of promised blessings.\
7:39\
Her intentional parenting\
inspired me to have\
7:42\
the desire to receive my\
patriarchal blessing.\
7:45\
When I was 12, my parents helped me\
navigate the search for a patriarch.\
7:51\
This was necessary because\
there was no patriarch in\
7:54\
the district where we lived.\
7:56\
I traveled to a patriarch that\
was in a stake 156km\
8:02\
away. I distinctly remember when\
8:05\
the patriarch laid his hands\
upon my head to bless me.\
8:10\
I knew by powerful spiritual\
confirmation\
8:13\
without a doubt that my Heavenly\
Father knew me.\
8:18\
For a 12-year-old boy from a small\
town that meant everything to me.\
8:25\
My heart turned to my Heavenly Father\
that day because of my mother\
8:30\
and father's intentional parenting, and\
I will be forever grateful to them.\
8:35\
Sister Joy D. Jones, former Primary\
General President, taught, quote,\
8:41\
“We cannot wait for conversion to\
simply happen to our children.\
8:46\
Accidental conversion is\
not a principle of\
8:50\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.”\
End of quote.\
8:54\
Our love and inspired\
invitation can make\
8:57\
a difference in how our children\
use their agency.\
9:01\
President Nelson emphasized, quote, “No\
other work transcends that of righteous,\
9:08\
intentional parenting.” End of quote.\
Parents,\
9:12\
this world is full of philosophies,\
9:15\
cultures, and ideas competing for\
our children’s attention.\
9:20\
The great and spacious building\
advertises its membership daily,\
9:25\
using the most current media channels.\
9:28\
“But in the gift of His Son,” the\
Prophet Moroni taught,\
9:33\
“hath God prepared a\
more excellent way.”\
9:37\
As we partner with God through covenants\
and become His agents in\
9:42\
the care of our children, He will\
sanctify our intentions,\
9:45\
inspire our teachings, and\
temper our invitations\
9:49\
so “our children may know\
to what source they\
9:53\
may look for a remission of their sins.”\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
