Today is April 6, the anniversary of\
Jesus Christ restoring His Latter-day\
0:09\
Church and part of the Easter season\
when we joyfully testify of\
0:14\
Jesus Christ’s perfect life, atoning\
sacrifice, and glorious Resurrection.\
0:22\
A Chinese story begins as a man's\
son finds a beautiful horse.\
0:28\
How fortunate, the neighbors say.\
We’ll see, says the man.\
0:34\
Then the son falls off the horse\
and is permanently injured.\
0:37\
How unfortunate, the neighbors say.\
We'll see, says the man.\
0:44\
A conscripting army comes, but\
doesn't take the injured son.\
0:48\
How fortunate, the neighbors say.\
We'll see, says the man.\
0:55\
This fickle world often feels tempest-\
tossed, uncertain, sometimes fortunate,\
1:01\
and too often unfortunate.\
1:04\
Yet in this world of tribulation,\
1:07\
we know that all things work together\
for good to them that love God.\
1:13\
Indeed, as we walk uprightly\
and remember our covenants,\
1:17\
all things shall work together for your\
good. All things for our good;\
1:26\
a remarkable promise, comforting\
assurance from God Himself in\
1:32\
a miraculous way. The purpose\
of creation and\
1:35\
the nature of God is to know\
beginning and end,\
1:39\
to bring about all that is for our good,\
1:43\
and to help us become sanctified\
and holy through Jesus Christ’s\
1:47\
grace and Atonement. Jesus Christ’s\
1:50\
Atonement can deliver and\
redeem us from sin.\
1:53\
But Jesus Christ also intimately\
understands our every pain, affliction,\
2:00\
sickness, sorrow, separation.\
In time and eternity,\
2:05\
His triumph over death and hell\
can make all things right.\
2:11\
He helps heal the broken and disparaged,\
2:14\
reconcile the angry and divided, comfort\
the lonely and isolated,\
2:19\
encourage the uncertain and imperfect,\
2:22\
and bring forth miracles\
possible only with God.\
2:27\
We sing hallelujah and shout hosanna\
with the eternal power\
2:32\
and infinite goodness in God's\
plan of happiness.\
2:37\
All things can work together\
for your good.\
2:41\
We can face life with confidence\
and not fear. Left on our own,\
2:48\
we may not know our own\
good. When I choose me,\
2:53\
I'm also choosing my own limitations,\
weaknesses, inadequacies.\
2:58\
Ultimately, to do the most good, we\
must be good. Since none save\
3:04\
God is good, we seek perfection\
in Jesus Christ.\
3:09\
We become our truest, best selves only\
as we put off the natural man or woman\
3:14\
and become a child before God.\
With trust and faith in God,\
3:20\
trials and afflictions can be\
consecrated for our good.\
3:24\
Joseph, sold into Egypt in slavery,\
later saved his family and people.\
3:30\
The Prophet Joseph Smith's\
incarceration\
3:33\
in liberty jail taught him “these things\
shall give thee experience,\
3:37\
and shall be for thy good.”\
Lived with faith,\
3:41\
trials and sacrifices we would\
never choose can bless us\
3:46\
and others in ways never imagined.\
3:50\
We increase faith and trust in the Lord\
3:52\
that all things can work\
together for our good\
3:55\
as we gain eternal perspective;\
3:59\
understand our trials may be\
4:01\
“but for a small moment”; recognize\
affliction can be consecrated\
4:05\
for our day; acknowledge accidents,\
untimely death,\
4:10\
debilitating illness, and disease are\
part of mortality; and trust\
4:15\
loving Heavenly Father does not give\
trials to punish or judge.\
4:21\
He would not give a stone to\
someone asking for bread,\
4:24\
nor a serpent to one asking for a fish.\
4:28\
When trials come, often what we most\
want is for someone to listen\
4:34\
and be with us. In the moment,\
4:37\
cliché answers can be unhelpful, however\
comforting their intent.\
4:42\
Sometimes we yearn for someone who will\
grieve, ache, and weep with us.\
4:48\
Let us express pain, frustration,\
sometimes even anger,\
4:53\
and acknowledge with us there\
are things we do not know.\
4:58\
When we trust God and His love for us,\
5:02\
even our greatest heartbreaks can, in\
the end, work together for our good.\
5:08\
I remember the day I received word of\
5:11\
a serious car accident which\
involved those I love.\
5:15\
At such times, in anguish and faith, we\
can only say with Job, The Lord gave,\
5:24\
and the Lord hath taken away. Blessed\
be the name of the Lord.\
5:30\
Across the worldwide Church,\
5:31\
some 3,500 stakes and districts\
and some 30,000\
5:36\
wards and branches provide\
refuge and safety.\
5:40\
But within our stakes and wards,\
5:42\
many faithful families and individuals\
confront difficult challenges,\
5:48\
even while knowing that without\
yet knowing how,\
5:53\
things will work together for our good.\
5:58\
In Huddersfield, England,\
6:00\
brother Samuel Bridgstock was diagnosed\
with stage four cancer shortly before\
6:06\
the calling of a new stake president.\
6:08\
Given his dire diagnosis,\
6:10\
he asked his wife Anna why he would\
even go to be interviewed.\
6:16\
Because, Sister Bridgstock said, you’re\
going to be called as stake president.\
6:22\
Initially given a year or two to live,\
President Bridgstock,\
6:27\
who is here today, is now in\
his fourth year of service.\
6:32\
He has good and hard days.\
6:36\
His stake is rallying with increased\
faith, service, and kindness.\
6:40\
It is not easy. But his wife\
and family live with faith,\
6:46\
gratitude, and understandable sadness\
6:50\
they trust will become eternal joy\
through Jesus Christ’s restoring\
6:55\
Atonement. When we are still, open, and\
reverent, we may feel the beauty,\
7:02\
purpose, and serenity of\
the covenant belonging\
7:05\
the Lord offers. In sacred moments,\
He may let us glimpse the larger,\
7:11\
eternal reality of which our\
daily lives are part,\
7:15\
where small and simple things work\
together for the good of givers\
7:20\
and receivers. Rebecca, the daughter\
of my first mission president,\
7:26\
shared how the Lord answered\
her prayer for comfort with\
7:31\
an unexpected opportunity to answer\
someone else's prayer.\
7:36\
Late one evening, Rebecca, grieving\
her mother's recent passing,\
7:41\
had a clear impression to\
go buy gas for her car.\
7:45\
When she arrived at the station,\
7:47\
she met an elderly woman struggling to\
breathe with a large oxygen tank.\
7:52\
Later, Rebecca was able to give\
7:54\
the woman her mother's portable\
oxygen machine.\
7:58\
This sister gratefully said, You’ve\
given me back my freedom.\
8:05\
Things work together for good when we\
minister as Jesus Christ would.\
8:11\
A father assigned with his teenage son\
as ministering companions explained,\
8:16\
Ministering is when we go from being\
neighbors who bring cookies to trusted\
8:22\
friends, spiritual first responders.\
Covenant belonging in Jesus Christ\
8:29\
comforts, connects, consecrates.\
8:33\
Even in tragedy, spiritual preparation\
may remind us Heavenly Father knew\
8:39\
when we felt most vulnerable and alone.\
8:43\
For example, a family whose\
child was taken to\
8:46\
the hospital later found\
comfort in remembering\
8:50\
the Holy Ghost had whispered\
in advance what to expect.\
8:56\
Sometimes the larger eternal reality\
8:59\
the Lord lets us feel includes\
family across the veil.\
9:03\
A sister found joy in conversion to\
Jesus Christ’s restored gospel,\
9:08\
yet two traumas had deeply\
impacted her life:\
9:13\
seeing a boating accident\
9:15\
and tragically losing her mother,\
who had taken her own life.\
9:20\
Yet this sister overcame her fear of\
water enough to be baptized by\
9:26\
immersion. And on what became\
a very happy day,\
9:30\
she witnessed someone acting as proxy\
9:33\
for her deceased mother be\
baptized in the temple.\
9:38\
Temple baptism healed my mother and\
it freed me, the sister said.\
9:45\
It was the first time I felt peace\
since my mother passed away.\
9:52\
Our sacred music echoes His assurance\
that all things can work together\
9:58\
for our good. Be still, my soul. Thy God\
doth undertake to guide the future\
10:06\
as He has the past. Thy hope, thy\
confidence let nothing shake.\
10:12\
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.\
10:17\
Come, come, ye saints, no\
toil nor labor fear.\
10:21\
But with joy wend your way. Though hard\
to you this journey may appear,\
10:28\
grace shall be as your day. And should\
we die before our journey’s through,\
10:35\
happy day, all is well. The Book of\
Mormon is evidence we can hold in our\
10:43\
hand that Jesus is the Christ,\
10:47\
and God fulfills His prophecies. Written\
by inspired prophets who saw our day,\
10:54\
the Book of Mormon begins\
with raw drama,\
10:58\
a family dealing with deep differences.\
11:01\
Yet as we study and ponder 1 Nephi\
chapter one through to Moroni chapter\
11:07\
ten, we're drawn to Jesus Christ with\
11:11\
a firm testimony that what happened\
there and then can bless us here\
11:17\
and now.\
11:20\
As the Lord, through His living prophet,\
11:22\
brings more houses of the Lord\
closer in more places,\
11:27\
temple blessings work together\
for our good.\
11:31\
We come by covenant and ordinance\
to God our Father\
11:34\
and Jesus Christ and gain eternal\
perspective on mortality.\
11:38\
Performed one-by-one, name-by-name,\
11:41\
we offer beloved family members,\
ancestors,\
11:45\
sacred ordinances and covenant\
blessings and\
11:49\
the Lord's pattern of saviors\
on Mount Zion.\
11:53\
As temples come closer\
to us in many places,\
11:55\
a temple sacrifice we can offer is\
to seek holiness in the house of\
12:00\
the Lord more frequently.\
12:02\
For many years we have saved, planned,\
and sacrificed to come to the temple.\
12:07\
Now, as circumstances permit,\
12:09\
come even more often to the\
Lord in His holy house.\
12:14\
Let regular temple worship\
and service bless,\
12:18\
protect, and inspire you and your family,\
12:21\
the family you have, or the family you\
will have and become someday.\
12:28\
Also, where your circumstances permit,\
12:31\
please consider the blessing of owning\
your own temple clothes.\
12:36\
A grandmother from a humble\
family said of anything in\
12:39\
the world what she most wanted\
were her own temple clothes.\
12:44\
Her grandson said, Grandma whispered, I\
will serve in my own temple clothes,\
12:51\
and after I pass away, I\
will be buried in them.\
12:56\
And when the time came, she was.\
13:00\
As President Russell M. Nelson\
teaches, Everything\
13:04\
we believe and every promise\
God has made to His covenant\
13:08\
people come together in the temple.\
In time and eternity,\
13:13\
the purpose of creation and\
13:16\
the nature of God Himself are to bring\
all things together for our good.\
13:22\
This is the Lord’s eternal purpose.\
It is His eternal perspective.\
13:28\
It is His eternal promise. When life is\
cluttered and purpose isn’t clear,\
13:36\
When you want to live better\
but don't know how,\
13:40\
please come to God our Father\
and Jesus Christ.\
13:43\
Trust they live, love you, and want\
all things for your good.\
13:49\
I testify they do infinitely\
and eternally in the sacred\
13:55\
and holy name of Jesus Christ,\
13:58\
amen.\
