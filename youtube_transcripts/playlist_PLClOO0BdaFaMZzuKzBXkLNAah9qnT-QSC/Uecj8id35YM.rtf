As Lesa and I\
0:01\
travel on assignment throughout\
the world,\
0:03\
we relish the privilege of meeting you\
in congregations large and small.\
0:08\
Your devotion to the work of the\
Lord buoys us up and stands as\
0:12\
a testimony to the gospel\
of Jesus Christ.\
0:15\
We return home from each trip wondering\
if we possibly gave as much\
0:19\
as we received. When traveling, there\
is little time for sightseeing.\
0:24\
However, when possible, I spend a few\
moments in a particular passion.\
0:28\
I have an interest in architecture\
and design with\
0:31\
a special fascination with bridges.\
Suspension bridges amaze me.\
0:37\
Whether it’s the Rainbow Bridge in\
Tokyo, the Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong,\
0:44\
the Tower Bridge in London,\
or others I have seen,\
0:46\
I marvel at the engineering genius\
behind these complicated structures.\
0:53\
Bridges take us places otherwise\
we would not be able to go.\
0:57\
Now, before I continue, I note that\
since this message was prepared,\
1:01\
a tragic bridge accident\
occurred in Baltimore,\
1:05\
and we mourn the loss of life\
1:07\
and offer condolences to those\
affected families.\
1:12\
Recently, a conference assignment\
took me to California,\
1:16\
where I once again crossed the\
iconic Golden Gate Bridge.\
1:20\
Regarded as an engineering\
wonder of the world,\
1:23\
this monumental structure intertwines\
beautiful form, functional purpose,\
1:28\
and masterful engineering.\
1:30\
It is a classical suspension bridge\
with bookend towers supported by\
1:35\
massive piers. The colossal, majestic,\
1:39\
weight-bearing twin towers soaring\
above the ocean were\
1:42\
the first elements to be constructed.\
1:45\
Together, they shoulder the load of the\
sweeping main suspension cables and\
1:49\
the vertical suspender cables which\
cradle the roadway below.\
1:54\
The extraordinary stabilizing capacity,\
1:57\
the power of the tower, is the magic\
behind the engineering of the bridge.\
2:02\
Early construction images of\
2:03\
the bridge bear testimony of\
this engineering principle.\
2:07\
Each bridge element finds weight-\
bearing support from\
2:11\
the symmetrical towers. Both\
interdependently connected one to\
2:18\
another. When the bridge is complete\
with its two powerful towers firmly in\
2:23\
place and piers anchored in\
the foundation of bedrock,\
2:27\
it is an image of strength and beauty.\
2:31\
Today, I invite you to look\
at this stately bridge,\
2:34\
with its ascending twin towers\
2:36\
built on a strong foundation,\
through a gospel lens. In\
2:42\
the twilight of Jesus Christ’s ministry\
during what we now call Holy Week,\
2:47\
a pharisee who was a lawyer\
asked the Savior\
2:50\
a question he knew was nearly\
impossible to answer:\
2:54\
“Master, what is the great\
commandment in the law?”\
2:57\
The lawyer, “tempting him” and seeking\
3:00\
a legalistic answer with seemingly\
deceitful intent,\
3:05\
received a genuine sacred\
divine response.\
3:09\
“Jesus said unto him, thou shalt love\
the Lord thy God with all thy heart,\
3:14\
and with all thy soul, and\
with all thy mind. This\
3:17\
is the first and great commandment.”\
Hearkening to our bridge analogy,\
3:22\
the first tower. “And the second\
is like unto it, thou\
3:25\
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”\
This is the second tower.\
3:30\
“On these two commandments hang\
all the law and the prophets.”\
3:34\
The remaining elements of the bridge.\
3:37\
Let's examine each of the two\
great commandments revealed\
3:41\
and recited in Jesus Christ's response.\
3:44\
As we do so, let the image of\
3:46\
the majestic suspension bridge\
resonate in your mind's eye.\
3:51\
The first: to love the Lord with all\
your heart, soul, and mind.\
3:56\
In this answer, Jesus Christ condenses\
the essence of the law\
4:00\
embodied in the sacred teachings\
of the Old Testament.\
4:04\
To love the Lord centers first on\
your heart—your very nature.\
4:09\
The Lord asks you to love with all your\
soul—your entire consecrated being—\
4:15\
and to love with all your mind—your\
intelligence and intellect.\
4:20\
Love for God is not limited or finite.\
It is infinite and eternal.\
4:26\
For me, the application of\
4:28\
the first great commandment can\
sometimes feel abstract\
4:32\
or even daunting. Gratefully, as I\
consider further words of Jesus,\
4:38\
this commandment becomes more graspable:\
“If ye love me, keep my commandments.”\
4:44\
This I can do. I can love Heavenly\
Father and Jesus Christ,\
4:48\
which leads to prayer, scripture study,\
and temple worship.\
4:52\
We love the Father and the Son through\
the payment of tithes,\
4:56\
keeping the Sabbath day holy, living\
a virtuous and chaste life, and\
5:00\
being obedient. Love is often measured\
in small daily deeds,\
5:05\
footsteps on the covenant\
path. For young people,\
5:08\
using social media to build up rather\
than tear down; leaving the party,\
5:14\
movie, or activity where standards\
might be challenged;\
5:18\
showing reverence for things sacred.\
Consider this tender example.\
5:24\
It was fast Sunday as Vance and I\
knocked on the door of a small,\
5:29\
humble home. We and other deacons\
in the quorum had come to expect\
5:33\
the words “Please come in,”\
5:36\
yelled warmly in a thick German accent\
loud enough to hear through the door.\
5:43\
Sister Mueller was one of several\
immigrant widows in the ward.\
5:47\
She couldn't answer the door very\
easily as she was legally blind.\
5:52\
Stepping inside the dimly lit home, she\
greeted us with kind questions.\
5:58\
“What are your names?” “How are you\
doing?” “Do you love the Lord?”\
6:03\
We answered and shared that we had come\
to receive her fast offering.\
6:09\
Even at our young age, her meager\
circumstances were readily apparent\
6:15\
and her faith-filled response\
was profoundly touching:\
6:20\
“I placed a dime on the counter\
earlier this morning.\
6:24\
I am so grateful to offer\
my fast offering.\
6:27\
Would you be kind enough to\
place it in the envelope\
6:30\
and fill out my fast offering receipt?”\
6:34\
Her love of the Lord lifted our faith\
each time we left her home.\
6:41\
King Benjamin promised remarkable\
power for those who follow\
6:45\
the first great commandment.\
6:47\
“I would desire that ye should\
consider on the blessed\
6:50\
and happy state of those that\
keep the commandments. ...\
6:53\
They are blessed in all things, ... and\
if they hold out to the end\
6:57\
they are received into heaven ... in a\
state of never-ending happiness.”\
7:03\
Loving the Lord leads to\
eternal happiness.\
7:08\
Jesus then said, “And the\
second is like unto it,\
7:12\
thou shalt love thy\
neighbor as thyself.”\
7:15\
This is the second tower of the bridge.\
7:18\
Here, Jesus bridges our heavenly\
upward gaze to love\
7:23\
the Lord with our earthly outward gaze\
to love our fellow men.\
7:27\
One is interdependent on the other.\
Love of the Lord is not complete\
7:32\
if we neglect our neighbors.\
7:35\
This outward love includes all of God's\
children without regard to gender,\
7:39\
social class, race, sexuality, income,\
age, or ethnicity.\
7:45\
We seek out those who\
are hurt and broken,\
7:49\
the marginalized, for “all\
are like unto God.”\
7:53\
We “succor the weak, lift up\
the hands which hang\
7:56\
down,\
7:57\
and strengthen the feeble knees.”\
Consider this example.\
8:02\
Brother Evans was surprised when\
he was prompted to stop his car\
8:07\
and knock on an unknown door\
of an unknown family.\
8:12\
When a widowed mother of over\
10 answered the door,\
8:16\
their difficult circumstances\
8:18\
and great needs became readily apparent\
to him. The first was simple:\
8:24\
paint for their home, which was followed\
by many years of temporal\
8:30\
and spiritual ministering\
to this family.\
8:33\
This thankful mother later wrote\
of her heaven-sent friend,\
8:39\
“You have spent your life reaching\
out to the least of us.\
8:42\
How I would love to hear the things\
the Lord has to say to you,\
8:47\
as He expresses His appreciation for\
the good you have done financially\
8:51\
and spiritually for the people that only\
you and He will ever know about.\
8:56\
Thank you for blessing\
us in so many ways, ... for\
8:59\
the missionaries you provided for. ...\
9:02\
I often wonder if the Lord picked\
on you exclusively,\
9:06\
or if you were just the\
one who listened.”\
9:11\
To love your neighbor includes\
Christlike deeds of kindness and\
9:15\
service. Can you let go of grudges,\
forgive enemies,\
9:19\
welcome and minister to your neighbors,\
and assist the elderly?\
9:23\
You'll each be inspired as you build\
your tower of love for neighbor.\
9:29\
President Russell M. Nelson taught:\
“Giving help to others—\
9:33\
making a conscientious effort to\
care about others as much as\
9:38\
or more than we care about\
ourselves—is our joy.\
9:43\
Especially ... when it is not convenient\
9:45\
and when it takes us out\
of our comfort zone.\
9:48\
Living that great second commandment\
is the key to becoming\
9:52\
a true disciple of Jesus Christ.”\
9:56\
Jesus further taught, “On these two\
commandments hang all the law and\
10:00\
the prophets.” This is very instructive.\
10:03\
There is an important interdependency\
between loving the Lord\
10:08\
and loving one another. For\
10:10\
the Golden Gate Bridge to perform\
its design function,\
10:14\
both towers are equally strong and with\
equal power bear the weight of\
10:19\
the suspension cables, the roadway, and\
the traffic crossing the bridge.\
10:25\
Without this engineering symmetry,\
the bridge could be compromised,\
10:30\
even leading to collapse.\
10:32\
For any suspension bridge to\
do what it was built to do,\
10:36\
its towers must function together\
in complete harmony.\
10:41\
Likewise, our ability to follow Jesus\
Christ depends upon our strength\
10:47\
and power to live the first and second\
commandments with balance\
10:52\
and equal devotion to both.\
10:55\
The increasing contention in the\
world suggests, however,\
10:58\
that we at times fail to\
see or remember this.\
11:02\
Some are so focused on keeping\
11:04\
the commandments that they show little\
tolerance of those they see\
11:09\
as less righteous. Some find it\
difficult to love those who are\
11:13\
choosing their lives outside\
of the covenant,\
11:15\
or even away from any religious\
participation.\
11:20\
Alternatively, there are\
those who emphasize\
11:23\
the importance of loving others without\
acknowledgment that we are all\
11:27\
accountable to God. Some\
refuse entirely to\
11:30\
the notion that there is such a thing as\
absolute truth or right and wrong,\
11:35\
and that the only thing required\
of us is complete tolerance\
11:38\
and acceptance of the choices of others.\
11:42\
Either of these imbalances could cause\
your spiritual bridge to tip\
11:47\
or even fall. President Dallin H. Oaks\
11:51\
described this when he said, “We\
are commanded to love everyone,\
11:56\
since Jesus’s parable of the good\
Samaritan teaches that everyone is our\
12:00\
neighbor. But our zeal to keep\
12:03\
the second commandment must not\
cause us to forget the first,\
12:07\
to love God with all our heart, soul,\
and mind.”\
12:13\
So the question for each of us is this:\
How do we build our own bridge of faith\
12:19\
and devotion—erecting tall bridge\
towers of both loving God\
12:24\
and loving our neighbors? Well,\
we just start.\
12:29\
Our initial efforts might look like the\
plan on the back of a napkin or\
12:33\
an early stage blueprint of the\
bridge we hope to construct.\
12:37\
It might consist of a few realistic\
goals to understand the Lord’s gospel,\
12:42\
the Lord’s gospel more, or to\
vow to judge others less.\
12:47\
No one is too young or too old to begin.\
12:50\
Over time, with prayerful\
and thoughtful planning,\
12:55\
rough ideas are refined, new\
actions become habits,\
13:01\
early drafts become polished blueprints.\
13:06\
We build our personal spiritual\
bridge with hearts\
13:09\
and minds devoted to Heavenly Father\
and His Only Begotten Son,\
13:14\
as well as to our brothers and sisters\
with whom we work, play, and live.\
13:20\
So in the days ahead,\
13:23\
when you pass over\
a majestic suspension bridge,\
13:27\
or even when you see a picture,\
with its soaring towers,\
13:31\
I invite you to remember the two great\
commandments described by Jesus Christ\
13:36\
in the New Testament. May the Lord's\
instructions inspire us.\
13:41\
May our hearts and minds\
be lifted upward to\
13:44\
love the Lord and turned outward\
to love our neighbor.\
13:49\
May this strengthen our faith in\
Jesus Christ and His Atonement,\
13:54\
of which I testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
