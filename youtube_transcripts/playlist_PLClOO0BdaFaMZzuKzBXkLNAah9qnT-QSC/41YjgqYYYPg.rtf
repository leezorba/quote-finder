I have felt deeply about the Atonement of\
Jesus Christ since I was quite young.\
0:07\
But the reality of the Savior's\
Atonement came home to me when I was 25.\
0:13\
I had just graduated from Stanford\
Law School and was studying for\
0:16\
the California bar exam. My mother\
called and said that my grandfather,\
0:22\
Crosier Kimball, who lived\
in Utah, was dying.\
0:26\
She said if I wanted to see him,\
I had better come home.\
0:31\
My grandfather was 86 and very ill.\
I had a wonderful visit.\
0:36\
He was so pleased to see me and\
share his testimony with me.\
0:42\
When Crosier was just three years old,\
his father, David Patton Kimball,\
0:47\
died at age 44. Crosier\
hoped that his father\
0:52\
and his grandfather, Heber C. Kimball,\
0:55\
would approve of his life and feel\
he had been true to his heritage.\
1:01\
My grandfather's primary counsel to me\
was to avoid any sense of entitlement\
1:08\
or privilege because of these\
faithful ancestors.\
1:12\
He told me my focus should be on the\
Savior and the Savior's Atonement.\
1:18\
He said, we are all children of\
a loving Heavenly Father.\
1:23\
Regardless of who our earthly\
ancestors are,\
1:27\
each of us will report to the\
Savior on how well\
1:32\
we kept His commandments.\
1:34\
Grandpa referred to the Savior\
as the keeper of the gate,\
1:37\
a reference to 2 Nephi 9:41.\
1:40\
He told me he hoped he had been\
sufficiently repentant to qualify\
1:44\
for the Savior's mercy.\
I was deeply touched.\
1:48\
I knew he had been a righteous man.\
1:50\
He was a patriarch and served\
several missions.\
1:53\
He taught me that no one can turn\
to God by good works alone\
1:58\
without the benefit of the\
Savior's Atonement.\
2:02\
I can remember this day the great love\
and appreciation Grandpa had for\
2:07\
the Savior and His Atonement.\
2:10\
In 2019, during an assignment in\
Jerusalem, I visited an upper room,\
2:16\
which may have been near the site where\
2:18\
the Savior washed His Apostles’ feet\
prior to His crucifixion.\
2:24\
I was spiritually touched\
2:26\
and thought of how He commanded His\
Apostles to love one another.\
2:31\
I recalled the Savior's pleading\
intercessory prayer in our behalf.\
2:35\
This prayer occurred in literally the\
closing hours of His mortal life,\
2:40\
as recorded in the Gospel of John.\
2:43\
This prayer was directed to followers\
of Christ, including all of us.\
2:49\
In the Savior’s petition to His Father,\
He pleaded, quote,\
2:54\
That they may be one as thou, Father,\
art in me, and I in thee,\
3:00\
that they also may be one in us.\
3:04\
The Savior then continues,\
3:05\
And the glory which thou gavest me I\
have given them, that they may be one,\
3:12\
even as we are one. Oneness is what\
Christ prayed for prior to His betrayal\
3:20\
and crucifixion. Oneness with Christ\
3:23\
and our Heavenly Father can be obtained\
through the Savior's Atonement.\
3:28\
The Lord's saving mercy is not dependent\
on lineage, education,\
3:32\
economic status, or race.\
3:35\
It is based on being one with\
Christ and His commandments.\
3:40\
The Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver\
Cowdery received the revelation\
3:44\
on Church organization and\
government in 1830,\
3:48\
soon after the Church was organized.\
3:50\
What is now section 20 was read\
by the Prophet Joseph at\
3:55\
the first Church conference,\
3:57\
and was the first revelation\
approved by common consent.\
4:01\
The content of this revelation\
is truly remarkable.\
4:05\
It teaches us the significance\
and role of the Savior\
4:09\
and how to access His power and\
blessings through His atoning grace.\
4:15\
The Prophet Joseph was 24 years old\
4:18\
and had already received\
numerous revelations,\
4:21\
and completed the translation of\
the Book of Mormon by the gift\
4:26\
and power of God. Both Joseph\
and Oliver are identified\
4:31\
as ordained Apostles, thus having\
authority to preside over the Church.\
4:38\
Verses 17 through 36 contain a summary\
of essential Church doctrine,\
4:45\
including the reality of God,\
the creation of mankind,\
4:49\
the Fall, and Heavenly Father’s\
plan of salvation through\
4:53\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Verse\
37 contains the essential\
4:59\
requirements for baptism\
into the Lord’s Church.\
5:03\
Verses 75 through 79 set forth\
5:07\
the sacrament prayers we\
utilize every Sabbath.\
5:12\
The doctrine, principles, sacrament,\
5:15\
and practices that the Lord established\
through Joseph Smith,\
5:19\
the Prophet of the Restoration,\
are truly seminal.\
5:23\
The requirements for baptism, while\
profound, are uniquely simple.\
5:28\
They primarily include\
humility before God,\
5:32\
a broken heart and contrite spirit,\
repenting of all sins,\
5:38\
taking upon us the name of Jesus Christ,\
5:41\
enduring to the end, and showing by our\
works that we have received of\
5:47\
the Spirit of Christ. It is significant\
that all the qualifications\
5:53\
for baptism are spiritual. No economic\
or social attainment is necessary.\
6:00\
The poor and the rich have the\
same spiritual requirements.\
6:04\
There are no race, gender, or\
ethnicity requirements.\
6:09\
The Book of Mormon makes it clear that\
all are invited to partake of\
6:14\
the Lord’s goodness: black and white,\
bond and free, male and female,\
6:20\
all are alike unto God. The Lord\
declared, All men are privileged,\
6:27\
the one like unto the other,\
and none are forbidden.\
6:31\
Given our likeness before God,\
6:34\
it makes little sense to emphasize\
our differences.\
6:38\
Some have wrongly encouraged us to\
imagine people to be much more\
6:43\
different from ourselves and from each\
other than they actually are.\
6:48\
Some take real but small differences\
and magnify them into chasms.\
6:54\
In addition, some have\
wrongly assumed that\
6:56\
because all people are invited to\
receive His goodness and eternal life,\
7:01\
there are no conduct requirements.\
7:04\
However, the scriptures attest that all\
accountable persons are required to\
7:10\
repent of sins and keep\
His commandments.\
7:13\
The Lord makes it clear that\
all have moral agency\
7:17\
and are free to choose liberty\
and eternal life through\
7:21\
the great Mediator of all men, and\
hearken unto His great commandments,\
7:26\
and be faithful unto His words,\
7:28\
and choose eternal life. To receive the\
blessings of the Savior’s Atonement,\
7:34\
we must affirmatively exercise our\
moral agency to choose Christ\
7:41\
and obey His commandments.\
7:44\
During my life, the meaning of agency\
and free will has been dissected\
7:49\
and debated. There have been\
7:52\
and continue to be many intellectual\
arguments on these topics.\
7:57\
On the recent cover of a major\
university alumni publication,\
8:01\
a prominent biologist\
professor asserts there is no room\
8:07\
for free will. Not surprisingly,\
8:11\
the professor is quoted in\
the article as saying,\
8:13\
“There’s no such thing as God\
and there’s no free will,\
8:17\
and this is a vast, indifferent,\
empty universe.” End quote.\
8:24\
I could not disagree more strongly.\
8:27\
A fundamental doctrine of our faith\
is that we do have moral agency,\
8:31\
which includes free will. Agency is\
the ability to choose and act.\
8:37\
It is essential to the\
plan of salvation.\
8:40\
Without moral agency,\
we could not learn,\
8:44\
progress, or choose to\
be one with Christ.\
8:48\
Because of moral agency, we are free\
to choose liberty and eternal life.\
8:53\
In the Premortal Council in Heaven,\
8:56\
the Father’s plan included agency\
as an essential element.\
9:01\
Lucifer rebelled and sought to\
destroy the agency of man.\
9:05\
Accordingly, the privilege of having\
a mortal body was denied to Satan\
9:09\
and those who followed him.\
9:12\
Other premortal spirits exercised\
their agency in following\
9:16\
Heavenly Father's plan. Spirits blessed\
by birth to this mortal life continue\
9:23\
to have agency. We are free\
to choose and act,\
9:27\
but we do not control the consequences.\
9:30\
Choices of good and righteousness lead\
to happiness, peace, and eternal life,\
9:36\
while choices of sin and evil\
eventually lead to heartache\
9:42\
and misery. As Alma said,\
9:44\
wickedness never was happiness. In this\
extremely competitive world,\
9:50\
there is a constant effort to excel.\
9:53\
Striving to be the best we can be is a\
righteous and worthwhile endeavor.\
9:59\
It is consistent with\
the Lord’s doctrine.\
10:02\
Efforts to diminish or deprecate others\
10:06\
or create barriers to their success\
is contrary to the Lord’s doctrine.\
10:13\
We cannot blame circumstances\
or others for\
10:15\
a decision to act contrary\
to God's commandments.\
10:20\
In today’s world, it is easy to\
focus on material\
10:24\
and occupational success.\
10:26\
Some lose sight of eternal\
10:28\
principles and choices that\
have eternal significance.\
10:33\
We would be wise to follow President\
Russell M. Nelson’s counsel to\
10:38\
“think celestial.” The most significant\
choices can be made by almost everyone,\
10:45\
regardless of talents, abilities,\
opportunities, or economic circumstances.\
10:51\
An emphasis on putting family\
choices first is essential.\
10:56\
This is clear throughout the scriptures.\
10:58\
Think of the account in Nephi where\
Lehi departed into the wilderness,\
11:04\
and he left his house and the land\
of his inheritance, and his gold,\
11:09\
and his silver, and his precious things,\
and took nothing with him,\
11:14\
save it were his family. As we face\
the vicissitudes of life,\
11:19\
many events occur over which we\
have little or no control.\
11:24\
Health challenges and accidents\
obviously can fit into this category.\
11:29\
The recent COVID-19 pandemic has\
severely impacted people who did\
11:35\
everything right. For the most important\
choices, we do have control.\
11:42\
Going back to my missionary days, Elder\
Marion D. Hanks, our mission president,\
11:47\
had all of us memorize part of\
a poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox.\
11:53\
There is no chance, no destiny,\
11:55\
no fate that can circumvent or hinder\
or control the firm resolve of\
12:03\
a determined soul. On matters\
of principle, conduct,\
12:07\
religious observance, and righteous\
living, we are in control.\
12:13\
Our faith in and worship of God the\
Father and His Son, Jesus Christ,\
12:18\
is a choice that we make.\
12:21\
Please understand, I am not advocating\
less interest in education\
12:25\
or occupation. What I am saying is that\
when efforts relating to education\
12:30\
and occupation are elevated above the\
family or being one with Christ,\
12:36\
the unintended consequences can\
be significantly adverse.\
12:41\
The clear and simple doctrine\
set forth in Doctrine\
12:44\
and Covenants 20 is touching and\
compelling as it amplifies\
12:51\
and clarifies sacred spiritual concepts.\
12:55\
It teaches that salvation comes\
as Jesus Christ justifies\
13:00\
and sanctifies repentant souls because\
of the Savior's grace.\
13:06\
It sets the stage for the preeminent\
role of His Atonement.\
13:12\
We should strive to include others in\
our circle of oneness. If we are to\
13:17\
follow President Russell M. Nelson’s\
admonition to gather scattered Israel\
13:22\
on both sides of the veil,\
13:24\
we need to include others in\
our circle of oneness.\
13:28\
As President Nelson has\
so beautifully taught,\
13:32\
on every continent and across\
the aisles of the sea,\
13:35\
faithful people are being gathered into\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
13:40\
Saints. Differences in culture,\
language, gender, race,\
13:46\
and nationality fade into insignificance\
as the faithful enter\
13:52\
the covenant path and come unto our\
beloved Redeemer. End quote.\
13:58\
We are united by our love of\
and faith in Jesus Christ,\
14:04\
and as children of a loving\
Heavenly Father,\
14:08\
the essence of truly belonging\
is to be one with Christ.\
14:15\
The ordinances of baptism and the\
sacrament set forth in Doctrine\
14:20\
and Covenants 20, together with\
our temple covenants,\
14:24\
unite us in special ways and allow\
us to be one in every eternally\
14:31\
significant way and to live\
in peace and harmony.\
14:36\
I bear my sure and certain witness\
that Jesus Christ lives,\
14:41\
and because of His Atonement,\
we can be one with Christ.\
14:47\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
