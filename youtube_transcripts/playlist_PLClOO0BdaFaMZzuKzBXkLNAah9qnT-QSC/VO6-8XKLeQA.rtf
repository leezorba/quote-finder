As a young boy, I loved fresh,\
ripe peaches.\
0:04\
To this day, the idea of\
biting into a juicy,\
0:07\
ripe peach with its tangy flavor\
makes my mouth water. When fully\
0:12\
matured peaches are picked, they\
last two to four days before they spoil.\
0:18\
I have fond memories of joining with my\
mother and my siblings in our kitchen\
0:23\
as we would preserve harvested\
peaches for\
0:26\
the coming winter by sealing\
them in bottles.\
0:29\
If we preserved the peaches correctly,\
0:32\
this delicious fruit would last several\
years, not just two to four days.\
0:37\
For peaches, if properly\
prepared and heated,\
0:40\
the fruit is preserved until\
the seal is broken.\
0:44\
Christ directed us to “go and bring\
forth fruit, ... that your fruit should\
0:48\
remain.” But He wasn’t speaking\
about peaches.\
0:52\
He was talking about God’s blessings\
to His children.\
0:56\
If we make and keep covenants with God,\
0:59\
the blessings associated with our\
covenants can extend beyond this life\
1:03\
and be sealed upon us or\
preserved forever,\
1:06\
becoming fruit that remains\
for all eternity.\
1:10\
The Holy Ghost, in His divine role\
as the Holy Spirit of Promise,\
1:14\
will seal each ordinance upon those who\
are faithful to their covenants\
1:19\
so that they will be valid\
after mortality.\
1:23\
Having the Holy Ghost seal our\
ordinances is essential if we want to\
1:27\
have the promised blessings for all\
eternity, becoming fruit that remains.\
1:33\
This is particularly important\
if we want to be exalted.\
1:37\
As President Nelson has taught, quote,\
“We should begin with the end in mind.\
1:42\
Surely for each of us, the ‘end’ we\
would most like to achieve is to live\
1:48\
forever with our families in an exalted\
state where we will be in the\
1:52\
presence of God, our Heavenly Father,\
and His Son, Jesus Christ.”\
1:57\
End of quote. President Nelson has\
also said, “Celestial marriage is\
2:02\
a pivotal part of preparation\
for eternal life.\
2:07\
It requires one to be married\
2:10\
to the right person, in the\
right place, by the right authority,\
2:16\
and to obey that sacred\
covenant faithfully.\
2:20\
Then one may be assured of exaltation\
in the celestial kingdom of God.”\
2:25\
What are the blessings of exaltation?\
2:28\
They include dwelling in God's presence\
for eternity together as husband\
2:32\
and wife, inheriting “thrones, kingdoms,\
principalities, and powers, ...\
2:37\
and a continuation of the\
seeds forever and ever,”\
2:41\
receiving all that God the Father has.\
2:45\
The Lord revealed through\
Joseph Smith, “In\
2:48\
the celestial glory there are\
three heavens or degrees,\
2:53\
and in order to obtain the highest,\
2:56\
a man must enter into this\
order of the priesthood,\
2:59\
[meaning the new and everlasting\
covenant of marriage];\
3:02\
and if he does not, he cannot obtain it.\
3:05\
He may enter into the other, but\
that is the end of his kingdom;\
3:09\
he cannot have an increase.”\
3:12\
We learn here that one can be\
in the celestial kingdom,\
3:15\
or dwell in the presence\
of God, and be single,\
3:19\
but to be exalted in the highest degree\
of the celestial kingdom,\
3:23\
one must enter into marriage\
by the proper authority,\
3:27\
and then be true to the covenants\
made in that marriage.\
3:32\
As we are faithful to these covenants,\
3:35\
the Holy Spirit of promise can\
seal our marriage covenant.\
3:38\
Such sealed blessings become\
fruit that remains.\
3:45\
What is required to faithfully\
keep the new\
3:47\
and everlasting covenant of marriage?”\
3:50\
President Russell M. Nelson has taught\
that there are two types of bonds when\
3:55\
we enter into this eternal marriage\
covenant: a lateral bond between husband\
4:00\
and wife, and a vertical bond with God.\
4:04\
To have the blessings of exaltation\
sealed upon us\
4:08\
and remain after this life,\
4:10\
we must be true to both the lateral and\
the vertical bonds of the covenant.\
4:17\
To keep the lateral bond\
with your spouse,\
4:20\
God has counseled us to “love your wife\
[or husband] with all your heart,\
4:25\
and ... cleave unto her [or him],\
and none else.”\
4:30\
For those who are married, to\
cleave unto her or him\
4:33\
and none else means you counsel\
together in love,\
4:37\
you love and care for each other,\
4:39\
you prioritize time with your spouse\
over outside interests,\
4:43\
and you call upon God to help you\
overcome your weaknesses.\
4:48\
It also means there is\
no emotional intimacy\
4:52\
or sexual relations of any kind\
outside of your marriage,\
4:56\
including flirting or dating.\
5:00\
And there is no pornography,\
which engenders lust.\
5:05\
To keep the lateral bond\
in the covenant,\
5:08\
each partner must desire to be in the\
marriage. President Dallin H. Oaks\
5:13\
recently taught, “We\
also know that He [God]\
5:17\
will force no one into a sealing\
relationship against his or her will.\
5:24\
The blessings of a sealed\
relationship are assured\
5:27\
for all who keep their covenants,\
5:29\
but never by forcing a\
sealed relationship\
5:33\
on another person who is\
unworthy or unwilling.”\
5:38\
What is the vertical bond referred\
to by President Nelson?\
5:43\
The vertical bond is one we make with\
God. To keep the vertical bond with God,\
5:48\
we are true to the temple covenants\
we have made regarding\
5:51\
the laws of obedience, sacrifice, the\
gospel, chastity, and consecration.\
5:59\
We also covenant with God to receive\
our eternal companion and to be\
6:03\
a righteous spouse and\
partner and parent.\
6:07\
As we keep the vertical bond,\
6:09\
we qualify for the blessings of being\
part of the family of God through\
6:14\
the Abrahamic Covenant, including the\
blessings of posterity, the gospel,\
6:20\
and the priesthood. These blessings\
are also the fruit that remains.\
6:28\
While we hope that all who\
enter into the new\
6:30\
and everlasting covenant remain true and\
have the blessings sealed upon them\
6:34\
for all eternity, sometimes that\
ideal seems beyond our reach.\
6:41\
Throughout my ministry, I have\
encountered members who make\
6:45\
and keep covenants, but\
their spouse does not.\
6:49\
There are also those who are single,\
6:51\
never having the opportunity\
to marry in mortality.\
6:55\
And there are those who are not faithful\
to their marriage covenants.\
6:59\
What happens to individuals in\
each of these circumstances?\
7:04\
If you remain faithful to\
7:06\
the covenants you have made\
when you were endowed,\
7:09\
you will receive the personal blessings\
promised to you in the endowment\
7:15\
even if your spouse has broken his or\
her covenants or withdrawn from\
7:20\
the marriage. If you were sealed\
and later divorced,\
7:24\
and if your sealing is not canceled,\
7:27\
the personal blessings of that\
sealing remain in effect\
7:30\
for you if you remain faithful.\
7:34\
Sometimes due to feelings of betrayal\
and very real hurt,\
7:39\
a faithful spouse may want to cancel\
their sealing with their unfaithful\
7:44\
spouse, to get as far away\
as possible from them,\
7:47\
both on earth and for eternity.\
7:51\
If you are concerned that you\
will somehow be tied to\
7:54\
an unrepentant former spouse,\
remember, you will not!\
8:00\
God will not require\
anyone to remain in\
8:03\
a sealed relationship throughout\
eternity against his or her will.\
8:07\
Heavenly Father will ensure that we will\
receive every blessing that our\
8:11\
desires and choices allow.\
8:14\
However, if a cancellation of sealing\
is desired, agency is respected.\
8:22\
Certain procedures can be followed, but\
this should not be done casually.\
8:29\
The First Presidency holds the keys to\
bind on earth and in heaven.\
8:33\
Once a sealing cancellation has been\
granted by the First Presidency,\
8:38\
the blessings related to that sealing\
are no longer in force.\
8:42\
They are canceled both laterally\
and vertically.\
8:46\
It is important to understand that to\
receive the blessings of exaltation,\
8:52\
we must demonstrate that we\
are willing to enter into\
8:56\
and faithfully keep this new\
and everlasting covenant,\
9:00\
either in this life or the next.\
9:03\
For those who are single\
members of the Church,\
9:07\
please remember that in the\
Lord's own way and time,\
9:10\
no blessing will be withheld\
from His faithful saints.\
9:14\
The Lord will judge and reward each\
individual according to heartfelt\
9:19\
desires as well as deed. If you have\
not remained faithful to temple\
9:25\
covenants, is there hope? Yes!\
9:29\
The gospel of Jesus Christ\
is a gospel of hope.\
9:32\
That hope comes through Jesus Christ\
with sincere repentance\
9:35\
and obediently following\
Christ's teachings.\
9:39\
I have seen individuals\
make grave mistakes,\
9:43\
breaking sacred covenants.\
On a regular basis,\
9:47\
I see those who sincerely repent,\
are forgiven, and return to\
9:52\
the covenant path. If you have\
broken your temple covenants,\
9:58\
I urge you to turn to Jesus Christ.\
Counsel with your bishop.\
10:03\
Repent and open your soul to the\
mighty healing power available\
10:09\
because of the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ.\
10:12\
Brothers and sisters, our loving\
Heavenly Father has given us covenants\
10:17\
so that we may have access to all\
that He has in store for us.\
10:21\
These sacred blessings from God are more\
delicious than any earthly fruit.\
10:27\
They can be preserved for us forever,\
10:30\
becoming fruit that remains as we\
are faithful to our covenants.\
10:36\
I testify that God has restored the\
authority to bind on earth,\
10:40\
so it is bound in heaven.\
10:42\
That authority is found in The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
10:46\
It is held by the First Presidency\
and Quorum of the Twelve,\
10:50\
and is exercised under the direction\
of President Russell M. Nelson.\
10:54\
Those who enter into the new and\
everlasting covenant of marriage\
10:58\
and keep that covenant, can become\
perfected and eventually receive\
11:03\
the fullness of the glory of the Father,\
11:05\
regardless of circumstances\
beyond their control.\
11:09\
These promised blessings appertaining\
to our covenants can be sealed upon\
11:13\
us by the Holy Spirit of Promise,\
11:15\
and become fruit that remains\
forever and ever.\
11:20\
I so testify in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
