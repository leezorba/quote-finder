Many today say that miracles no longer\
exist, that angels are fictional,\
0:06\
and that the heavens are closed. I\
testify that miracles have not ceased,\
0:11\
angels are among us, and the\
heavens are truly open.\
0:15\
When our Savior, Jesus Christ,\
was on the earth,\
0:17\
He gave priesthood keys to\
His chief apostle, Peter.\
0:20\
Through these keys, Peter and\
the other apostles led\
0:23\
the Savior’s Church. But when\
those apostles died,\
0:27\
the keys of the priesthood were\
taken from the earth.\
0:29\
I testify that the ancient keys of the\
priesthood have been restored.\
0:34\
Peter, James, and John and other\
ancient prophets appeared\
0:38\
as resurrected beings, bestowing upon\
the Prophet Joseph Smith what\
0:43\
the Lord described as “the keys of\
my kingdom, and a dispensation of\
0:48\
the gospel.” Those same\
keys have been passed from prophet\
0:55\
to prophet until today. The 15 men\
we sustain as prophets, seers,\
1:00\
and revelators use them to\
lead the Savior's Church.\
1:04\
As in ancient times, there is\
one senior apostle who holds\
1:08\
and is authorized to exercise\
all priesthood keys.\
1:11\
He is President Russell M. Nelson,\
1:14\
Prophet and President of the\
restored Church of Christ\
1:18\
in our day: The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
1:22\
Through the Savior's Church,\
1:24\
we receive the blessings\
of the priesthood,\
1:26\
including the power of God\
to help us in our lives.\
1:30\
Under authorized priesthood keys,\
1:32\
we make sacred promises to God\
1:34\
and receive sacred ordinances that\
prepare us to live in His presence.\
1:38\
Beginning with baptism and\
confirmation and then in\
1:42\
the temple, we move forward on\
1:44\
a path of covenants that leads us back\
to Him. With hands laid on our heads,\
1:50\
we also receive priesthood blessings,\
including direction, comfort, counsel,\
1:56\
healing, and the power to\
follow Jesus Christ.\
2:00\
Throughout my life, I have been\
blessed by this great power.\
2:03\
As revealed in scripture,\
2:05\
we refer to it as the power of the\
holy Melchizedek Priesthood.\
2:09\
In my youth, I gained a great\
respect for this power,\
2:12\
especially as it was manifest\
in priesthood blessings.\
2:16\
While serving as a young\
missionary in Chile,\
2:18\
my companion and I were arrested and\
separated. We were never told why.\
2:24\
It was a time of great\
political upheaval.\
2:27\
Thousands of people were taken into\
custody by the military police\
2:31\
and never heard from again.\
2:33\
After being interrogated, I\
sat alone in a jail cell,\
2:37\
not knowing if I would ever\
see my loved ones again.\
2:40\
I turned to my Heavenly Father,\
fervently pleading, “Father,\
2:44\
I have always been taught that Thou\
watcheth over Thine missionaries.\
2:49\
Please, Father, I am nothing special,\
but I have been obedient,\
2:53\
and I need Thy help tonight.”\
2:56\
The seeds of this help had been\
planted many years earlier.\
3:00\
After my baptism, I was confirmed\
a member of the Church and given\
3:04\
the gift of the Holy Ghost.\
3:05\
As I prayed alone behind bars,\
3:08\
the Holy Ghost immediately came\
to me and comforted me.\
3:12\
He brought to my mind a very special\
passage from my patriarchal blessing,\
3:16\
which is another blessing\
of the priesthood.\
3:19\
In it, God promised me that\
through my faithfulness,\
3:23\
I would be able to be sealed in the\
temple for time and eternity\
3:27\
to a woman full of beauty\
and virtue and love,\
3:31\
that we would become the parents\
of precious sons and daughters,\
3:36\
that I would be blessed and magnified\
as a father in Israel.\
3:39\
Those inspired words about my future\
filled my soul with peace.\
3:44\
I knew that they had come from my loving\
Heavenly Father who always keeps\
3:48\
His promises. In that moment,\
3:51\
I had the assurance that\
I would be released\
3:53\
and live to see those\
promises fulfilled.\
3:57\
About a year later, Heavenly\
Father did bless me with\
4:00\
a wife who is full of beauty\
and virtue and love.\
4:04\
Lynette and I were sealed in the temple.\
4:06\
We were blessed with three precious\
sons and four precious daughters.\
4:11\
I became a father, all according\
to God's promises and\
4:15\
the patriarchal blessing I received\
as a 17-year-old boy.\
4:20\
“Wherefore, my beloved brethren [and\
sisters], have miracles ceased\
4:24\
because Christ hath ascended\
into heaven? ...\
4:27\
Nay, neither have angels ceased to\
minister unto the children of men.”\
4:32\
I testify that miracles and\
ministrations are continually\
4:37\
occurring in our lives, often as a\
direct result of priesthood power.\
4:41\
Some priesthood blessings are fulfilled\
immediately in ways we can see\
4:46\
and understand. Others are\
unfolding gradually\
4:49\
and will not be fully realized\
in this life.\
4:52\
But God keeps all of His\
promises always,\
4:56\
as illustrated in this account\
from our family history.\
5:00\
My paternal grandfather, Grant Reese\
Bowen, was a man of great faith.\
5:05\
I vividly remember hearing him recount\
how he received his own patriarchal\
5:10\
blessing. In his journal\
5:12\
he recorded: “The patriarch promised\
me the gift of healing.\
5:16\
He said, ’The sick shall be healed.\
5:19\
Yea, the dead shall be raised\
under your hands.’”\
5:23\
Years later, grandfather was piling hay\
when he felt prompted to return to\
5:28\
the house. He was met by his\
father coming toward him.\
5:32\
“Grant, your mother has just passed\
away,” his father said.\
5:36\
I quote again from\
grandfather’s journal.\
5:39\
“I didn’t stop, but went hurrying into\
the house and out on the front porch,\
5:43\
where she lay on a cot. I looked at her\
5:45\
and could see that there was no\
sign of life left in her.\
5:49\
I remembered my patriarchal blessing\
and the promise that if\
5:53\
I were faithful, through my faith\
5:55\
the sick would be healed and\
the dead would be raised.\
5:58\
I placed my hands on her head,\
6:00\
and I told the Lord that if the promise\
that He had made to me by\
6:05\
the patriarch was true, to make\
it manifest at this time\
6:09\
and raise my mother back to life. I\
promised Him if He would do this,\
6:13\
I should never hesitate to\
do all in my power for\
6:17\
the building up of of His kingdom.\
6:19\
As I prayed, she opened her eyes\
and said, ’Grant, raise me up.\
6:24\
I have been in the spirit world,\
but you have called me back.\
6:28\
Let this always be a testimony to you\
and to the rest of my family.’”\
6:33\
President Russell M. Nelson has taught\
us to seek and expect miracles.\
6:38\
I testify that because the priesthood\
has been restored,\
6:42\
the power and authority of God are\
upon the earth. Through callings\
6:46\
and councils, men and women,\
young and old,\
6:50\
can participate in priesthood work.\
6:52\
It is a work of miracles\
attended by angels.\
6:56\
It is the work of heaven and it\
blesses all God's children.\
7:00\
In 1989, our family of seven was\
returning from a ward outing.\
7:04\
It was late. Lynette was expecting\
our sixth child.\
7:08\
She felt a strong prompting\
to fasten her seat belt,\
7:11\
which she had forgotten to do.\
7:13\
Shortly thereafter, we came\
around a bend in the road.\
7:17\
A car crossed the line into our lane,\
going about 70 miles an hour.\
7:22\
I swerved to avoid hitting\
the oncoming car.\
7:25\
Our van rolled, skidded down the\
highway and slid off the road,\
7:29\
finally coming to a stop landing with\
the passenger side in the dirt.\
7:34\
The next thing I remember hearing\
was Lynette’s voice:\
7:37\
“Shayne, we need to get out\
through your door.”\
7:40\
I was hanging in the air by my seatbelt.\
It took a few seconds to get oriented.\
7:45\
We started lifting each\
of the children out of\
7:48\
the van through my window, which\
was now the ceiling of the van.\
7:52\
They were crying, wondering\
what had happened.\
7:55\
We soon realized that our 10-year-\
old daughter, Emily was missing.\
8:00\
We yelled her name, but\
there was no response.\
8:03\
Ward members who were also\
traveling home were at\
8:06\
the scene frantically looking\
for her. It was so dark.\
8:10\
I looked in the van again with a\
flashlight and to my horror,\
8:14\
saw Emily's tiny body trapped\
under the van.\
8:17\
I called out desperately, “We have\
to lift the van off of Emily.”\
8:21\
I grabbed the roof and pulled back.\
8:24\
There were only a few others lifting,\
8:26\
but the van miraculously flipped\
onto its wheels,\
8:29\
exposing Emily’s lifeless body.\
Emily was not breathing. Her\
8:34\
face was the color of a purple plum. I\
said, “We need to give her a blessing.”\
8:40\
A dear friend and ward\
member knelt with me,\
8:43\
and by the authority of the\
Melchizedek Priesthood,\
8:46\
in the name of Jesus Christ, we\
commanded her to live. In that moment\
8:51\
Emily took a long, raspy breath.\
8:54\
After what seemed like hours, the\
ambulance finally arrived.\
8:57\
Emily was rushed to the hospital.\
8:59\
She had a collapsed lung and a\
severed tendon in her knee.\
9:03\
Brain damage was a concern because of\
the time she was without oxygen.\
9:08\
Emily was in a coma for\
a day and a half.\
9:10\
We continued to pray and fast for her.\
She was blessed with a full recovery.\
9:16\
Today, Emily and her husband, Kevin,\
are the parents of six daughters.\
9:21\
Miraculously, everyone else\
was able to walk away.\
9:25\
The baby Lynette was carrying was Tyson.\
9:27\
He too was spared any harm and\
was born the next February.\
9:33\
Eight months later, after receiving\
his earthly body,\
9:36\
Tyson returned home to Heavenly Father.\
He is our guardian angel son.\
9:41\
We feel his influence in our family\
9:43\
and look forward to being\
with him again.\
9:46\
Those who lifted the van off\
of Emily observed that\
9:50\
the van seemed to weigh nothing.\
9:53\
I knew that heavenly angels had joined\
with earthly angels to lift\
9:57\
the vehicle off of Emily’s body.\
I also know that, Emily\
10:00\
was brought back to life by the\
power of the holy priesthood.\
10:05\
The Lord revealed this truth\
to His servants:\
10:08\
“For I will go before your face.\
10:10\
I will be on your right\
hand and on your left,\
10:13\
and my Spirit shall be in\
your hearts, and mine\
10:16\
angels round about you to bear you up.”\
10:19\
I testify that “the Holy Priesthood,\
after the Order of the Son of God”—\
10:24\
the Melchizedek Priesthood—with\
its keys, authority, and power\
10:28\
has been restored to the earth\
in these latter days.\
10:31\
I know that while not all circumstances\
turn out like we may hope and pray\
10:36\
for, God’s miracles will always come\
according to His will, His timing,\
10:42\
and His plan for us. If you desire\
the blessings of the priesthood,\
10:47\
including miracles and the\
ministering of angels,\
10:50\
I invite you to walk the path of\
covenants God has made available to\
10:53\
each of us. Members and leaders of\
10:56\
the Church, who love you, will help\
you take the next step.\
10:59\
I testify that Jesus Christ,\
the Son of God,\
11:03\
lives and leads His Church through\
living prophets who hold\
11:07\
and exercise priesthood keys.\
The Holy Ghost is real.\
11:11\
The Savior gave His life to heal us,\
reclaim us, and bring us home.\
11:17\
I witness that miracles have not ceased.\
11:20\
Angels are among us and the heavens are\
open, and oh, how open they are!\
11:26\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
