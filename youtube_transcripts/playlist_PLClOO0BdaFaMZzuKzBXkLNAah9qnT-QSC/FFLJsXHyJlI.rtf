In preparing to speak to you,\
0:03\
I have been drawn to the story of\
Helaman and the stripling sons of\
0:07\
the people of Ammon. I have\
felt the power of\
0:10\
the Book of Mormon prophets\
teaching parents, bishops,\
0:14\
and ward members through\
studying this account.\
0:18\
Helaman was a man that the young\
Ammonites could trust.\
0:23\
He helped them develop and\
mature in righteousness.\
0:27\
They knew and loved him and would\
that he should be their leader.\
0:33\
Helaman loved these young men like\
sons and saw their potential.\
0:38\
Elder Dale G. Renlund taught that\
to effectively serve others,\
0:43\
we must see them through\
Heavenly Father's eyes.\
0:47\
Only then can we begin to comprehend\
the true worth of a soul.\
0:52\
Only then can we sense the love\
that Heavenly Father has\
0:56\
for all His children. Bishops today are\
blessed with discernment to see\
1:02\
the divine identity of the\
youth in their care.\
1:07\
Helaman numbered the young\
men in his care.\
1:10\
He prioritized building strong\
relationships with them. At\
1:14\
a critical time when life and\
death hung in the balance,\
1:18\
Helaman and his young warriors lost\
track of the army pursuing them.\
1:23\
Helaman counseled with the youth.\
Behold, we know not\
1:27\
but they have halted for the purpose\
that we should come against them.\
1:32\
Therefore, what say you, my sons?\
1:35\
These faithful young men, responded,\
Father, behold, our God is with us,\
1:41\
and He will not suffer that we should\
fall. Then let us go forth.\
1:47\
The day was won as Helaman supported\
these young men in their resolve to\
1:53\
act. The young Ammonites had a great\
cause and were valiant in\
1:59\
the support of the people.\
2:01\
This little force, led by Helaman,\
2:04\
spread great hopes and much\
joy into the hearts of\
2:07\
the experienced Nephite armies.\
2:10\
Bishops today can lead their uniquely\
gifted youth in blessing the ward\
2:15\
and gathering Israel. President Nelson\
has taught that this is the mission\
2:21\
for which they were sent to earth.\
2:25\
Like these young Ammonites who were true\
at all times in whatsoever thing\
2:29\
they were entrusted, Helaman faithfully\
followed his leaders,\
2:34\
no matter the challenge or setback.\
2:36\
Helaman always remained fixed with\
2:39\
a determination to advance\
their purpose.\
2:42\
When he was directed to march forth\
with his little sons, he obeyed.\
2:49\
The youth today are blessed as bishops\
2:51\
follow the guidance of our leaders to\
counsel with the ward Young Women\
2:56\
presidents. Stake presidents\
ensure that bishops\
3:00\
and Young Women presidents are\
instructed in fulfilling their\
3:04\
responsibilities for the youth.\
Helaman honored covenants.\
3:10\
When Ammon taught the gospel to the\
parents of the stripling young men,\
3:14\
they embraced it with open hearts.\
3:17\
They were so committed to their new life\
of righteous discipleship that\
3:21\
they made a covenant to lay down\
the weapons of their rebellion.\
3:26\
The only thing that caused them to\
consider breaking this covenant,\
3:30\
going back to their familiar\
past of fighting,\
3:33\
was seeing the Nephites in danger.\
3:36\
The Ammonites wanted to help these\
people who had offered them a safe home.\
3:42\
Helaman, along with others, persuaded\
them to keep their covenant\
3:45\
never to fight. He trusted more in\
3:48\
the strength that God would\
provide than in\
3:51\
the strength these Ammonites could have\
provided with their swords and arrows.\
3:57\
When Helaman and his young warriors\
faced daunting challenges,\
4:02\
Helaman was resolute. Behold,\
it mattereth not.\
4:06\
We trust God will deliver us.\
4:09\
In one instance, on the verge\
of starving to death,\
4:13\
their response was to pour out\
their souls in prayer to God,\
4:17\
that He would strengthen them\
and deliver them, and\
4:21\
the Lord did visit them with assurances\
that He would deliver them\
4:24\
because of their exceeding faith in\
that which they had been taught to\
4:30\
believe. We learn from Helaman that\
these young men were supported by their\
4:35\
parents. These faithful parents knew\
they had the primary responsibility\
4:41\
for teaching their children.\
4:43\
They taught their children\
to keep the commandments\
4:46\
and walk uprightly before God.\
4:48\
Their mothers taught them that if they\
did not doubt, God would deliver them.\
4:54\
Their fathers set a powerful\
example of covenant making.\
4:59\
These former warriors knew\
the horrors of battle.\
5:02\
They entrusted their inexperienced sons\
to Helaman’s care and supported them\
5:07\
by sending many provisions.\
5:11\
Helaman wasn't alone as he\
served his young army.\
5:14\
He had people around him who he turned\
to for support and guidance.\
5:20\
He reached out to Captain Moroni\
for help and it came.\
5:25\
No one serving in the Lord's\
kingdom serves alone.\
5:29\
The Lord has blessed us\
with wards and stakes.\
5:32\
Through His restored organization,\
we have the resources,\
5:37\
wisdom, and inspiration to\
meet any challenge.\
5:43\
A bishop provides guidance for\
the ward through counsels.\
5:46\
He promotes quarterly ministering\
interviews\
5:49\
and then encourages the elders quorum\
and Relief Society to fulfill their\
5:53\
responsibility of ministering\
to families.\
5:58\
These presidencies take the\
lead in assessing needs\
6:01\
and finding inspired solutions.\
6:04\
Stake presidents offer support\
by instructing\
6:07\
the elders quorum and Relief Society\
presidencies in these responsibilities.\
6:14\
The needed guidance for leaders\
and parents is found in\
6:17\
the Gospel Library and the\
Gospel Living apps.\
6:21\
In these inspired resources,\
6:23\
we can find the scriptures, teachings of\
modern prophets, and the General Handbook.\
6:30\
The youth tab in the Gospel Library\
has many resources for quorum\
6:36\
and class presidencies and\
“For the Strength of Youth:\
6:39\
A Guide for Making Choices.”\
6:42\
As all members of the ward study\
these inspired sources\
6:46\
and seek guidance from the Spirit,\
6:49\
everyone will be directed by the Lord\
in strengthening the youth.\
6:54\
The entire ward will be blessed and\
strengthened as members focus\
6:58\
on the rising generation.\
7:01\
Despite our imperfections\
and shortcomings,\
7:03\
Heavenly Father invites\
each of us through\
7:06\
the companionship of His Spirit\
to reach out to others.\
7:11\
He knows that we grow and are sanctified\
as we follow the promptings of\
7:16\
the Holy Ghost. It doesn't matter\
that our efforts are imperfect.\
7:20\
When we partner with the Lord,\
7:22\
we can trust that our efforts will be\
in line with what He would do for\
7:26\
the youth. By following the direction of\
the Holy Ghost and reaching out to\
7:32\
the youth, we become witnesses of\
Heavenly Father's love in their lives.\
7:38\
Acting on promptings from the Lord\
builds relationships of love and trust.\
7:45\
It is relationships in the lives\
of the youth that have\
7:50\
the greatest influence on their choices.\
7:55\
The youth will learn the pattern of\
revelation as they participate with us\
8:00\
in the process of seeking and acting\
upon promptings to serve others.\
8:06\
As the youth turn to the Lord\
for this inspired guidance,\
8:09\
their relationships with and\
trust in Him will deepen.\
8:15\
We express our confidence in the\
youth by offering support\
8:18\
and direction without taking over.\
8:22\
As we step back and allow the youth to\
learn through counseling together,\
8:27\
choosing an inspired course, and putting\
their plan into action,\
8:31\
they will experience true\
joy and growth.\
8:35\
President Henry B. Eyring taught that\
what will matter most is what they\
8:40\
learn from you about who they really are\
and what they can really become.\
8:45\
My guess is that they won't learn\
it so much from lectures.\
8:50\
They will get it from feelings of who\
you are, who you think they are,\
8:55\
and what you think they might become.\
8:58\
Our youth amaze us with their courage,\
their faith,\
9:02\
and their abilities. As they choose\
to be fully engaged disciples of\
9:06\
Jesus Christ, His gospel will\
be etched upon their hearts.\
9:11\
Following Him will become a part of who\
they are, not just what they do.\
9:17\
Helaman helped the young\
Ammonites to see how\
9:20\
a valiant disciple of\
Jesus Christ lived.\
9:23\
We can be powerful examples to\
9:25\
the youth of how disciples\
of Christ live today.\
9:29\
Faithful parents are praying for these\
examples in the lives of their children.\
9:35\
No program can replace the influence\
of loving, covenant-keeping adults.\
9:43\
As the president of the priests quorum,\
9:45\
the bishop can set an example for the\
youth of how to be a loyal husband\
9:50\
and loving father through protecting,\
providing,\
9:53\
and presiding in righteous ways.\
9:58\
Bishops with a laser-like focus\
on the youth will have\
10:02\
an influence that will\
last for generations.\
10:07\
The youth today are among Heavenly\
Father's most noble spirits.\
10:11\
They were among the stalwart defenders\
of truth and agency in\
10:15\
the premortal world. They were born in\
these days to gather Israel through\
10:20\
their powerful witness of\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
10:23\
He knows each one of them and\
knows their great potential.\
10:27\
He is patient as they grow. He\
will redeem and protect them.\
10:33\
He will heal and guide them.\
He will inspire them.\
10:38\
We, their parents and leaders, have\
been prepared to support them.\
10:43\
We have the Savior's Church to assist\
us as we raise the next generation.\
10:48\
I bear witness that Christ's Church,\
10:51\
restored through the Prophet Joseph\
Smith and led today by\
10:55\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
10:57\
is organized to help the youth fulfill\
their great purpose in these latter\
11:02\
days. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
