Don't you love those beautiful\
words we just sang?\
0:06\
“I’ll strengthen thee, help thee,\
and cause thee to stand,\
0:11\
upheld by my righteous,\
omnipotent hand.”\
0:16\
The Lord is strengthening\
His saints of all ages\
0:20\
as they come to His holy house.\
0:22\
From Kinshasa to Zollikofen\
to Fukuoka to Oakland,\
0:28\
the youth of their own initiative are\
overflowing temple baptistries.\
0:34\
In the past, most beloved ordinance\
workers had graying hair,\
0:39\
but not anymore. Called missionaries,\
0:42\
service missionaries, and returned\
missionaries are around every corner.\
0:49\
Across the world there’s a growing\
feeling drawing us to the house of\
0:53\
the Lord. Just over a year ago,\
a dear family friend, aged 95,\
1:00\
living on the East Coast\
of the United States,\
1:03\
who had been taught by missionaries for\
70 years, said to her daughter,\
1:09\
“I want to go to the temple with you.”\
1:11\
Her daughter replied, “Well, mother, you\
first need to be baptized.” “Okay,”\
1:17\
she replied, “then I want to be\
baptized.” She was baptized.\
1:23\
A few days later, she reverently\
entered the temple baptistry,\
1:28\
and just over a month ago she received\
her own endowment and sealing.\
1:35\
“The knowledge and power\
of God are expanding;\
1:38\
The veil o’er the earth is\
beginning to burst.”\
1:44\
Have you wondered why the Lord would\
direct His prophet to now dot\
1:50\
the earth with His holy temples?\
1:53\
Why would He, at this specific time,\
1:56\
give the needed prosperity\
to His covenant people,\
2:00\
that through their sacred tithes,\
2:02\
hundreds of houses of the\
Lord could be built?\
2:06\
This morning President Oaks showed\
a beautiful visual of\
2:09\
the temples being constructed\
across the world.\
2:12\
Cathy and I were recently in the\
Philippines. Think of this miracle.\
2:18\
The Manila Temple was dedicated in 1984.\
2:22\
It would be 26 years before\
2:24\
the second temple in Cebu City\
was completed in 2010.\
2:29\
Now, 14 years later, 11 temples\
are being constructed,\
2:35\
designed, or prepared for dedication\
from the north to the south: Liwagu,\
2:41\
Tuguegarao, Santiago, Urdaneta,\
2:45\
Alabang, Naga, Tacloban\
City, Iloilo, Bacolod,\
2:53\
Cagayan de Oro, and Davao.\
2:57\
It is breathtaking to see the wondrous\
works of God. Across the globe,\
3:05\
houses of the Lord are coming closer\
to us. Why in our day?\
3:11\
The Lord told us that in the last days,\
there would be distress among nations,\
3:17\
people would be “lovers\
of their own selves,”\
3:20\
“all things [would] be in commotion,”\
3:23\
confusion would abound, and “men’s\
hearts would fail them.”\
3:29\
We have certainly seen men's and\
women's hearts fail them.\
3:32\
The enticements of the world, the\
distraction of alluring voices,\
3:37\
the neglect of spiritual nourishment,\
3:41\
the fatigue from the demands\
of discipleship.\
3:45\
Perhaps you have been saddened as\
you have seen someone you love,\
3:50\
who at one time spoke sincerely of his\
3:53\
and her faith in Jesus Christ, bore\
witness of the Book of Mormon,\
3:58\
and eagerly helped build\
the kingdom of God,\
4:01\
suddenly move away, at least for now,\
4:04\
from his or her beliefs toward\
the sidelines of the Church.\
4:09\
My counsel to you is don't despair.\
4:13\
All is well, for with God\
nothing is impossible.\
4:19\
With this prophesied commotion\
and disbelief in the world,\
4:23\
the Lord promised that there\
would be a covenant people,\
4:27\
a people eagerly awaiting His return,\
4:30\
a people who stand in holy settings and\
are not moved out of their place.\
4:36\
He spoke of a righteous people\
resisting the deceptions of\
4:41\
the adversary, disciplining their faith,\
thinking celestial,\
4:46\
and trusting completely in\
the Savior Jesus Christ.\
4:51\
Why is the Lord now bringing hundreds\
of His temples closer to us?\
4:57\
One reason is that amid the turmoil\
and temptations of the world,\
5:02\
He has promised to strengthen and\
bless His covenant Saints\
5:07\
and His promises are being fulfilled.\
5:12\
How do these holy houses strengthen,\
comfort, and protect us?\
5:17\
We find an answer in the pleadings\
of the Prophet Joseph Smith in\
5:21\
the dedication of the Kirtland Temple.\
5:23\
It was in this temple where the\
Saints sang, “We’ll sing\
5:26\
and we’ll shout with the\
armies of heaven.”\
5:29\
The Savior Himself appeared, and\
prophets of old returned,\
5:34\
bestowing additional priesthood\
keys to the restored gospel.\
5:38\
On that sacred occasion in\
the Kirtland Temple,\
5:41\
the Prophet prayed that in\
the Lord’s holy house,\
5:45\
the Saints would be armed\
with the power of God,\
5:48\
that the name of Jesus Christ\
would be upon them,\
5:52\
that His angels would have\
charge over them,\
5:55\
and that they would grow up in the\
Lord and receive a fulness of\
5:59\
the Holy Ghost. These powerful\
supplications are fulfilled in our\
6:04\
lives as we faithfully worship in the\
house of the Lord. In His house\
6:12\
we are literally endowed\
with heavenly power.\
6:16\
Our faith in Jesus Christ and our love\
for Him is confirmed and fortified.\
6:21\
We are spiritually assured of our true\
identity and the purposes of life.\
6:27\
As we are faithful, we are blessed\
with protection from temptations\
6:32\
and distractions. We feel\
our Savior's love\
6:37\
as He lifts us from our difficulties\
and sorrows.\
6:41\
We are armed with the power of God.\
6:46\
In His holy house, we take His name more\
completely upon us. When we are baptized\
6:52\
we profess our belief in Him\
6:54\
and our willingness to keep His\
commandments. In the temple,\
6:59\
we sacredly promise through our\
covenants to follow Him forever.\
7:07\
The youth of this Church are incredible.\
7:09\
In a difficult world, they take upon\
themselves the name of Christ.\
7:14\
In Heber City, Utah, a public meeting\
was held to discuss the details of\
7:19\
a temple planned for construction.\
7:22\
Three hundred youth filled the adjoining\
park to show their support for\
7:27\
the proposed temple. One young man,\
7:29\
speaking to government leaders\
in an open forum,\
7:33\
courageously explained, “I am hoping\
to be married in this temple.\
7:37\
[The temple] will help me to keep\
myself clean and pure.”\
7:42\
Another described the temple as\
a symbol of light and hope.\
7:48\
Young men and women of the Church\
throughout the world are embracing\
7:52\
the name of Jesus Christ.\
In the Kirtland Temple,\
7:58\
the Prophet Joseph prayed that “angels\
[would] have charge over [His Saints].”\
8:04\
Regularly performing ordinances for\
our ancestors in the temple brings\
8:10\
a sweet and sure confirmation that\
life continues beyond the veil.\
8:17\
Although many of our experiences\
in the house of\
8:20\
the Lord are too sacred to share\
publicly, some we can share.\
8:25\
Forty years ago,\
while living in Florida,\
8:28\
Kathy and I traveled to the temple\
in Atlanta, Georgia.\
8:32\
On Wednesday night, May 9, 1984,\
8:36\
as we completed a session in the temple,\
8:39\
an ordinance worker approached\
me and asked if\
8:42\
I had time to do just one preparatory\
initiatory ordinance.\
8:46\
The name of the person I represented\
was unusual.\
8:50\
His name was Eleazer Cercy. The next\
day, the temple was full of saints.\
8:58\
As I prepared to perform my second\
endowment of the day,\
9:02\
I was given the name of the\
person I would represent.\
9:06\
Surprisingly, the name was the same\
individual from the night before:\
9:13\
Eleazer Cercy. I felt the Spirit of the\
Lord as the endowment was completed.\
9:20\
Later in the afternoon,\
still in the temple,\
9:23\
Kathy saw an elderly family friend,\
Sister Dolly Fernandez,\
9:28\
who now lived in Atlanta. With no male\
members of her family with her,\
9:34\
she asked if I could possibly assist in\
9:38\
the sealing of her father\
to her father's parents.\
9:42\
I, of course, was very honored.\
9:45\
As I knelt at the end of the altar\
for this sacred ordinance,\
9:50\
I heard once again the name that\
was now inscribed in my mind,\
9:56\
her father, Eleazer Cercy.\
10:02\
I fully believe that following\
this life,\
10:05\
I will meet and embrace a man known in\
his mortal life as Eleazer Cercy.\
10:13\
Most of our experiences in the house\
of the Lord bring joyful peace\
10:18\
and quiet revelation more than\
dramatic intervention.\
10:23\
But be assured, angels do\
have charge over us.\
10:30\
The gift of the Holy Ghost is given to\
us as we are confirmed a member of\
10:34\
the Church. Each week as we worthily\
partake of the bread\
10:38\
and water in remembrance of our Savior,\
10:41\
we are promised His Spirit\
will always be with us.\
10:45\
As we come with willing hearts\
to the house of the Lord,\
10:48\
the most holy place on earth,\
10:51\
we grow up in the Lord and can receive\
a fulness of the Holy Ghost. Through\
10:58\
the power of the Holy Ghost,\
11:00\
we are filled with peace and\
joy and unspeakable hope.\
11:07\
We receive the strength to remain His\
disciples even when we find ourselves\
11:13\
outside of holy places. President\
Russell M. Nelson has declared, “Our\
11:20\
Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, will\
perform some of His mightiest works\
11:26\
between now and when He comes again.\
11:28\
We will see miraculous indications\
that God the Father\
11:33\
and Jesus Christ preside over this\
Church in majesty and glory.”\
11:40\
Dotting the Earth with houses\
of the Lord is a mighty work\
11:46\
and miraculous indication.\
11:50\
My beloved friends, if we are\
able, and have not already\
11:54\
increased our attendance at\
11:56\
the temple, let us regularly find more\
time to worship in the house of\
12:00\
the Lord. Let us pray for\
12:03\
the temples that have been announced\
that properties can be purchased,\
12:07\
that governments will approve plans,\
12:10\
that talented workers will see\
their gifts magnified,\
12:13\
and that the sacred dedications will\
bring the approval of heaven and\
12:19\
the visit of angels. The temple is\
literally the house of the Lord.\
12:27\
I promise you, as you come worthily\
and prayerfully to His holy house,\
12:32\
you will be armed with His power,\
His name will be upon you,\
12:37\
His angels will have charge over you,\
12:40\
and you will grow up in the blessing\
of the Holy Ghost.\
12:45\
The Lord promised, “Every soul who\
forsaketh His sins, and cometh unto me,\
12:51\
and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my\
voice, and keepeth my commandments,\
12:57\
shall see my face, and know that I am.”\
13:02\
There are many different ways\
to see the face of Christ,\
13:06\
and there is no better place\
than in His holy house.\
13:10\
In this day of confusion and commotion,\
13:14\
I testify that the temple is His holy\
house and will help preserve us,\
13:21\
protect us, and prepare us for\
the glorious day when,\
13:28\
with all His holy angels, our Savior\
returns in majesty, power,\
13:35\
and great glory. In the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
