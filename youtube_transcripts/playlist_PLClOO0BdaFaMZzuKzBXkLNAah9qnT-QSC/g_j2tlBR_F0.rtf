Brothers and sisters, I’ve\
learned a painful lesson\
0:06\
since I last occupied this pulpit in\
October of 2022. That lesson is:\
0:16\
If you don't give an acceptable talk,\
0:18\
you can be banned for the next\
several conferences.\
0:27\
You can see I'm assigned early in\
the first session of this one.\
0:32\
What you can’t see is that I’m\
positioned on a trap door\
0:41\
with a very delicate latch.\
0:45\
This talk doesn’t go well, I won’t see\
you for another few conferences.\
0:53\
Actually in the spirit\
of that beautiful,\
0:56\
beautiful hymn with this beautiful,\
beautiful choir,\
1:01\
I have learned some lessons recently\
that, with the Lord’s help,\
1:05\
I wish to share with you today.\
1:09\
That will make this\
a very personal talk.\
1:14\
The most personal and painful of all has\
been the passing of my beloved wife,\
1:21\
Pat. She was the greatest woman I have\
ever known. A perfect wife and mother,\
1:30\
to say nothing of her purity, her gift\
of expression, her spirituality.\
1:38\
She gave a talk once titled “Fulfilling\
the Measure of Your Creation.”\
1:45\
It seems to me that she fulfilled\
1:46\
the measure of her creation more\
successfully than anyone could have\
1:51\
dreamed possible. She was a\
complete daughter of God,\
1:57\
an exemplary woman of Christ.\
2:00\
I was the most fortunate of men to spend\
60 years of my life with her.\
2:06\
Should I prove worthy, our sealing\
means I can spend eternity with her.\
2:15\
Another experience began 48 hours\
after my wife's burial.\
2:22\
At that time, I was rushed to the\
hospital in an acute medical crisis.\
2:29\
I then spent the first four\
weeks of a six-week stay,\
2:34\
in and out of intensive care and\
in and out of consciousness.\
2:41\
Virtually all my experience in\
2:43\
the hospital during that first\
period is lost to my memory.\
2:49\
What is not lost is my memory of\
a journey outside the hospital,\
2:55\
out to what seemed the edge of eternity.\
3:00\
I cannot speak fully of\
that experience here,\
3:04\
but I can say that part of what\
I received was an admonition\
3:11\
to return to my ministry with more\
urgency, more consecration,\
3:17\
more focus on the Savior,\
more faith in His word.\
3:24\
I couldn't help but feel I was receiving\
my own personal version of\
3:31\
a revelation given to the Twelve\
nearly 200 years ago:\
3:36\
“Thou shalt bear record of my name ...\
3:38\
[and] send forth my word unto\
the ends of the earth.”\
3:43\
“Morning by morning; and day after day\
let thy warning voice go forth;\
3:51\
and when the night cometh\
3:53\
let not the inhabitants of the earth\
slumber because of thy speech.”\
4:00\
“Arise[,] ... take up your cross,\
and follow me.”\
4:06\
My beloved sisters and brothers, since\
that experience, I have tried\
4:14\
to take up my cross more earnestly,\
4:17\
with more resolve to find where I can\
raise an apostolic voice of both warmth\
4:24\
and warning in the morning, during\
the day, and into the night.\
4:32\
That leads me to a third truth that\
came in those months of loss\
4:37\
and illness and distress.\
4:40\
It was a renewed witness of,\
4:43\
and endless gratitude for, the resolute\
prayers of this Church—your prayers—\
4:53\
of which I’ve been the beneficiary.\
4:56\
I will be eternally grateful for the\
supplication of thousands of people\
5:03\
who, like the importuning widow,\
5:06\
repeatedly sought heaven's intervention\
in my behalf.\
5:12\
I received priesthood blessings.\
5:14\
I saw my high school class fast for me,\
5:19\
as did several random wards\
across the Church.\
5:23\
And my name must have been on\
5:25\
the prayer roll of virtually\
every temple in the Church.\
5:31\
In my profound gratitude for all this,\
5:33\
I join G. K. Chesterton, who\
said once that “thanks are\
5:38\
the highest form of thought;\
5:40\
and ... gratitude is happiness\
doubled by wonder.”\
5:44\
With my own “happiness doubled by\
wonder,” I thank all of you.\
5:49\
And thank my Father in Heaven who heard\
your prayers and blessed my life.\
5:56\
Now, brothers and sisters,\
5:57\
I testify that God hears\
every prayer we offer\
6:02\
and responds to each of them according\
to the path He has outlined\
6:06\
for our perfection. I recognize\
that at roughly the same time\
6:11\
so many were praying for the\
restoration of my health,\
6:15\
an equal number, including me,\
6:17\
were praying for the restoration\
of my wife's health.\
6:22\
And I testify that both of those prayers\
were heard and answered by\
6:27\
a divinely compassionate\
Heavenly Father,\
6:30\
even if the prayers for Pat were\
not answered the way I asked.\
6:36\
It’s for reasons known only to God why\
6:39\
prayers are answered differently\
than we hope—\
6:43\
but I promise you, they are heard,\
6:46\
and they are answered according to His\
unfailing love and cosmic timetable.\
6:55\
Now if we “ask not amiss,” there\
are no limits to when,\
7:00\
where, or about what we should pray.\
7:04\
According to the revelations,\
we’re to “pray always.”\
7:07\
We are to pray, Amulek said,\
7:09\
for “those who are around you,” with the\
belief that the “fervent prayer of\
7:15\
a righteous [people] availeth much.”\
7:19\
Our prayers ought to be vocal when we\
have the privacy to so offer them.\
7:23\
If that is not practical,\
7:25\
they should be carried as silent\
utterances in our heart.\
7:30\
We sing that prayers are “motion[s]\
of a hidden fire,”\
7:37\
always to be offered, according\
to the Savior—\
7:40\
according to the Savior Himself,\
to God the Eternal Father,\
7:45\
in the name of His Only Begotten Son.\
My beloved friends,\
7:50\
our prayers are our sweetest, our\
“most sincere desire,” our simplest,\
7:57\
purest form of worship. We should pray\
individually, in our families,\
8:03\
and in congregations of all sizes.\
8:06\
We are to employ prayer as a\
shield against temptation,\
8:10\
and if there be any time\
we feel not to pray,\
8:13\
we can be sure that hesitancy\
does not come from God,\
8:18\
who yearns to communicate with His\
children at any and all times.\
8:24\
Indeed, some efforts to keep us from\
praying come directly from\
8:28\
the adversary. And when we don't know\
how or exactly for what to pray,\
8:34\
we should begin and continue until\
the Holy Spirit guides us into\
8:41\
the prayer we should be offering.\
8:44\
This approach may be the one we have to\
invoke when praying for our enemies\
8:50\
and those who despitefully use us.\
8:54\
Ultimately, we can look to the\
Savior's example who prayed\
8:58\
so very, very often. But it has always\
been intriguing to me that Jesus felt\
9:04\
the need to pray at all. Wasn’t He\
perfect? About what did He need to pray?\
9:11\
Well, I’ve come to realize\
that He too, with us,\
9:15\
wanted to “seek [the Father’s] face,\
believe his word, and trust his grace.”\
9:23\
Time after time, He retreated from\
society to be alone before piercing\
9:29\
heaven with His prayers. At other times\
He prayed in\
9:34\
the company of a few companions.\
9:36\
Then He would seek heaven on behalf of\
multitudes who would cover a hillside.\
9:42\
Sometimes prayer glorified His clothing.\
Sometimes it glorified His countenance.\
9:49\
Sometimes He stood to pray.\
Sometimes He knelt.\
9:54\
And at least once He fell\
on His face in prayer.\
10:00\
Luke describes Jesus’s descent\
into His expiation\
10:04\
as requiring Him to\
pray “more earnestly.”\
10:09\
How does one who was perfect\
pray more earnestly?\
10:15\
We assume that all of His\
prayers were earnest.\
10:18\
Yet in fulfilling His atoning\
sacrifice and through\
10:22\
the pain that attended\
its universal reach,\
10:27\
He felt to pray ever more\
pleadingly, with\
10:32\
the weight of His offering finally\
bringing blood from every pore.\
10:44\
Against that backdrop of Christ’s\
victory over death\
10:51\
and His recent gift to me of a few more\
weeks or months in mortality,\
10:57\
I bear solemn witness of the reality\
of eternal life and the need\
11:03\
for us to be serious in\
our planning for it.\
11:08\
That serious needs to exist\
when Christ comes.\
11:14\
Because He needs to recognize us—\
11:17\
not as nominal members, listed\
on a faded baptismal record,\
11:23\
but as thoroughly committed, faithfully\
believing, covenant-keeping disciples.\
11:28\
This is an urgent matter for all of us,\
11:33\
lest we ever hear with devastating\
regret, “I never knew you.”\
11:40\
Or as Joseph Smith translated that\
phrase, “You never knew me.”\
11:47\
Fortunately, we have help for\
this task. Lots of help.\
11:52\
We need to believe in angels and\
miracles and the promises of\
11:56\
the holy priesthood. We need to believe\
in the gift of the Holy Ghost,\
12:00\
the influence of good families\
and friends, and\
12:03\
the power of the pure love of Christ.\
12:06\
We need to believe in revelation\
and prophets,\
12:09\
seers, and revelators, and President\
Russell M. Nelson.\
12:13\
We need to believe that with prayer and\
pleading and personal righteousness,\
12:17\
we really can ascend to “Mount Zion,\
the city of the living God,\
12:23\
the heavenly place, the holiest of all.”\
12:28\
Brothers and sisters, as we repent\
of our sins and come boldly to\
12:34\
the “throne of grace,” leaving\
before Him there our alms\
12:38\
and our heartfelt supplications,\
12:41\
we will find mercy and compassion\
and forgiveness\
12:48\
at the benevolent hands of our Eternal\
Father and His obedient,\
12:53\
perfectly pure Son. Then, with Job\
and all the refined faithful,\
13:02\
we will behold a world too wonderful\
to understand.\
13:10\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
