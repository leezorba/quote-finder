As my two youngest children\
were growing,\
0:03\
I discovered books that were\
entertaining and engaging,\
0:07\
but also used symbolism in their\
stories. As we read together in\
0:12\
the evenings, I loved helping my\
children understand the symbolism\
0:16\
the author was using to teach deeper\
principles, even gospel principles.\
0:23\
I knew this was sinking in one day when\
my younger son was in his early teens.\
0:28\
He had started a new book and just\
wanted to enjoy the story,\
0:32\
but his mind kept trying to find\
0:35\
the deeper meaning in everything\
he was reading.\
0:38\
He was frustrated, but\
I was smiling inside.\
0:43\
Jesus taught through stories and\
symbols—a mustard seed to teach\
0:49\
the power of faith, a lost sheep\
to teach the worth of souls,\
0:53\
a prodigal son to teach\
the character of God.\
0:58\
His parables were symbols through which\
He could teach deeper lessons to those\
1:03\
who had “ears to hear.” But\
those not seeking\
1:07\
the deeper meaning would not understand,\
1:10\
just as many who read those same books\
1:13\
I read to my children never knew\
there were deeper meanings and\
1:17\
so much more to get out\
of those stories.\
1:21\
When God the Father offered His Only\
Begotten Son as a sacrifice for us,\
1:27\
Jesus Christ Himself became\
1:29\
the highest symbol of our Father in\
Heaven’s undying love for each of us.\
1:35\
Jesus Christ became the Lamb of God.\
1:39\
We have the privilege and blessing\
of being invited into\
1:43\
a covenant relationship with God,\
1:45\
in which our own lives can become\
a symbol of that covenant.\
1:50\
Covenants create the kind of\
relationship that allows God to mold\
1:55\
and change us over time, and lift us\
to become more like the Savior,\
2:00\
drawing us closer and closer\
to Him and our Father,\
2:04\
and eventually preparing us\
to enter Their presence.\
2:08\
Each person on earth is a beloved\
son or daughter of God.\
2:13\
When we choose to be part of a covenant,\
2:17\
it enhances and deepens our\
relationship with Him.\
2:21\
President Russell M. Nelson has taught\
that when we choose to make covenants\
2:27\
with God, our relationship with Him can\
become much closer than it was before\
2:32\
our covenant, and it enables\
Him to bless us with\
2:36\
an extra measure of His mercy and love,\
2:39\
a covenantal love referred to as\
“hesed” in the Hebrew language.\
2:45\
The covenant path is all about\
our relationship with God—\
2:50\
our hesed relationship with Him.\
2:53\
Our Father wants a deeper relationship\
with all His sons and daughters,\
2:58\
but it is our choice. As we choose\
to draw nearer to Him through\
3:03\
a covenant relationship, it allows\
Him to draw nearer to us\
3:08\
and more fully bless us. God sets the\
conditions and obligations of\
3:14\
the covenants we make. When we choose\
to enter into that relationship,\
3:19\
we witness to Him through\
3:21\
the symbolic actions of each covenant\
that we are willing to abide by\
3:26\
the conditions He has set.\
3:29\
Through honoring our covenants,\
3:31\
we enable God to pour out\
3:33\
the multitude of promised blessings\
associated with those covenants,\
3:37\
including increased power to change\
and become more like our Savior.\
3:43\
Jesus Christ is at the center\
of all covenants we make,\
3:47\
and covenant blessings\
are made possible\
3:50\
because of His atoning sacrifice.\
3:53\
Baptism by immersion is the symbolic\
gate through which we enter into\
3:58\
a covenant relationship with God.\
4:00\
Being immersed in the water and\
coming up again is symbolic of\
4:05\
the Savior's death and resurrection\
to new life.\
4:09\
As we are baptized, we symbolically\
die and are born again into\
4:15\
the family of Christ and show we are\
willing to take His name upon us.\
4:21\
We ourselves embody that covenant\
symbolism. In the New Testament\
4:26\
we read, “For as many of you as have\
been baptized into Christ have put\
4:32\
on Christ.” With our baptism, we\
symbolically put on Christ.\
4:38\
The ordinance of the sacrament\
also points to the Savior.\
4:42\
The bread and water is symbolic of\
Christ's flesh and blood shed for us.\
4:46\
The gift of His Atonement is\
symbolically offered to us each week\
4:51\
as a priesthood holder, representing the\
Savior Himself, offers us the bread\
4:57\
and water. As we perform the action\
of eating and drinking\
5:00\
the emblems of His flesh and blood,\
5:03\
Christ symbolically becomes\
a part of us.\
5:07\
We again put on Christ as we make\
a new covenant each week.\
5:12\
As we make covenants with God\
in the house of the Lord,\
5:16\
we further deepen our relationship\
with Him.\
5:19\
Everything we do in the temple points\
to our Father’s plan for us,\
5:24\
at the heart of which is the Savior\
and His atoning sacrifice.\
5:29\
The Lord will teach us, line upon line,\
5:31\
through the symbolism of the\
ordinances and covenants,\
5:35\
as we open our hearts and prayerfully\
seek to understand the deeper meanings.\
5:41\
As part of the temple endowment,\
5:43\
we are authorized to wear the garment\
of the holy priesthood.\
5:48\
It is both a sacred obligation\
and a sacred privilege.\
5:53\
In many religious traditions,\
5:55\
special outer clothing is worn as\
a symbol of a person's beliefs\
5:59\
and commitment to God, and ceremonial\
clothing is often worn by those leading\
6:04\
worship services. Those sacred\
vestments carry deep meaning\
6:09\
for those who wear them. We read in\
scripture that in ancient times,\
6:14\
sacred ceremonial clothing was also worn\
in conjunction with temple rituals.\
6:20\
As members of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints,\
6:24\
those of us who have chosen to make\
covenants with God in the house of\
6:28\
the Lord wear sacred ceremonial outer\
clothing during temple worship,\
6:34\
symbolic of the clothing worn\
in ancient temple rituals.\
6:38\
We also wear the garment\
of the holy priesthood,\
6:42\
both during temple worship and\
in our everyday lives.\
6:46\
The garment of the holy priesthood is\
deeply symbolic and also points to\
6:52\
the Savior. When Adam and Eve partook\
of the fruit and had to leave\
6:56\
the Garden of Eden, they were given\
coats of skins as a covering for them.\
7:02\
It is likely that an animal was\
sacrificed to make those coats of skins,\
7:07\
symbolic of the Savior's\
own sacrifice for us.\
7:11\
“Kaphar” is the basic Hebrew\
word for atonement,\
7:15\
and one of its meanings is “to cover.”\
7:19\
Our temple garment reminds\
us that the Savior and\
7:24\
the blessings of His Atonement cover\
us throughout our lives.\
7:29\
As we put on the garment\
of the holy priesthood\
7:32\
each day, that beautiful symbol\
becomes a part of us.\
7:38\
In the New Testament book of Romans,\
we read, “The night is far spent,\
7:43\
the day is at hand: let us therefore\
cast off the works of darkness\
7:48\
and let us put on the armour of light.\
... Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.”\
7:57\
I am so grateful for the privilege\
of wearing the garment of\
8:01\
the holy priesthood, to remind\
me that the Savior and\
8:06\
the blessings of His infinite Atonement\
constantly cover me throughout my\
8:11\
mortal journey. It also reminds me\
that as I keep the covenants\
8:16\
I have made with God in\
the house of the Lord,\
8:19\
I have symbolically put on Christ,\
who Himself is an armor of light.\
8:26\
He will protect me from evil, give\
me power and increased capacity,\
8:32\
and be my light and guide\
through the darkness\
8:34\
and difficulties of this world.\
8:37\
There is deep and beautiful symbolic\
meaning in the garment of\
8:41\
the Holy priesthood and its\
relationship to Christ.\
8:46\
I believe that my willingness to wear\
8:49\
the holy garment becomes\
my symbol to Him.\
8:53\
It is my own personal sign to God,\
not a sign to others.\
8:59\
I am so grateful for my Savior,\
Jesus Christ.\
9:02\
His atoning sacrifice for us became\
the greatest symbol of His\
9:08\
and our Father in Heaven’s infinite\
love for each of us,\
9:12\
with the tangible symbols of\
that love and sacrifice—\
9:16\
the marks in the Savior's hands, feet,\
9:20\
and side—remaining even after\
His resurrection.\
9:25\
By keeping my covenants and\
obligations with God,\
9:29\
including wearing the garment\
of the holy priesthood,\
9:32\
my very life can become a personal\
symbol of my love and deep gratitude\
9:39\
for my Savior, Jesus Christ, and my\
desire to have Him with me always.\
9:47\
If you have not yet done so,\
9:49\
I invite you to choose a deeper\
relationship with God by making\
9:53\
covenants with Him in the\
house of the Lord.\
9:56\
Study the talks of our Prophet,\
9:59\
including the beautiful teachings\
in the footnotes of his talks,\
10:03\
which most conference talks have.\
10:06\
He has spoken repeatedly about\
covenants for years\
10:10\
and especially since becoming\
President of the Church.\
10:14\
Learn from his teachings about\
the beautiful blessings\
10:18\
and increased power and capacity that\
can be yours through making\
10:22\
and keeping covenants with God.\
10:25\
The General Handbook states that it is\
not required to have a mission call\
10:30\
or be engaged to be married\
10:31\
to make temple covenants. A person\
must be at least 18 years old,\
10:36\
no longer be attending high\
school or the equivalent,\
10:40\
and be a member of the Church\
for at least one year.\
10:43\
There are also standards of personal\
holiness required.\
10:47\
If you have the desire to deepen your\
relationship with your Father in Heaven\
10:52\
and Jesus Christ by making sacred\
covenants in the house of the Lord,\
10:57\
I invite you to speak with your\
bishop or branch president\
11:00\
and let him know of your desires.\
11:03\
He will help you know how\
to prepare to receive\
11:07\
and honor those covenants. Through a\
covenant relationship with God,\
11:12\
our own lives can become a living symbol\
of our commitment and deep love\
11:19\
for our Father in Heaven,\
our hesed for Him,\
11:23\
and our desire to progress and\
eventually become like our Savior,\
11:27\
being prepared to one day\
enter Their presence,\
11:31\
I testify that the great blessings of\
that covenant relationship are well\
11:37\
worth the price. In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
