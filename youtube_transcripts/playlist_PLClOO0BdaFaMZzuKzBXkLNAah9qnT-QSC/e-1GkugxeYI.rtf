Thank you, dear President Eyring.\
We all love you dearly.\
0:13\
Brothers, sisters, and friends\
across the world,\
0:17\
I am honored to address\
this vast audience,\
0:20\
many of whom are members of our Church\
and many of whom are friends\
0:25\
and new listeners to this conference\
broadcast. Welcome.\
0:31\
The messages from this pulpit\
are communicated in words.\
0:35\
They are given in English\
0:37\
and translated into nearly\
100 different languages.\
0:42\
Always the base is the same: Words.\
And words matter a lot.\
0:49\
Let me say that again. Words matter.\
They are the bedrock of how we connect.\
0:56\
They represent our beliefs, morals,\
and perspectives.\
1:00\
Sometimes we speak words. Other times\
we listen. Words set a tone.\
1:07\
They voice our thoughts, feelings,\
and experiences for good or bad.\
1:14\
Unfortunately, words can be thoughtless,\
hasty, and hurtful.\
1:20\
Once said, we cannot take them back.\
1:23\
They can wound, punish, cut down, and\
even lead to destructive actions.\
1:30\
They can weigh heavily on us.\
1:34\
On the other hand, words can celebrate\
victory, be hopeful and encouraging.\
1:40\
They can prompt us to rethink, reboot,\
and redirect our course.\
1:45\
Words can open our minds to truth.\
1:49\
That is why, first and foremost,\
the Lord's words matter.\
1:56\
In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Alma\
1:58\
and his people in ancient America\
encountered endless warfare with those\
2:05\
who had disregarded the word of God,\
2:08\
hardened their hearts, and\
corrupted their culture.\
2:12\
The faithful could have fought, but\
Alma counseled, “And now as\
2:18\
the preaching of the word had\
a great tendency to lead\
2:21\
the people to do that which was just—\
2:24\
yea, it had had more powerful effect\
upon the minds of the people than\
2:29\
the sword, or anything else, which\
had happened unto them—\
2:34\
therefore Alma thought it was expedient\
that they should try the virtue of\
2:40\
the word of God.” The word of God\
surpasses all other expressions.\
2:46\
It has been so since the\
creation of the earth\
2:50\
when the Lord spoke, “Let there be\
light: and there was light.”\
2:55\
From the Savior came these assurances\
in the New Testament:\
3:00\
“Heaven and earth shall pass away, but\
my words shall not pass away.”\
3:05\
And this: “If a man love me,\
he will keep my words:\
3:10\
and my Father will love him,\
3:13\
and we will come unto him, and\
make our abode with him.”\
3:17\
And from Mary, the mother of Jesus,\
came this humble testimony:\
3:23\
“Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be\
it unto me according to thy word.”\
3:30\
Believing and heeding the word of\
God will draw us closer to Him.\
3:35\
President Russell M. Nelson has\
promised, “If you will study His words,\
3:40\
your ability to be more like Him will\
increase.” Don’t we all want to be, as\
3:47\
the hymn says, “More blessed and holy—\
More, Savior, like thee.”\
3:54\
I picture young Joseph\
Smith on his knees,\
3:58\
hearing the words of his Father in\
Heaven, “Joseph, this is my Beloved Son.\
4:04\
Hear Him.” We hear Him in\
the words of scripture,\
4:09\
but do we just let them sit on the page,\
4:13\
or do we recognize He is speaking\
to us? Do we change?\
4:18\
We hear Him in personal revelation\
and promptings from\
4:23\
the Holy Ghost in answers to prayer,\
4:26\
and those moments when\
only Jesus Christ,\
4:29\
through the power of His Atonement,\
can lift our burdens,\
4:33\
grant us forgiveness and peace, and\
embrace us in the arms of His love.\
4:41\
Second, the words of prophets matter.\
4:44\
Prophets testify of the divinity\
of Jesus Christ.\
4:48\
They teach His gospel and\
show His love for all.\
4:53\
I bear my witness that our living\
Prophet, President Russell M. Nelson,\
4:58\
hears and speaks the word of the Lord.\
President Nelson has a way with words.\
5:05\
He has said, “Keep on the covenant\
path,” “Gather Israel,” “Let God\
5:11\
prevail,” “Build bridges of\
understanding,” “Give thanks,” “Increase\
5:18\
faith in Jesus Christ,” “Take charge of\
your  testimony,” and “Become a\
5:23\
peacemaker.” Most recently, he has asked\
us to “Think Celestial!”\
5:29\
“When you’re confronted with\
a dilemma,” he said,\
5:32\
“think celestial! When tested\
by temptation,\
5:36\
think celestial! When life or\
loved ones let you down,\
5:41\
think celestial! When someone\
dies prematurely,\
5:46\
think celestial. When the pressures\
of life crowd in upon you,\
5:51\
think celestial. ... As you\
think celestial\
5:55\
your heart will gradually\
change. ... You will view\
5:58\
trials and opposition in a new light ...\
[and] your faith will increase.”\
6:05\
When we think celestial, we see\
things as they really are\
6:10\
and really will be. In this world\
burdened with confusion and contention,\
6:16\
we all need that perspective.\
6:20\
Elder George Albert Smith, long before\
becoming President of the Church,\
6:25\
spoke of sustaining the prophet\
and heeding his words.\
6:29\
He said, “The obligation that we make\
when we raise our hands ... is\
6:35\
a most sacred one. ... It means that\
we will stand behind him; we\
6:39\
will pray for him; ... and we will\
strive to carry out his instructions\
6:44\
as the Lord shall direct.”\
6:47\
In other words, we will diligently\
act upon our Prophet’s words.\
6:53\
As one of 15 prophets, seers,\
6:56\
and revelators sustained yesterday\
by our worldwide Church,\
7:01\
I want to share with you one of my\
experiences sustaining the Prophet\
7:06\
and embracing his words. It was for me\
7:11\
much like the prophet\
Jacob, who recounted,\
7:15\
“I had heard the voice of the Lord\
speaking unto me in very word.”\
7:21\
Last October, my wife, Melanie, and\
I were in Bangkok, Thailand,\
7:26\
as we were preparing to dedicate what\
would be the Church’s 185th temple.\
7:33\
For me, the assignment was both\
surreal and humbling.\
7:37\
This was the first house of the Lord\
on the Southeast Asia Peninsula.\
7:43\
It was masterfully designed—a six-story,\
7:47\
nine-spired structure fitly framed\
to be a house of the Lord.\
7:53\
For months I had contemplated\
the dedication.\
7:57\
What had settled in my soul and\
mind was that the country and\
8:01\
the temple had been cradled in the\
arms of apostles and prophets.\
8:08\
President Thomas S. Monson\
had announced the temple,\
8:12\
and President Nelson the dedication.\
8:15\
I had prepared the dedicatory\
prayer months earlier.\
8:20\
Those sacred words had been translated\
into 12 languages.\
8:24\
We were ready, or so I thought.\
8:29\
The night before the dedication,\
8:30\
I was awakened from my sleep\
with an unsettled,\
8:34\
urgent feeling about the\
dedicatory prayer.\
8:37\
I tried to set it aside, put\
that prompting away.\
8:42\
But the Spirit would not leave me alone.\
8:46\
I sensed certain words were missing,\
8:49\
and by divine design they came\
to me in revelation\
8:52\
and I inserted these words in\
the prayer near the end:\
8:57\
“May we think celestial, letting Thy\
Spirit prevail in our lives\
9:03\
and strive to be peacemakers always.”\
9:08\
The Lord was reminding me to heed\
the words of our living Prophet:“Think\
9:14\
celestial,” “Let the Spirit prevail,”\
“Strive to be peacemakers.”\
9:21\
Words of the prophet matter to the\
Lord and to us. Now third,\
9:29\
and so very important,\
are our own words.\
9:33\
Believe me, in our emoji-filled world,\
our words matter.\
9:40\
Our words can be supportive\
or angry, joyful or mean,\
9:44\
compassionate or tossed aside.\
In the heat of the moment\
9:48\
words can sting and sink painfully deep\
into the soul and stay there.\
9:55\
Our words on the internet,\
9:57\
texting, social media, or tweets\
take on a life of their own.\
10:02\
So be careful what you say\
and how you say it.\
10:06\
In our families, especially with\
husbands and wives and children,\
10:11\
our words can bring us together\
or drive a wedge between us.\
10:17\
Let me suggest three simple phrases\
that we can use to take\
10:21\
the sting out of difficulties\
and differences,\
10:24\
lift, and reassure each other, “Thank\
you,” “I am sorry,” and “I love you.”\
10:32\
Do not save these humble phrases for\
a special event or catastrophe.\
10:38\
Use them often and sincerely, for\
they show regard for others.\
10:43\
Talk is growing cheap. Do\
not follow that pattern.\
10:47\
We can say “thank you” on the elevator,\
in the parking lot, at the market,\
10:52\
or in the office, in a queue, or\
with our neighbors or friends.\
10:57\
We can say “I am sorry” when we make\
a mistake, miss a meeting,\
11:01\
forget a birthday, or see someone\
in pain. We can say “I love you,”\
11:07\
and those words carry the message, “I’m\
thinking about you,” “I care about you,”\
11:12\
“I am here for you,” or “You are\
everything to me.” Let me share a\
11:20\
personal example. Husbands, take heed\
and sisters, this is going to help you\
11:24\
too. Before my full-time assignment\
in the Church,\
11:27\
I traveled widely for my company.\
11:30\
I was gone a fair amount of time\
to far reaches of the world.\
11:35\
At the end of my day, no matter where\
I was, I always called home.\
11:43\
When my wife, Melanie, picked up\
the phone and I reported in,\
11:49\
our conversation always led to\
expressing “I love you” every day.\
11:56\
Those words served as an anchor\
to my soul and my conduct.\
12:01\
They were a protection to me from evil\
designs. “Melanie, I love you”\
12:07\
spoke of the precious trust between us.\
12:10\
President Thomas S. Monson used to say,\
“There are feet to steady,\
12:15\
hands to grasp, minds to inspire,\
and souls to save.”\
12:20\
Saying “Thank you,” “I am sorry,” “I\
love you” will do just that.\
12:25\
Brothers and sisters, words do matter.\
12:29\
I promise that if we “feast upon\
12:32\
the words of Christ” that\
lead to salvation,\
12:36\
our Prophet’s words that\
guide and encourage us,\
12:39\
and our own words that speak of who\
we are and what we hold dear,\
12:44\
the powers of heaven will\
pour down upon us.\
12:48\
“The words of Christ will tell you\
all things what you should do.”\
12:52\
We are His children, and He is our God.\
12:56\
And He expects us to speak with the\
tongue of angels by the power of\
13:01\
the Holy Ghost. I love the\
Lord Jesus Christ.\
13:06\
He is, in the words of the Old\
Testament prophet Isaiah,\
13:10\
“Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God,\
the everlasting Father,\
13:16\
the Prince of Peace.” And as the\
Apostle John made clear,\
13:22\
Jesus Christ Himself is the Word.\
13:27\
Of this I testify as an\
apostle called to\
13:31\
the Lord’s divine service to declare\
His word and called to stand as\
13:36\
a special witness of Him in the name of\
the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
