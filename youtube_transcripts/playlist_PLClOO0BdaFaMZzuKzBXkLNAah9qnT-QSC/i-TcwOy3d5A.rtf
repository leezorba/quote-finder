This evening, I speak to the\
youth of the Church,\
0:04\
the rising generation of young\
men and young women who are\
0:08\
the standard bearers for\
the next generation.\
0:11\
In October 2013, our beloved Prophet,\
President Russell M. Nelson, declared,\
0:18\
quote, “Your Heavenly Father has known\
you for a very long time.\
0:24\
You, as His son or daughter,\
0:26\
were chosen by Him to come to the\
earth at this precise time to be\
0:32\
a leader in His great work on earth.”\
0:36\
Two years ago, President\
Nelson continued,\
0:39\
“Today I reaffirm strongly that the\
Lord has asked every worthy,\
0:44\
able young man to prepare\
for and serve a mission.\
0:49\
For Latter-day Saint young men,\
0:50\
missionary service is a priesthood\
responsibility.\
0:53\
You young men have been reserved\
for this time when\
0:57\
the promised gathering of\
Israel is taking place.\
1:01\
For you young and able sisters,\
1:03\
a mission is also a powerful\
but optional opportunity.\
1:08\
Pray to know if the Lord would\
have you serve a mission,\
1:12\
and the Holy Ghost will respond to\
your heart and mind.” Close quote.\
1:19\
Our prophet's references to the Lord\
holding the youth of our day in reserve\
1:24\
for this time in the gathering of Israel\
and His invitation to pray\
1:29\
to know what the Lord would have you do,\
1:31\
are in part references\
to the life you lived\
1:36\
and blessings you received from God\
before you were ever born on this earth.\
1:42\
All of us who are born on this earth\
first lived with our Heavenly Father\
1:47\
as His spirit children. The\
Lord declared to Moses, “I,\
1:52\
the Lord God, created all things\
spiritually before they were naturally\
1:58\
upon the face of the earth.”\
2:00\
When he created you spiritually,\
He loved you as His spirit\
2:06\
sons and daughters, and embedded within\
each of you a divine nature\
2:11\
and eternal destiny. During\
your premortal life,\
2:15\
“you developed your identity\
2:17\
and increased your spiritual\
capabilities.”\
2:21\
You were blessed with\
the gift of agency,\
2:24\
the ability to make choices\
for yourself.\
2:28\
And you did make important decisions,\
2:30\
such as the decision to follow our\
Heavenly Father's plan of happiness,\
2:35\
which is “to obtain a physical body and\
gain earthly experience to progress ...\
2:42\
and ultimately realize [your] divine\
destiny as heirs of eternal life.”\
2:49\
This decision affected your life\
then, in your premortal life,\
2:53\
and it continues to affect\
your life now. As\
2:58\
a child of God living in\
your premortal life,\
3:02\
you “grew in intelligence and you\
learned to love the truth.”\
3:07\
Before you were born, God appointed\
each of you to fulfill specific\
3:11\
missions during your mortal\
life upon this earth.\
3:16\
If you remain worthy, the blessings of\
that premortal decree will enable you\
3:21\
to have all kinds of opportunities\
in this life,\
3:26\
including opportunities to serve in\
the Church and to participate in\
3:29\
the most important work happening\
on the earth today,\
3:34\
the gathering of Israel. Those\
premortal promises\
3:39\
and blessings are called\
your “foreordination.”\
3:43\
The doctrine of foreordination applies\
to all members of the Church.\
3:48\
Foreordination does not guarantee that\
you will receive certain callings\
3:52\
or responsibilities. Those blessings\
and opportunities come in this life\
3:57\
as a result of your righteous\
exercise of agency,\
4:02\
just as your foreordination in\
your premortal life came as\
4:07\
a result of righteousness.\
4:09\
As you prove yourself worthy and\
progress along the covenant path,\
4:14\
you will receive opportunities to\
serve in your Young Women class\
4:17\
or priesthood quorum. You will be\
blessed to serve in the temple,\
4:23\
to become a ministering\
brother or sister,\
4:26\
and to serve a mission as a\
disciple of Jesus Christ.\
4:31\
Why does it matter to seek to know and\
understand your foreordination?\
4:37\
In a day when questions abound,\
4:41\
when so many seek to know\
their true identity,\
4:46\
the fact that God knows and has blessed\
each one of us individually before\
4:52\
we were ever born on this earth\
4:54\
with “essential characteristic[s] of ...\
premortal, mortal, and eternal identity\
5:02\
and purpose” brings sweet peace and\
assurance to our mind and our heart.\
5:09\
Knowing who you are begins with\
understanding God's foreordained\
5:13\
blessings bestowed upon you before\
you were ever born on this earth.\
5:18\
Our Heavenly Father desires to reveal\
to you your personal foreordination,\
5:23\
and He will do so as you seek to\
learn and follow His will.\
5:28\
I love to read President Nelson's\
Instagram posts.\
5:32\
One of my favorites was\
on July 20, 2022.\
5:36\
He wrote, “I believe that if the Lord\
were speaking to you directly,\
5:41\
the first thing He would make sure you\
understand is your true identity.\
5:47\
My dear friends, you are literally\
spirit children of God. ...\
5:51\
Make no mistake about it: your\
potential is divine. With\
5:55\
your diligent seeking, God will give\
you glimpses of who you may become.”\
6:02\
May I share with you how my earthly\
father taught me to discover my\
6:06\
identity and God’s plan in my life?\
6:11\
One Saturday morning when\
I was 13 years old,\
6:14\
I was mowing the grass as part\
of my weekly chores.\
6:18\
When I finished, I heard the door\
close at the back of our house\
6:23\
and looked to see my father\
calling me to join him.\
6:28\
I walked to the back porch, and he\
invited me to sit with him on\
6:32\
the steps. It was a beautiful morning.\
6:36\
I still recall him sitting so close\
that our shoulders were touching.\
6:42\
He began by telling me he loved me. He\
asked me what my goals were in life.\
6:48\
I thought, “Well, that’s easy.”\
I knew two things for sure.\
6:53\
I wanted to be taller and I wanted to go\
camping more. I was a simple soul.\
7:02\
He smiled and paused for a\
moment and said, “Steve,\
7:06\
I'd like to share something with you\
that's very important to me.\
7:11\
I've prayed that our Heavenly\
Father will cause what\
7:15\
I say now to be indelibly imprinted\
on your mind and on your soul,\
7:22\
so that you’ll never forget.” My father\
had my full attention in that moment.\
7:28\
He turned to me, looked me in\
the eyes and said, “Son,\
7:35\
protect the private times of your life.”\
7:40\
There was a long pause as he let the\
meaning sink deep into my heart.\
7:44\
He then continued, “You know those times\
when you’re the only one around\
7:48\
and no one else knows\
what you’re doing?\
7:51\
Those times when you think whatever I\
do now doesn't affect anyone else,\
7:55\
only me?” Then he said, “More than\
any other time in your life,\
8:03\
what you do during the private times of\
your life will have the greatest impact\
8:09\
on how you confront challenges\
and heartache you will face.\
8:13\
And what you do during the private\
times of your life will have\
8:17\
a greater impact on how\
you confront successes\
8:20\
and joy you will experience than\
any other time in your life.”\
8:25\
My father received the\
wish of his heart.\
8:30\
The sound and cadence of his voice,\
8:33\
the love I felt in his words, were\
indelibly imprinted in my mind and\
8:40\
on my soul that day. I have learned\
over the years that\
8:44\
the greatest miracle of that day on\
the steps of my childhood home,\
8:48\
was that in the private\
times of my life,\
8:52\
I could go to God in prayer\
to receive revelation.\
8:57\
My father was teaching me how\
8:59\
I could learn of God’s foreordained\
blessings. In those private moments\
9:03\
I learned the Book of Mormon\
is the word of God.\
9:07\
I learned God had foreordained\
me to serve a mission.\
9:12\
And I learned that God knows me, and\
He hears and answers my prayers.\
9:16\
I learned that Jesus is the Christ,\
our Savior and our Redeemer.\
9:22\
Though I have made many mistakes since\
that memorable day with my father,\
9:28\
striving to protect the private times of\
my life has remained an anchor amid\
9:33\
the storms of life and has enabled me\
to seek safe haven and the healing,\
9:38\
strengthening blessings of our Savior's\
love and atoning sacrifice.\
9:43\
My young brothers and sisters,\
9:44\
as you protect the private times of your\
life with wholesome recreation,\
9:49\
listening to uplifting music, reading\
the scriptures, having regular\
9:53\
meaningful prayer, and making\
efforts to receive\
9:57\
and ponder your patriarchal blessing,\
you will receive revelation.\
10:01\
In President Nelson's words,\
10:03\
your eyes will become “wide open to the\
truth that this life really is\
10:07\
the time when you get to decide what\
kind of life you want to live forever.”\
10:13\
Our Heavenly Father will\
answer your prayers,\
10:16\
especially your prayers offered during\
the private times of your life.\
10:21\
He will reveal to you your foreordained\
gifts, talents, and blessings.\
10:26\
You will feel His love envelop\
you if you will sincerely ask\
10:31\
and genuinely desire to know.\
10:34\
As you protect the private\
times of your life,\
10:36\
your participation in the ordinances\
and covenants of\
10:40\
the gospel will be more meaningful,\
10:42\
and you will more fully bind\
yourself to God in\
10:46\
the covenants you make with Him,\
10:47\
and you will be lifted to have\
greater hope, faith,\
10:50\
and assurance in the promises\
God has made to you.\
10:54\
Do you want to know God’s plan for you?\
I bear witness He wants you to know.\
11:00\
And He’s inspired His prophet to\
the world to invite you to pray\
11:04\
and receive this eye-opening experience.\
11:07\
I bear witness of the truth of these\
things and the reality of Jesus Christ.\
11:12\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
