Good morning dear friends,\
sisters and brothers.\
0:06\
In the Pieper family we sometimes play a\
game we call “The Crazy Trust Exercise.”\
0:13\
You may have played it too.\
0:15\
Two people stand a few feet apart, one\
with their back toward the other.\
0:21\
On a signal from the person behind,\
0:23\
the person in front falls backward into\
the waiting arms of their friend.\
0:28\
Trust is the foundation\
of all relationships.\
0:33\
A threshold question to any relationship\
is, “Can I trust\
0:38\
the other person?” A relationship forms\
only when people are willing to place\
0:44\
trust in each other. It is not\
0:46\
a relationship if one person trusts\
completely, but the other does not.\
0:53\
Each of us is a beloved spirit son or\
daughter of a loving Heavenly Father.\
1:00\
But while that spiritual genealogy\
provides a foundation,\
1:05\
it does not of itself create a\
meaningful relationship with God.\
1:09\
A relationship can only be built\
when we choose to trust Him.\
1:15\
Heavenly Father desires to build\
1:17\
a close personal relationship with\
each of His spirit children.\
1:23\
Jesus expressed that desire when He\
prayed, “That they all may be one;\
1:29\
as thou, Father, art in me, and I in\
thee, that they also may be one in us.”\
1:38\
The relationship God seeks with each\
spirit child is one so close\
1:44\
and personal that He will be able to\
share all He has and all He is.\
1:51\
That kind of deep, enduring relationship\
can develop only when\
1:56\
built upon perfect, total trust.\
2:00\
For His part, Heavenly Father\
has worked from\
2:03\
the beginning to communicate\
His absolute trust in\
2:07\
the divine potential of\
each of His children.\
2:10\
Trust underlies the plan He\
presented for our growth\
2:13\
and progression prior\
to coming to Earth.\
2:17\
He would teach us eternal laws, create\
an earth, provide us with mortal bodies,\
2:24\
give us the gift to choose\
for ourselves,\
2:26\
and permit us to learn and grow\
by making our own choices.\
2:31\
He wants us to choose\
to follow His laws\
2:34\
and return to enjoy eternal\
life with Him and His Son.\
2:40\
Knowing that we would not always\
make good choices,\
2:43\
He also prepared a way for us to escape\
from the consequences of bad choices.\
2:49\
He provided us a Savior—\
His Son, Jesus Christ—\
2:53\
to atone for our sins and make us clean\
again on condition of repentance.\
2:59\
He invites us to use the precious\
gift of repentance regularly.\
3:05\
Every parent knows how difficult\
it is to trust\
3:08\
a child enough to let them\
make their own decisions,\
3:12\
especially when the parent knows the\
child is likely to make mistakes\
3:17\
and suffer as a result. Yet,\
3:20\
Heavenly Father allows us to make\
3:23\
the choices that will help us reach our\
divine potential. As Elder Dale G.\
3:30\
Renlund taught, “[His] goal in parenting\
is not to have His children do what\
3:36\
is right; it is to have His children\
choose to do what is right\
3:41\
and ultimately become like Him.”\
3:46\
Notwithstanding God's trust in us,\
3:48\
our relationship with Him\
will grow only to\
3:51\
the degree we are willing to\
place our trust in Him.\
3:58\
The challenge is that we live in a\
fallen world and have all experienced\
4:02\
a betrayal of trust as the result of\
dishonesty, manipulation, coercion,\
4:08\
or other circumstances. Once betrayed,\
we may struggle to trust again.\
4:17\
These negative trust experiences with\
imperfect mortals may even impact\
4:23\
our willingness to trust in\
a perfect Heavenly Father.\
4:30\
Several years ago, two friends of mine,\
Leonid and Valentina,\
4:33\
expressed interest in becoming\
members of the Church.\
4:37\
As Leonid began to learn the gospel,\
he found it difficult to pray.\
4:44\
Earlier in his life, Leonid had\
suffered from manipulation\
4:47\
and control by superiors and had\
developed a distrust of authority.\
4:54\
These experiences affected his\
ability to open his heart\
4:58\
and express personal feelings\
to Heavenly Father.\
5:02\
With time and study, Leonid gained\
5:04\
a better understanding\
of God's character\
5:07\
and experienced feeling God's love.\
5:10\
Eventually, prayer became a natural\
way for him to express thanks and\
5:16\
the love he was feeling for God.\
5:19\
His increasing trust in\
God eventually led him\
5:22\
and Valentina to enter into\
sacred covenants,\
5:25\
to strengthen their relationship\
with God and each other.\
5:30\
If prior loss of trust is keeping\
you from trusting God,\
5:35\
please follow Leonid's example.\
5:38\
Patiently continue to learn about\
Heavenly Father, His character,\
5:44\
His attributes, and His purposes.\
5:47\
Look for and record experiences feeling\
His love and power in your life.\
5:53\
Our living Prophet, President Russell\
M. Nelson, has taught that\
5:58\
the more we learn about God,\
5:59\
the easier it will be\
for us to trust Him.\
6:04\
Sometimes the best way to learn to trust\
God is simply by trusting Him.\
6:11\
Like the “Crazy Trust Exercise,”\
6:14\
sometimes we just need to be willing to\
fall backward and let Him catch us.\
6:19\
Our mortal life is a test.\
6:22\
Challenges that stretch us beyond our\
own capacity come frequently.\
6:27\
When our knowledge and understanding\
are inadequate,\
6:31\
we naturally seek for resources to help\
us. In an information-saturated world,\
6:38\
there is no shortage of sources\
promoting their solutions to our\
6:42\
challenges. However, the simple,\
6:45\
time-tested counsel in Proverbs\
provides the best advice:\
6:50\
“Trust in the Lord\
with all thine heart.”\
6:55\
We show our trust in God by turning to\
Him first when confronted with life’s\
7:01\
challenges. After I finished\
law school in Utah,\
7:06\
our family faced the important decision\
of where to work and make our home.\
7:10\
After counseling with each\
other and the Lord,\
7:13\
we felt directed to move our family\
to the eastern United States,\
7:16\
far from parents and siblings.\
7:20\
Initially, things went well and we\
felt confirmed in our decision.\
7:25\
But then things changed. There was\
downsizing at the law firm,\
7:29\
and I faced the prospect of\
no job or insurance at\
7:33\
the very time our daughter\
Dora was born\
7:36\
with serious medical challenges\
and long-term special needs.\
7:41\
While confronting these challenges,\
7:43\
I was extended a call to serve that\
would require significant time\
7:47\
and commitment. I had never faced such\
a challenge and was overwhelmed.\
7:54\
I began to question the decision we had\
made and its accompanying confirmation.\
7:59\
We had trusted in the Lord and that\
things were supposed to work out.\
8:04\
I had fallen backwards, and it now\
appeared that no one was going to catch\
8:10\
me. One day the words “Don’t ask why;\
8:15\
ask what I want you to learn” came\
distinctly into my mind and heart.\
8:21\
Now I was even more confused.\
In the very moment\
8:25\
I was struggling with\
my earlier decision,\
8:28\
God was inviting me to\
trust Him even more.\
8:33\
Looking back, this was a critical\
point in my life.\
8:37\
It was a moment when I realized that\
8:40\
the best way to learn to trust God\
was simply by trusting Him.\
8:46\
In the subsequent weeks, I\
watched with amazement as\
8:51\
the Lord miraculously unfolded\
His plan to bless our family.\
8:58\
Good teachers and coaches know\
that intellectual growth\
9:02\
and physical strength can happen only\
when minds and muscles are stretched.\
9:08\
Likewise, God invites us to grow by\
trusting His spiritual tutoring through\
9:15\
soul-stretching experiences.\
9:18\
Therefore, we can be sure that whatever\
trust we may have demonstrated in\
9:24\
God in the past, another trust-\
stretching experience lies yet ahead.\
9:31\
God is focused on our\
growth and progress.\
9:35\
He is the master teacher,\
9:36\
the complete coach, who is always\
stretching us to help us realize more\
9:43\
of our divine potential. That\
will always include\
9:47\
a future invitation to trust\
Him just a little bit more.\
9:54\
The Book of Mormon teaches\
9:56\
the pattern God uses to stretch us in\
order to build strong relationships\
10:00\
with us. In Come, Follow Me,\
10:03\
we recently studied about how Nephi’s\
trust in God was tested when he\
10:07\
and his brothers were commanded to\
return to Jerusalem to obtain\
10:11\
the brass plates. After their\
initial attempts failed,\
10:16\
his brothers gave up and were ready\
to return without the plates.\
10:22\
But Nephi chose to place his\
complete trust in the Lord\
10:27\
and was successful in obtaining\
the plates.\
10:31\
That experience likely strengthened\
Nephi’s confidence in God\
10:35\
when his bow broke and the family was\
facing starvation in the wilderness.\
10:41\
Again Nephi chose to trust in\
God and the family was saved.\
10:47\
These successive experiences gave Nephi\
even stronger confidence in God\
10:52\
for the enormous, trust-stretching task\
he would soon face of building a ship.\
10:59\
Through these experiences,\
11:01\
Nephi strengthened His relationship\
with God by consistently\
11:05\
and continuously trusting Him. God\
uses the same pattern with us.\
11:12\
He extends us personal invitations to\
strengthen and deepen our trust in Him.\
11:17\
Each time we accept and act on an\
invitation, our trust in God grows.\
11:23\
If we ignore or decline an invitation,\
11:26\
our progress stops until we are ready\
to act on a new invitation.\
11:32\
The good news is that regardless\
of the trust\
11:35\
we may or may not have chosen\
to place in God in the past,\
11:40\
we can choose to trust God today\
and every day going forward.\
11:46\
I promise that each time we do,\
God will be there to catch us,\
11:53\
and our relationship of trust will\
grow stronger and stronger until\
11:59\
the day that we become one\
with Him and His Son.\
12:03\
Then we can declare as Nephi, “O Lord,\
I have trusted in thee,\
12:10\
and I will trust in thee forever.” In\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
