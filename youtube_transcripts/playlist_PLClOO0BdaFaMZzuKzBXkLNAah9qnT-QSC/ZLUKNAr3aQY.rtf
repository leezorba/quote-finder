I’ve had the great blessing of speaking\
at general conference for three decades\
0:07\
now. During that time, I've been asked\
questions relating to these messages\
0:13\
by many around the world. Lately, one\
particular question keeps coming up.\
0:19\
It usually goes something like this:\
0:23\
“Elder Uchtdorf, I listened carefully\
to your last talk, but ...\
0:28\
I didn’t hear anything about aviation.”\
0:34\
Well, after today, I hope I hear that\
question no more for a while.\
0:44\
It's hard to believe it was only\
120 years ago when Wilbur\
0:49\
and Orville Wright first lifted off and\
flew over the sands of Kitty Hawk,\
0:55\
North Carolina. Four short flights\
on that December day\
1:00\
changed the world and opened the door\
to one of the greatest inventions in\
1:06\
the world's history. Flying was\
risky in those early days.\
1:11\
The brothers knew this, and so\
did their father, Milton.\
1:15\
In fact, he was so terrified of\
losing both of his sons in\
1:21\
a flying accident that they promised\
him they would never fly together.\
1:26\
And they never did—with one exception.\
1:30\
Seven years after that historic\
day at Kitty Hawk,\
1:35\
Milton Wright finally gave his\
consent and watched as Wilbur\
1:40\
and Orville flew together\
for the first time.\
1:44\
After landing, Orville convinced\
his father to take his first\
1:49\
and only flight and to see for\
himself what it was like.\
1:54\
As the plane lifted from the ground,\
1:57\
the 82-year-old Milton\
got so caught up in\
2:01\
the exhilaration of flight\
that all fear left him.\
2:07\
Orville rejoiced as his father shouted\
with delight, “Higher, Orville. Higher!”\
2:15\
This was a man after my own heart.\
2:20\
Perhaps the reason I speak about\
aviation occasionally is that\
2:24\
I know something of what\
the Wrights felt.\
2:29\
I, too, have “slipped the surly bonds\
of earth and danced the skies\
2:36\
on laughter-silvered wings.”\
2:39\
The Wright brothers’ first flight,\
2:41\
which happened a mere 37 years before\
my birth, opened doors of adventure,\
2:49\
wonder, and pure joy into\
my life. And yet,\
2:54\
as amazing as that joy is,\
2:58\
there’s an even higher\
kind of joy. Today, in\
3:02\
the spirit of Milton Wright’s delighted\
cry, “Higher, Orville, higher,”\
3:09\
I would like to speak about this higher\
joy, where it comes from,\
3:14\
how it enters our hearts, and how we can\
experience it in greater measure.\
3:22\
It probably goes without saying that\
everyone wants to be happy.\
3:27\
Nevertheless, it goes also without\
saying that not everyone is happy.\
3:33\
Sadly, it seems that for many people,\
happiness is hard to find. Why is that?\
3:42\
If happiness is the one thing\
we humans desire most,\
3:48\
why are we so unsuccessful\
at finding it?\
3:52\
To paraphrase a country song,\
3:55\
maybe we've been looking for joy\
in all the wrong places.\
4:02\
Before we discuss how to find joy,\
4:06\
allow me to acknowledge that depression\
and other difficult mental\
4:10\
and emotional challenges are real.\
4:14\
And the answer is not simply,\
“Try to be happier.”\
4:18\
My purpose today is not to diminish or\
trivialize mental health issues.\
4:24\
If you face such challenges, I mourn\
with you and I stand beside you.\
4:31\
For some people, finding joy may include\
seeking help from trained\
4:35\
mental health professionals who devote\
their lives to practicing their very\
4:41\
important art. We should be\
thankful for such help.\
4:47\
Now,\
4:48\
life is not an endless sequence\
of emotional highs.\
4:53\
“For it must be that there is an\
opposition in all things.”\
4:57\
And if God Himself weeps, as the\
scriptures affirm He does,\
5:04\
then of course you and\
I will weep as well.\
5:08\
Feeling sad is not a sign of failure.\
5:12\
In this life at least, joy and sorrow\
are inseparable companions.\
5:19\
Like all of you, I have felt my share\
of disappointment, sorrow, sadness,\
5:25\
and remorse. However, I've also\
experienced for myself\
5:30\
the glorious dawn that fills\
the soul with joy\
5:34\
so profound that it can\
scarcely be kept in.\
5:38\
I have discovered for myself that this\
peaceful confidence comes from\
5:45\
following the Savior and\
walking in His way.\
5:49\
The peace He gives us is not like what\
the world gives. It’s better.\
5:56\
It’s higher and holier.\
Jesus said, “I am come\
6:03\
that they might have life, and they\
might have it more abundantly.”\
6:11\
The gospel of Jesus Christ is truly\
the “good news of great joy”!\
6:14\
It is a message of matchless hope, a\
message of yoke-bearing and burden-\
6:22\
lifting, of light-gathering, of heavenly\
favor, higher understanding,\
6:28\
holier covenants, eternal security,\
and everlasting glory!\
6:35\
Joy is the very purpose of God’s\
plan for His children.\
6:40\
It’s what you were created for—\
“that [you] might have joy.”\
6:45\
You were built for this. Our Father\
in Heaven has not hidden the\
6:50\
path to happiness. It’s not a secret.\
It’s available to all.\
6:55\
It is promised to those who walk\
the path of discipleship,\
6:59\
follow the teaching and example of the\
Savior, keep His commandments,\
7:03\
make and honor covenants they make with\
God. What a remarkable promise!\
7:11\
We all know people who say that they\
don't need God to be happy.\
7:17\
That they are happy enough\
without religion.\
7:20\
I acknowledge and respect\
these feelings.\
7:24\
Our beloved Father in Heaven wants all\
His children to have as much happiness\
7:29\
as possible. So He has filled\
this world with beautiful,\
7:32\
wholesome pleasures and delights,\
7:35\
“both to please the eye and\
gladden the heart.”\
7:39\
For me, flying brought great happiness.\
7:43\
Others find it in music, in art,\
in hobbies or nature.\
7:48\
By inviting everyone and sharing the\
Savior’s good news of great joy,\
7:56\
we do not discount only these sources\
of joy. Any of those.\
8:02\
We are simply saying that God has\
something more to give, a higher\
8:08\
and more profound joy, a joy that\
transcends anything this world offers.\
8:13\
It is a joy that endures\
8:14\
heartbreak, penetrates sorrow,\
and diminishes loneliness.\
8:20\
Worldly happiness, by contrast,\
does not last. It cannot.\
8:25\
It is the nature of all earthly\
things to grow old and decay,\
8:30\
wear out, or become stale. But godly joy\
8:37\
is eternal because God is eternal.\
8:41\
Jesus Christ came to lift\
us out of the temporal\
8:46\
and replace corruption\
with incorruption.\
8:49\
Only He has that power and only\
His joy is perpetual.\
8:58\
If you feel there could be more of\
this kind of joy in your life,\
9:01\
I invite you to embark on the journey of\
following Jesus Christ and His way.\
9:08\
It is a journey of a lifetime\
and beyond.\
9:14\
Please let me suggest a\
few beginning steps\
9:17\
on this worthy journey of\
discovering pure joy.\
9:23\
Do you remember the woman in the\
New Testament who endured\
9:30\
a bleeding illness for 12 years?\
9:34\
She had spent all she had on physicians,\
9:37\
but things only grew worse.\
She had heard of Jesus.\
9:41\
His power to heal was well known.\
But could He heal her?\
9:47\
And how could she even get near Him?\
9:50\
Her sickness made her unclean according\
to the law of Moses,\
9:54\
and therefore she was required\
to stay away from others.\
10:00\
Approaching Him openly and asking for\
healing seemed out of the question.\
10:06\
Still, she thought, “If I may touch\
but his clothes, I shall be whole.”\
10:16\
At last her faith overcame her fear.\
10:22\
She braved the censure of others\
and pressed toward the Savior.\
10:28\
Finally, she was within reach. She\
extended her hand and she was healed.\
10:36\
Aren't we all somewhat like this woman?\
10:41\
There may be many reasons why we\
hesitate to draw near to the Savior.\
10:49\
We may face ridicule or condemnation\
by others.\
10:56\
In our pride, we may dismiss the\
possibility of something\
11:00\
so simple being of so much value.\
11:05\
We may think that our condition somehow\
disqualifies us from His healing,\
11:12\
that the distance is too great or our\
sins too many. Like this woman,\
11:20\
I have learned that if we draw near\
to God and reach out to touch Him,\
11:28\
we can indeed find healing,\
peace, and joy.\
11:33\
Jesus taught, “Seek and ye shall find.”\
11:37\
I believe this simple phrase is\
not only a spiritual promise.\
11:43\
I believe it is a statement of fact.\
11:49\
If we seek reasons to be angry, to\
doubt, to be bitter or alone,\
11:54\
we will find them. However,\
if we seek joy,\
12:00\
if we look for reasons to rejoice and\
to happily follow the Savior,\
12:06\
we will find them too. We rarely find\
something we’re not looking for.\
12:14\
Are we looking for eternal joy? Seek\
and ye shall find.\
12:21\
Jesus taught, “It is more blessed\
to give than to receive.”\
12:27\
Can it be that in our search for joy,\
12:30\
the best way to find it is to\
bring joy to others?\
12:37\
Brothers and sisters, you know\
and I know this is true.\
12:42\
Joy is like a barrel of flour or a jar\
of oil that will never run out.\
12:48\
True joy multiplies when it is shared.\
12:53\
It doesn't require something\
grand or complicated.\
12:57\
We could do simple things like praying\
for someone with all our heart;\
13:02\
giving a sincere compliment; helping\
someone feel welcome, respected,\
13:07\
valued, and loved; sharing\
a favorite scripture\
13:13\
and what it really means to us;\
or even just by listening.\
13:19\
“When you are in the service\
of your fellow beings\
13:22\
you are only in the\
service of your God,”\
13:25\
and God will repay your\
kindness generously.\
13:30\
The joy you give to others will\
return to you in “good measure,\
13:34\
pressed down, and shaken together,\
and running over.”\
13:39\
During the coming days,\
weeks, and months,\
13:42\
may I invite you to:\
Spend time in a sincere,\
13:45\
full-hearted effort to draw near\
to God. Seek diligently\
13:50\
for everyday moments of hope, peace, and\
joy. Bring joy to others around you.\
14:01\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
14:03\
dear friends, as you search\
the word of God for\
14:06\
a deeper understanding of\
God's eternal plan,\
14:09\
accept these invitations, and\
strive to walk in His way,\
14:13\
you will experience “the peace of God,\
which passeth all understanding,”\
14:20\
even in the midst of sorrow.\
14:22\
You will feel a greater measure\
of God’s unsurpassable love\
14:26\
swelling within your heart.\
14:31\
The dawn of celestial light will\
penetrate the shadows of your trials,\
14:38\
and you will begin to taste the\
unspeakable glories and wonders of\
14:43\
the unseen, perfect heavenly sphere.\
14:47\
You will feel your spirit lifting away\
from the gravity of this world.\
14:53\
And like good Milton Wright,\
14:56\
perhaps you will raise your voice in\
rejoicing and shout, “Higher, Father.\
15:02\
Higher!” May we all seek and find\
15:06\
the higher joy that comes from devoting\
our lives to our Heavenly Father\
15:12\
and His Beloved Son. This is my\
earnest prayer and blessing,\
15:18\
in the sacred name of Jesus Christ,\
15:21\
amen.\
