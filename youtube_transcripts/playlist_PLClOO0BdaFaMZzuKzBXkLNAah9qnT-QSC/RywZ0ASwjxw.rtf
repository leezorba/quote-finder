My beloved brothers and sisters, this\
session of general conference\
0:06\
has been for me a sacred time.\
0:10\
I am grateful for the assignment\
to speak to\
0:14\
the millions of Latter-day Saints and\
our friends across the world.\
0:20\
I love you. And I know\
the Lord loves you.\
0:26\
Over 50 years ago, I had the\
privilege to serve as\
0:32\
the president of Ricks College\
in Rexburg, Idaho.\
0:38\
On the morning of June 5, 1976,\
0:43\
my wife, Kathy, and I drove\
from Rexburg to\
0:48\
the Idaho Falls Temple to attend\
the sealing of a close friend.\
0:56\
Of course, with four young boys\
in our home at the time,\
1:01\
our temple trip could be only\
accomplished with the help of\
1:06\
a courageous babysitter. We left our\
precious children in her care and made\
1:15\
the short 30-minute drive.\
1:19\
Our experience in the temple that day\
was wonderful, as it always was.\
1:27\
However, after the conclusion\
of the temple sealing\
1:32\
and as we were preparing to return home,\
1:37\
we noticed many temple workers and\
patrons nervously conversing in\
1:45\
the lobby of the temple. Within moments,\
1:50\
one of the temple workers told us that\
1:54\
the newly constructed Teton Dam in\
eastern Idaho had collapsed.\
2:02\
More than 80 billion gallons of water\
were flowing through the dam and into\
2:10\
the 300 square miles\
2:12\
of neighboring valleys. Much of the\
city of Rexburg was under water,\
2:20\
with homes and vehicles carried\
away by floodwaters.\
2:27\
Two thirds of the 9,000 residents\
were suddenly homeless.\
2:36\
As you might imagine, our thoughts and concerns turned to\
2:43\
the safety of our dear children,\
2:46\
hundreds of college students and\
faculty, and a community we loved.\
2:55\
We were less than 30 miles from home,\
2:59\
and yet, on this day, long before\
cell phones and text messaging,\
3:06\
we had no way of communicating\
immediately with our children.\
3:12\
Nor could we make the drive from\
Idaho Falls to Rexburg as all\
3:19\
the roads had been closed.\
3:23\
Our only option was to stay the night\
in a local motel in Idaho Falls.\
3:33\
Kathy and I knelt together\
in our motel room\
3:37\
and humbly pled with Heavenly Father\
for the safety of our dear children\
3:45\
and the thousands of others affected\
by the tragic event.\
3:52\
I recall Kathy pacing the floors\
into the early hours of\
3:56\
the morning with worry\
about her children.\
4:02\
Despite my own concerns, I was able to\
put my mind at ease and fall asleep.\
4:10\
It wasn't long thereafter that my sweet\
eternal companion woke me and said,\
4:18\
“Hal, how can you sleep\
at a time like this?”\
4:25\
These words then came clearly\
to my heart and mind,\
4:31\
and so I said to my wife, “Kathy,\
whatever the outcome, all will be well\
4:40\
because of the temple. We have made\
covenants with God and have been sealed\
4:47\
as an eternal family.”\
4:52\
At that moment, it was\
as if the Spirit of\
4:55\
the Lord confirmed in our hearts\
4:58\
and minds what we both knew\
already to be true.\
5:04\
The sealing ordinances found only\
in the house of the Lord\
5:09\
and administered by proper\
priesthood authority\
5:14\
had bound us together\
as husband and wife,\
5:18\
and our children had been sealed to us.\
5:23\
There truly, truly was\
no need to fear.\
5:28\
And we were grateful later to learn\
that our boys were safe.\
5:35\
Perhaps this statement from President\
Thomas S. Monson best illustrates what\
5:41\
Kathy and I felt on that unforgettable\
night. Quote. “As we attend the temple\
5:51\
there can come to us a dimension of\
spirituality, a feeling of peace. ...\
5:59\
We will grasp the true meaning of the\
words of the Savior when He said:\
6:07\
’Peace I leave with you; my\
peace I give unto you. ...\
6:12\
Let not your heart be troubled, neither\
let it be afraid.’” End quote.\
6:20\
I have been blessed to feel that peace\
every time I enter the sacred temple.\
6:28\
I recall the first day\
I walked into the Salt Lake Temple.\
6:34\
I was a young man. I looked up at\
a high white ceiling that made\
6:41\
the room so light it seemed almost\
as if it were open to the sky.\
6:49\
And in that moment, the thought came\
into my mind in clear words,\
6:56\
“I have been in this lighted\
place before.”\
7:01\
But then immediately came into my mind,\
not in my own voice,\
7:08\
these words. “No, you have\
never been here before.\
7:14\
You are remembering a moment\
before you were born.\
7:18\
You were in a sacred place like this\
where the Lord could come.”\
7:26\
Brothers and sisters, I humbly testify\
that as we attend the temple,\
7:32\
we can be reminded of the eternal\
nature of our spirits,\
7:37\
our relationship with the Father\
and His Divine Son,\
7:42\
and our ultimate desire to return\
to our heavenly home.\
7:50\
In recent conference addresses President\
Russell M. Nelson taught,\
7:58\
“The safest place to be spiritually\
is living inside your temple\
8:03\
covenants. ... Everything we believe\
8:06\
and every promise God has made to His\
covenant people come together in\
8:12\
the temple.” “Each person who makes\
covenants ... in temples—and keeps them—\
8:18\
has increased access to the power\
of Jesus Christ.” Close quote.\
8:26\
He also taught that “once we\
make a covenant with God,\
8:31\
we leave neutral ground forever.\
8:35\
God will not abandon His relationship\
with those who have forged such\
8:42\
a bond with Him. In fact, all those\
who have made a covenant with God\
8:48\
have access to a special\
kind of love and mercy.”\
8:56\
Under President Nelson's\
inspired leadership,\
8:59\
the Lord has accelerated and\
will continue to accelerate\
9:04\
the building of temples\
across the world.\
9:08\
This will allow all of God's children\
the opportunity to receive\
9:14\
the ordinances of salvation\
and exaltation,\
9:19\
and to make and keep sacred covenants.\
9:23\
Qualifying to make sacred covenants\
is not a one time effort,\
9:30\
but a lifetime pattern. The Lord has\
said it will take our full heart, might,\
9:37\
mind, and strength. Frequent\
participation in the ordinances of\
9:45\
the temple can create a pattern\
of devotion to the Lord.\
9:52\
When you keep your temple covenants,\
you remember them.\
9:57\
You invite the companionship of the\
Holy Ghost to both strengthen\
10:02\
and purify you.\
10:06\
You may then experience a feeling\
of light and hope,\
10:13\
testifying that the promises are true.\
10:17\
You will come to know that every\
covenant with God is\
10:22\
an opportunity to draw closer to Him,\
10:26\
which will then create a desire in your\
heart to keep temple covenants.\
10:33\
We have been promised, “Because\
of our covenant with God,\
10:39\
He will never tire in His\
efforts to help us,\
10:44\
and we will never exhaust His\
merciful patience with us.”\
10:51\
It is through the sealing covenants\
in the temple that we can receive\
10:56\
the assurance of loving family\
connections that will continue after\
11:02\
death and last for eternity.\
11:06\
Honoring marriage and family covenants\
made in temples of God will provide\
11:13\
protection from the evil of\
selfishness and pride.\
11:20\
Consistent care of brothers and sisters\
11:23\
for each other will come only with\
persistent efforts to lead your family\
11:30\
in the Lord's way. Give children\
opportunities to pray for each other.\
11:37\
Discern quickly the beginnings\
of discord\
11:41\
and positively recognize acts\
of unselfish service,\
11:47\
especially to one another.\
11:49\
When siblings pray for each other\
and serve each other,\
11:55\
hearts will be softened and turned to\
each other and to their parents.\
12:02\
In part, that is what is described\
by Malachi as he foretold of\
12:08\
the coming of the prophet Elijah. Quote.\
12:14\
“He shall plant in the hearts\
of the children\
12:17\
the promises made to the fathers,\
and the hearts of\
12:22\
the children will turn to their fathers.\
If it were not so\
12:27\
the whole earth would be utterly\
wasted at his coming.”\
12:34\
Trials, challenges, and heartaches\
will surely come to all of us.\
12:39\
None of us are immune from\
“the thorns of the flesh.”\
12:45\
Yet as we attend the temple and\
remember our covenants,\
12:51\
we can prepare to receive personal\
direction from the Lord.\
12:58\
When Kathy and I were married and\
sealed in the Logan Utah Temple,\
13:05\
then Elder Spencer W. Kimball performed\
our sealing. In the few words he spoke,\
13:14\
he gave this counsel: “Hal and Kathy,\
13:19\
live so that when the call comes,\
you can walk away easily.”\
13:29\
Initially we did not understand what\
that counsel meant for us.\
13:35\
But we did our best to live\
our lives in such\
13:38\
a way that we would be\
prepared to leave,\
13:43\
to serve the Lord when the call came.\
13:48\
After we had been married\
nearly 10 years,\
13:51\
an unanticipated call did come from the\
Commissioner of Church Education,\
13:58\
Neil A. Maxwell. The loving counsel\
given by President Kimball in\
14:06\
the temple to be able to walk\
away easily became a reality.\
14:14\
Kathy and I received a call\
to leave what seemed\
14:19\
an idyllic family situation\
in California\
14:23\
to serve in an assignment and in a\
place that I knew nothing about.\
14:31\
However, our family was ready to leave\
because a prophet in a holy temple,\
14:39\
a place of revelation, saw a future\
event for which we were then prepared.\
14:49\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
14:51\
I bear witness that there is nothing\
more important than honoring\
14:56\
the covenants you make or\
may make in the temple.\
15:02\
No matter where you are\
on the covenant path,\
15:06\
I urge you to qualify and become\
eligible to attend the temple.\
15:13\
Visit as frequently as circumstances\
will allow.\
15:18\
Make and keep sacred covenants with God.\
15:23\
I can assure you of the same truth I\
shared with Kathy in the middle of\
15:29\
the night nearly five decades ago\
in an Idaho Falls motel room.\
15:38\
No matter the outcome, all will be well\
because of the temple covenants.\
15:47\
I give you my sure witness\
that Jesus is the Christ.\
15:51\
He lives and leads His Church. Temples\
are houses of the Lord.\
15:59\
President Russell M. Nelson\
16:03\
is God’s living prophet\
on the earth. I love him.\
16:11\
And I love each of you. In the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
