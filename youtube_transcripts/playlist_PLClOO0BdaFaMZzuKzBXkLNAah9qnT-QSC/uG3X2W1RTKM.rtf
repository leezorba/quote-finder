My message is for those who worry\
about their testimony\
0:05\
because they haven't had overwhelming\
spiritual experiences.\
0:08\
I pray that I can provide some\
peace and assurance.\
0:12\
The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ began with an explosion of light\
0:17\
and truth. A teenage boy\
in upstate New York,\
0:20\
with the very ordinary name of Joseph\
Smith, enters a grove of trees to pray.\
0:27\
He's worried about his soul and\
his standing before God.\
0:31\
He seeks forgiveness for his sins,\
0:33\
and he’s confused about which church to\
join. He needs clarity and peace—\
0:38\
he needs light and knowledge.\
0:41\
As Joseph kneels to pray and “offer up\
the desires of [his] heart to God,”\
0:45\
a thick darkness envelops him.\
0:47\
Something evil, oppressive, and\
very real tries to stop him—\
0:52\
to bind his tongue so he cannot speak.\
0:56\
The forces of darkness get so intense\
that Joseph thinks he's going to die,\
1:01\
but he “exert[s] all [his] powers\
to call upon God to\
1:05\
deliver [him] out of the power of this\
enemy which [has] seized upon [him].”\
1:10\
And then, “at the very moment when\
[he’s] ready to sink into despair\
1:14\
and abandon [himself to destruction],”\
1:16\
when he doesn't know if he\
can hang on any longer,\
1:21\
a glorious brilliance fills the grove,\
1:23\
scattering the darkness and the enemy\
of his soul. A “pillar of light”\
1:30\
brighter than the sun\
gradually descends upon him.\
1:34\
One personage appears, and then another.\
1:37\
Their “brightness and glory\
defy all description.” The\
1:41\
first, our Heavenly Father, speaks his\
name, pointing to the other, “[Joseph!],\
1:48\
This is My Beloved Son. Hear him!”\
1:52\
And with that overwhelming\
burst of light and truth,\
1:55\
the Restoration has begun.\
1:57\
A veritable flood of divine revelation\
and blessings will follow.\
2:01\
New scripture, restored priesthood keys,\
apostles and prophets,\
2:05\
ordinances and covenants,\
2:07\
and the reestablishment of the Lord’s\
true and living Church,\
2:10\
which will someday fill the\
earth with the light\
2:14\
and witness of Jesus Christ and\
His restored gospel. All that,\
2:19\
and much more, began with a boy’s\
desperate prayer and a pillar of light.\
2:27\
We too have our own desperate needs.\
2:30\
We too need freedom from spiritual\
confusion and worldly darkness.\
2:35\
We too need to know for ourselves.\
2:38\
That is one reason President Russell\
M. Nelson has invited us to “immerse\
2:42\
[ourselves] in the glorious light\
of the Restoration.”\
2:46\
One of the great truths of\
the Restoration is that\
2:49\
the heavens are open, that we too can\
receive light and knowledge from\
2:54\
on high. I testify that is true. But we\
must be wary of a spiritual trap.\
3:02\
Sometimes faithful Church members become\
discouraged and even drift away\
3:06\
because they haven’t had overwhelming\
spiritual experiences—\
3:10\
because they haven't experienced, as\
it were, their own pillar of light.\
3:15\
President Spencer W. Kimball warned that\
“Always expecting the spectacular,\
3:21\
many will miss entirely the constant\
flow of revealed communication.”\
3:26\
President Joseph F. Smith recalled “the\
Lord withheld marvels from me [when\
3:31\
I was young], and showed me the truth,\
line upon line, precept upon precept,\
3:37\
here a little and there a little.”\
3:40\
That is the Lord's typical pattern,\
brothers and sisters.\
3:44\
Rather than sending us a pillar of\
light, the Lord sends us a ray of light,\
3:52\
and then another, and another.\
3:55\
Those rays of light are continuously\
being poured down upon us.\
3:58\
The scriptures teach that Jesus Christ\
is the “light and life of the world,”\
4:03\
that His “Spirit giveth light to every\
man [and woman] that cometh into\
4:06\
the world,” and that His light “fill[s]\
the immensity of space,”\
4:10\
giving “life to all things.” The light\
of Christ is literally all around us.\
4:17\
If we have received the gift of\
4:19\
the Holy Ghost and are striving\
to exercise faith, repent,\
4:23\
and honor our covenants, then we are\
worthy to receive these divine rays\
4:29\
constantly. In Elder David A. Bednar’s\
memorable phrase, “We are living in\
4:35\
revelation.” And yet, every\
one of us is different.\
4:41\
No two people experience God's light\
and truth in exactly the same way.\
4:47\
Take some time to think about how you\
experience the light and Spirit of\
4:51\
the Lord. You may have experienced these\
bursts of light and testimony as\
4:56\
“peace [spoken] to your mind concerning\
[a] matter” that has worried you.\
5:01\
Or as an impression—a still small\
voice—that settled “in your mind\
5:06\
and in your heart,” and urged you to do\
something good, such as help someone.\
5:11\
Perhaps you’ve been in a class\
at Church—or at a youth camp—\
5:15\
and felt a strong desire to follow\
Jesus Christ and stay faithful.\
5:20\
Maybe you even stood and shared a\
testimony that you hoped was true,\
5:26\
and then felt it was. Or maybe\
you've been praying and felt\
5:31\
a joyful assurance that God loves you.\
5:34\
You may have heard someone bear\
testimony of Jesus Christ,\
5:37\
and it touched your heart and\
filled you with hope.\
5:41\
Perhaps you were reading in the Book of\
Mormon and a verse spoke to your soul\
5:45\
as if God had put it there just for you,\
5:48\
and then you realized that He had.\
5:51\
You may have felt the love of God\
for others as you serve them.\
5:55\
Or maybe you struggle to feel\
the Spirit in the moment\
5:59\
because of depression or anxiety,\
6:02\
but have the precious gift and\
the faith to look back\
6:05\
and recognize past “tender\
mercies of the Lord.”\
6:09\
My point is that there are many ways to\
receive heavenly rays of testimony.\
6:15\
These are just a few, of course.\
6:17\
They may not be dramatic, but all of\
them form part of our testimonies.\
6:24\
Brothers and sisters, I have\
not seen a pillar of light,\
6:29\
but like you, I have experienced many\
divine rays. Over the years\
6:34\
I've tried to treasure such experiences.\
6:36\
I find that as I do, I recognize\
and remember even more of them.\
6:41\
Here are some examples from my own life.\
6:44\
They may not be very impressive to some,\
but they are precious to me.\
6:50\
I remember being a rowdy\
teenager at a baptism.\
6:53\
As the meeting was about to begin,\
6:55\
I felt the Spirit urge me to\
sit down and be reverent.\
6:59\
I sat down and stayed quiet\
the rest of the meeting.\
7:03\
Before my mission, I was afraid my\
testimony wasn't strong enough.\
7:07\
No one in my family had\
ever served a mission,\
7:10\
and I didn't know if I could do it.\
7:13\
I remember studying and praying\
desperately to receive\
7:15\
a more certain witness of Jesus Christ.\
7:18\
And then one day, as I pled\
with Heavenly Father,\
7:22\
I felt a powerful sense of light and\
warmth. And I knew, I just knew.\
7:29\
I remember being awakened\
one night years later\
7:32\
by a feeling of pure intelligence\
telling me\
7:34\
I would be called to serve\
in the elders quorum.\
7:37\
Two weeks later, I was called.\
7:40\
I remember a general conference where\
a beloved member of the Quorum of\
7:44\
the Twelve Apostles spoke the exact\
words of testimony I had told a friend\
7:49\
I hoped to hear. I remember kneeling\
with hundreds of brethren to pray\
7:55\
for a dear friend who lay unconscious\
on a ventilator in a small,\
8:00\
faraway hospital after his\
heart had stopped.\
8:04\
As we united our own hearts\
to plead for his life,\
8:07\
he woke up and pulled the ventilator\
out of his own throat.\
8:12\
He serves today as a magnificent\
stake president.\
8:17\
And I remember waking up with strong\
spiritual feelings after\
8:21\
a vivid dream of a dear friend\
8:23\
and mentor who passed\
away far too early,\
8:26\
leaving an enormous hole in my life.\
He was smiling and joyful.\
8:32\
I knew he was okay. These\
are some of my rays.\
8:38\
You’ve had your own experiences, your\
own light-filled bursts of testimony.\
8:44\
As we recognize, remember, and gather\
these rays together in one,\
8:48\
something wonderful and powerful begins\
to happen. “Light cleaveth unto light”—\
8:54\
“truth embraceth truth.”\
8:57\
The reality and power of one\
ray of testimony reinforces\
9:01\
and combines with another, and\
then another and another.\
9:05\
Line upon line, precept upon precept,\
here a ray and there a ray—\
9:12\
one small, treasured spiritual\
moment at a time—\
9:16\
there grows up within us a core of\
light-filled spiritual experiences.\
9:22\
Perhaps no one ray is strong enough\
or bright enough to constitute\
9:28\
a full testimony, but together\
they can become a light that\
9:34\
the darkness of doubt cannot overcome.\
“Oh, then is not this real?” Alma asks.\
9:43\
“I say unto you, yea, because it is\
light.” “That which is of God is light,”\
9:52\
the Lord teaches us, “and\
he that receiveth light\
9:55\
and continueth in God receiveth\
more light,\
9:58\
and that light groweth brighter and\
brighter until the perfect day.”\
10:03\
Brothers and sisters, that means that\
in time and through great diligence,\
10:09\
we too can have our own pillar\
of light—one ray at a time.\
10:18\
And in the midst of that pillar, we too\
will find a loving Heavenly Father\
10:24\
calling us by name, pointing us to our\
Savior, Jesus Christ, and inviting us\
10:28\
to “Hear Him!” I bear witness of Jesus\
Christ, that He is the light\
10:34\
and life of the whole world—and of\
your personal world and mine.\
10:40\
I testify that He is the true\
and living Son of the true\
10:43\
and living God, and that He stands at\
the head of His true and living Church,\
10:47\
guided and directed by His true and\
living prophets and apostles.\
10:51\
May we recognize and receive\
His glorious light,\
10:55\
and then choose Him over the darkness\
of the world, always and forever.\
11:00\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
