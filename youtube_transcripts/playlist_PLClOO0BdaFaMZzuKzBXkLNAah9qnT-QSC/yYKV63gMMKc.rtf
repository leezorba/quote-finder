My dear brothers and sisters.\
0:03\
Today is an historic day for President\
Dallin H. Oaks and me.\
0:09\
It was 40 years ago, on April 7, 1984,\
0:15\
when we were called to the\
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\
0:19\
We have rejoiced in each and every\
general conference since then,\
0:25\
including this one. We have once\
again been blessed with\
0:31\
a sacred outpouring of the Spirit.\
0:35\
I hope you will repeatedly study\
0:38\
the messages of this conference\
throughout the coming months.\
0:44\
When I was born, there were six\
functioning temples in the Church,\
0:51\
one each in Saint George, Logan, Manti,\
and Salt Lake City, Utah,\
0:57\
as well as in Cardston, Alberta, Canada,\
and Laie, Hawaii.\
1:05\
Two earlier temples had functioned\
briefly in Kirtland, Ohio, and Nauvoo,\
1:13\
Illinois. As the body of\
the Church moved west\
1:18\
the Saints were forced to leave\
those two temples behind.\
1:25\
The Nauvoo Temple was destroyed\
by an arsonist's fire.\
1:32\
It was rebuilt and then dedicated\
by President Gordon B. Hinckley.\
1:39\
The Kirtland Temple was desecrated\
by enemies of the Church.\
1:46\
Later, the Kirtland Temple was acquired\
by Community of Christ,\
1:51\
which has owned it for many years.\
1:55\
Last month, we announced that The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\
2:00\
has purchased the Kirtland Temple,\
2:05\
along with several significant\
historical sites in Nauvoo.\
2:11\
We greatly appreciate the cordial\
2:13\
and mutually beneficial discussions we\
had with leaders from Community of\
2:19\
Christ that led to this agreement.\
2:23\
The Kirtland Temple has unusual\
significance in the Restoration of\
2:28\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
2:31\
Several events that took place there\
had been prophesied for millennia,\
2:39\
and were essential for the Lord’s\
restored Church to fulfill its latter\
2:45\
day mission. The most important of these\
events occurred on Easter Sunday,\
2:53\
April 3, 1836.\
2:56\
On that day, Joseph Smith and\
Oliver Cowdery experienced\
3:01\
a series of remarkable visitations.\
3:07\
First,\
3:08\
the Lord Jesus Christ appeared.\
3:14\
The Prophet recorded that the Savior’s\
“eyes were as the flame of fire;\
3:21\
the hair of his head was\
white like pure snow;\
3:26\
his countenance shown above\
the brightness of the sun;\
3:31\
and his voice was as the sound of\
the rushing of great waters.”\
3:41\
During this visitation, the Lord\
affirmed His identity. He said, quote,\
3:51\
“I am the first and the last;\
3:57\
I am he who liveth,\
I am he who was slain;\
4:07\
I am your advocate with the Father.”\
4:11\
Close quote.\
4:14\
Jesus Christ then declared that He had\
accepted the temple as His house\
4:21\
and made this stunning promise:\
4:25\
“I will manifest myself\
to my people in mercy\
4:33\
in this house.”\
4:37\
This significant promise applies to\
every dedicated temple today.\
4:45\
I invite you to ponder what the Lord's\
promise means for you personally.\
4:54\
Following the Savior's visitation,\
Moses appeared.\
4:59\
Moses conferred upon Joseph Smith the\
keys for the gathering of Israel\
5:07\
and the return of the ten tribes.\
5:13\
When this vision closed, Elias appeared\
and committed the dispensation of\
5:20\
the gospel of Abraham to Joseph. Then\
Elijah the Prophet appeared.\
5:30\
His appearance fulfilled Malachi's\
promise that before the Second Coming,\
5:37\
the Lord would send Elijah to “turn\
the heart of the fathers to\
5:43\
the children, and the heart of the\
children to their fathers.”\
5:51\
Elijah conferred the keys of the sealing\
power upon Joseph Smith.\
6:00\
The significance of these\
keys being returned to\
6:03\
the earth by three heavenly messengers\
under the direction of\
6:08\
the Lord cannot be overstated.\
6:14\
Priesthood keys constitute the authority\
and power of presidency.\
6:20\
Priesthood keys govern how\
6:24\
the priesthood of God may be used to\
bring about the Lord's purposes,\
6:30\
and bless all who accept the restored\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
6:40\
It is important to note that prior to\
the organization of the Church,\
6:45\
heavenly messengers had conferred the\
Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods\
6:53\
upon the Prophet Joseph, and had given\
him keys of both priesthoods.\
7:01\
The keys gave Joseph Smith authority\
to organize the Church in 1830.\
7:10\
Then in the Kirtland Temple in 1836,\
7:15\
the conferral of these three additional\
priesthood keys, namely\
7:22\
keys of the gathering of Israel,\
7:26\
keys of the gospel of Abraham,\
and the keys of\
7:30\
the sealing power, was essential.\
7:35\
These keys authorized Joseph Smith\
and all succeeding Presidents of\
7:39\
the Lord's Church to gather Israel\
on both sides of the veil,\
7:46\
to bless all covenant children with\
the blessings of Abraham,\
7:53\
to place a ratifying seal on priesthood\
ordinances and covenants,\
7:59\
and seal families eternally.\
8:05\
The power of these priesthood keys\
is infinite and breathtaking.\
8:14\
Consider how your life would be\
different if priesthood keys had not\
8:19\
been restored to the Earth.\
Without priesthood keys,\
8:25\
you could not be endowed\
with the power of God.\
8:31\
Without priesthood\
keys, the Church could\
8:35\
serve only as a significant teaching\
and humanitarian organization,\
8:41\
but not much more. Without\
priesthood keys,\
8:47\
none of us would have access\
to essential ordinances\
8:50\
and covenants that bind us to our loved\
ones eternally, and allow us eventually\
9:00\
to live with God. Priesthood keys\
distinguish The Church of Jesus Christ\
9:08\
of Latter-day Saints from any\
other organization on earth.\
9:14\
Many other organizations can and do make\
your life better here in mortality.\
9:23\
But no other organization can and will\
influence your life after death.\
9:34\
Priesthood keys give us the\
authority to extend all of\
9:39\
the blessings promised to Abraham, to\
every covenant-keeping man and woman.\
9:50\
Temple work makes these exquisite\
blessings available to all of God's\
9:57\
children, regardless of where or\
when they lived or now live.\
10:06\
Let us rejoice that priesthood keys\
are once again on the earth.\
10:15\
I invite you to consider carefully\
the following three statements.\
10:22\
One.\
10:24\
The gathering of Israel is evidence\
that God loves all\
10:30\
of His children everywhere.\
10:33\
Two.\
10:35\
The Gospel of Abraham is further\
evidence that God loves all of His\
10:41\
children everywhere. He invites\
“all to come unto Him ...\
10:48\
black and white, bond and free, male and\
female; ... all are alike unto God.”\
10:55\
And three. The sealing power is supernal\
evidence of how much God loves\
11:03\
all of His children everywhere\
11:07\
and wants each of them to choose\
to return to Him.\
11:14\
Priesthood keys restored through\
the Prophet Joseph Smith\
11:19\
make it possible for every\
covenant-keeping man\
11:23\
and woman to enjoy incredible personal\
spiritual privileges.\
11:35\
Here again, there’s much we can learn\
from this sacred history of\
11:40\
the Kirtland Temple. Joseph Smith’s\
dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland\
11:48\
Temple\
11:49\
is a tutorial about how the temple\
spiritually empowers you and me to meet\
11:57\
the challenges of life\
in these last days.\
12:02\
I encourage you to study that prayer\
recorded in Doctrine and Covenants\
12:07\
section 109. That dedicatory prayer,\
which was received by revelation,\
12:16\
teaches that the temple is “a house\
of prayer, a house of fasting,\
12:26\
a house of faith, a house of learning,\
a house of glory, a house of order,\
12:36\
a house of God.” This list of attributes\
is much more than a description of\
12:45\
a temple. It's a promise about what\
will happen to those who serve\
12:53\
and worship in the house of the Lord.\
12:58\
They can expect to receive answers\
to prayer, personal revelation, greater\
13:05\
faith, strength, comfort, increased\
knowledge, and increased power.\
13:16\
Time in the temple will help you\
to think celestial and to catch\
13:22\
a vision of who you really are,\
who you can become,\
13:31\
and the kind of life you\
can have forever.\
13:37\
Regular temple worship will enhance\
the way you see yourself\
13:42\
and how you fit into God’s\
magnificent plan. I promise you that.\
13:49\
We are also promised that in the temple\
we may receive a “fulness of\
13:54\
the Holy Ghost.” Imagine what that\
promise means in terms of having\
14:02\
the heavens open for each earnest\
seeker of eternal truth.\
14:09\
We are instructed that all who worship\
in the temple will have\
14:16\
the power of God, and with angels\
having “charge over them.”\
14:23\
How much does it increase\
your confidence to know\
14:27\
that\
14:28\
as an endowed woman or man, armed\
with the power of God,\
14:35\
you do not have to face life alone.\
14:41\
What courage does it give\
you to know that angels\
14:46\
really\
14:47\
will help you?\
14:51\
Finally, we are promised that no\
combination of wickedness will prevail\
14:58\
over those who worship in\
the house of the Lord.\
15:05\
Understanding the spiritual privileges\
made possible in\
15:09\
the temple is vital to each of us today.\
My dear brothers and sisters.\
15:20\
Here is my promise.\
15:23\
Nothing will help you more to hold fast\
to the iron rod than worshiping in\
15:30\
the temple as regularly as your\
circumstances permit.\
15:37\
Nothing will protect you more as you\
encounter the world’s mists of darkness.\
15:45\
Nothing will bolster your testimony of\
the Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement,\
15:52\
or help you understand God's\
magnificent plan more.\
15:59\
Nothing will soothe your spirit\
more during times of pain.\
16:05\
Nothing will open the heavens more.\
16:10\
Nothing.\
16:13\
The temple is the gateway to the\
greatest blessings God has in store\
16:19\
for each of us, for the temple\
is the only place on\
16:26\
Earth\
16:27\
where we may receive all of the\
blessings promised to Abraham.\
16:37\
That is why we are doing\
all within our power,\
16:42\
under the direction of the Lord,\
16:45\
to make the temple blessings more\
accessible to members of the Church.\
16:53\
Thus, we are pleased to announce\
that we plan to build\
16:58\
a new temple in each of the\
following 15 locations.\
17:06\
Uturoa, French Polynesia.\
17:11\
Chihuahua, Mexico.\
17:15\
Florianópolis, Brazil.\
17:18\
Rosario, Argentina.\
17:21\
Edinburgh, Scotland.\
17:25\
Brisbane Australia\
South Area.\
17:30\
Victoria, British Columbia.\
17:33\
Yuma, Arizona.\
17:37\
Houston Texas South Area.\
17:42\
Des Moines, Iowa.\
17:44\
Cincinnati, Ohio.\
17:47\
Honolulu, Hawaii.\
17:50\
West Jordan, Utah.\
17:54\
Lehi, Utah.\
17:58\
And Maracaibo, Venezuela.\
18:02\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
18:06\
I testify that this is The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
18:13\
He stands at its head.\
18:16\
We are His\
disciples. Let us rejoice\
18:23\
in the restoration of priesthood keys,\
18:27\
which make it possible for you\
18:29\
and me to enjoy every spiritual\
blessing we are willing\
18:37\
and worthy to receive. I so testify\
18:43\
in the sacred name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
