During a recent open house and media\
day for a new house of the Lord,\
0:05\
I led a group of journalists on a tour\
through the sacred structure.\
0:10\
I described the purposes of temples in\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
0:15\
Saints and responded to their\
many excellent questions.\
0:20\
Before entering the celestial room,\
0:22\
I explained that this particular\
room in the house of\
0:27\
the Lord symbolically represents\
the peace and beauty of\
0:32\
the heavenly home to which we\
can return after this life.\
0:36\
I indicated to our guests that we would\
not speak while in the celestial room,\
0:42\
but I would be happy to answer any\
questions after we move to\
0:46\
the next stop on the tour.\
0:49\
After exiting the celestial room, and\
as we gathered at the next location,\
0:55\
I asked our guests if they had any\
observations they wanted to share.\
1:00\
One of the journalists said\
with great emotion,\
1:05\
I have never experienced anything\
like that in my life.\
1:11\
I did not know quiet like that\
existed in the world.\
1:15\
I simply did not believe such\
stillness was possible.\
1:22\
I was struck by both the sincerity and\
1:25\
the starkness of this\
person's statement,\
1:30\
and the journalist’s reaction highlighted\
one important aspect of\
1:34\
stillness—overcoming and tuning out\
1:38\
the commotion of our external\
environment.\
1:41\
As I later pondered the journalist's\
comment and reflected on\
1:46\
the often hectic pace of our modern\
lives—the busyness, noise, diversions,\
1:53\
distractions, and detours that so often\
seem to demand our attention—\
1:59\
a scripture came to my mind: “Be\
still and know that I am God.”\
2:05\
I pray the Holy Ghost will\
enlighten each of us\
2:09\
as we consider a higher and holier\
dimension of stillness in our lives,\
2:14\
an inner spiritual stillness of the\
soul that enables us to know\
2:21\
and remember that God is\
our Heavenly Father.\
2:23\
We are His children, and Jesus\
Christ is our Savior.\
2:29\
This remarkable blessing is available to\
all Church members who are striving\
2:34\
faithfully to become covenant\
people of the Lord. In 1833,\
2:41\
the Saints in Missouri were the targets\
of intense persecution.\
2:46\
Mobs had driven them from their\
homes in Jackson County,\
2:49\
and some Church members had tried to\
establish themselves in other nearby\
2:54\
counties. But the persecution continued\
and the threats of death were many.\
3:01\
In these challenging circumstances,\
3:03\
the Lord revealed the following\
instruction to\
3:06\
the Prophet Joseph Smith\
in Kirtland, Ohio.\
3:10\
Therefore, let your hearts be\
comforted concerning Zion,\
3:16\
for all flesh is in mine hands. Be\
still and know that I am God.\
3:25\
I believe the Lord's admonition\
to be still entails much,\
3:29\
much more than simply not\
talking or not moving.\
3:34\
Perhaps His intent is for us to\
remember and rely upon Him\
3:38\
and His power at all times,\
and in all things,\
3:42\
and in all places that we may be in.\
3:46\
Thus, “be still” may be a way of\
reminding us to focus upon\
3:51\
the Savior unfailingly, as\
the ultimate source of\
3:55\
the spiritual stillness of the soul\
that strengthens us to do\
4:00\
and overcome hard things.\
4:04\
True faith is always focused in\
and on the Lord Jesus Christ,\
4:10\
in Him as the divine and Only Begotten\
Son of the Eternal Father,\
4:16\
and on Him and the redemptive\
mission He fulfilled.\
4:21\
For He hath answered the\
ends of the law.\
4:24\
And He claimeth all those\
who have faith in Him,\
4:28\
and they who have faith in Him will\
cleave unto every good thing.\
4:32\
Wherefore He advocated the cause\
of the children of men.\
4:38\
Jesus Christ is our Redeemer,\
our Mediator,\
4:42\
and our Advocate with the\
Eternal Father and\
4:46\
the Rock upon which we should build the\
spiritual foundation of our lives.\
4:52\
Helaman explained, Remember,\
4:55\
remember, that it is upon the rock\
of our Redeemer, who is Christ,\
5:00\
the Son of God, that ye must build your—\
that ye must build your foundation,\
5:09\
that when the devil shall send\
forth his mighty winds, yea,\
5:13\
his shafts in the whirlwind,\
5:14\
yea, when all his hail and his mighty\
storm shall beat upon you,\
5:19\
it shall have no power over you\
5:22\
to drag you down to the gulf\
of misery and endless woe\
5:25\
because of the rock upon which ye are\
built, which is a sure foundation,\
5:32\
a foundation whereon if men build,\
they cannot fall.\
5:37\
The symbolism of Christ as the Rock\
upon whom we should build\
5:42\
the foundation of our lives\
is most instructive.\
5:47\
Please note in this verse that the\
Savior is not the foundation.\
5:53\
Rather, we are admonished to build\
our personal foundation upon Him.\
6:01\
The foundation is the part of a\
building that connects it to\
6:04\
the ground. A strong foundation provides\
protection from natural\
6:09\
disasters and many other\
destructive forces.\
6:13\
A proper foundation also distributes\
the weight of a structure over\
6:18\
a large area to avoid overloading\
the underlying soil\
6:23\
and provide a level surface\
for construction.\
6:27\
A strong and reliable connection\
between the ground and\
6:31\
a foundation is essential. If a\
structure is to remain sturdy\
6:36\
and stable over time, and for particular\
types of construction,\
6:42\
anchor pins and steel rods can be\
used to attach the foundation of\
6:48\
a building to bedrock, the hard, solid\
rock beneath surface material\
6:55\
such as soil and gravel.\
In a similar way,\
7:00\
the foundation of our lives\
must be connected to\
7:04\
the Rock of Christ if we are to\
remain firm and steadfast.\
7:09\
The sacred covenants and ordinances of\
7:12\
the Savior's restored gospel can\
be compared to the anchor pins\
7:17\
and steel rods used to connect\
a building to bedrock.\
7:23\
Every time we faithfully receive,\
review, remember,\
7:27\
and renew sacred covenants,\
7:29\
our spiritual anchors are secured ever\
more firmly and steadfastly to\
7:35\
the Rock of Jesus Christ.\
7:39\
Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might\
with surety hope for a better world,\
7:44\
yea, even a place at the right hand of\
God, which hope cometh of faith,\
7:50\
maketh an anchor to the souls of men,\
7:54\
which would make them\
sure and steadfast,\
7:57\
always abounding in good works,\
being led to glorify God\
8:03\
Incrementally and increasingly\
in process of time,\
8:08\
virtue garnishes our thoughts\
unceasingly.\
8:12\
Our confidence waxes stronger and\
stronger in the presence of God,\
8:17\
and the Holy Ghost is our\
constant companion.\
8:20\
We become more grounded, rooted,\
established,\
8:25\
and settled. As the foundation of our\
lives is built upon the Savior,\
8:31\
we are blessed to be still,\
8:35\
to have a spiritual assurance that\
God is our Heavenly Father,\
8:39\
we are His children, and Jesus\
Christ is our Savior.\
8:46\
The Lord provides both sacred times and\
holy places to help us experience\
8:54\
and learn about this inner\
stillness of our souls.\
8:58\
For example, the Sabbath is God's day,\
9:01\
a sacred time set apart to remember\
and worship the Father in\
9:06\
the name of His Son, to participate in\
priesthood ordinances, and to receive\
9:13\
and renew sacred covenants.\
9:16\
Each week we worship the Lord during\
our home study and also\
9:21\
as fellow citizens with the saints\
during sacrament and other meetings.\
9:26\
On His holy day, our thoughts, actions,\
9:29\
and demeanor are signs we give to God\
and an indicator of our love for Him.\
9:36\
Every Sunday, if we will,\
9:40\
we can be still and know that\
God is our Heavenly Father,\
9:44\
we are His children, and Jesus\
Christ is our Savior.\
9:51\
A central feature of our Sabbath worship\
is to go to the house of prayer\
9:55\
and offer up our sacraments\
upon the Lord's holy day.\
10:00\
The houses of prayer in which we gather\
on the Sabbath are meetinghouses\
10:05\
and other approved facilities—holy\
places of reverence, worship,\
10:12\
and learning. Each meetinghouse\
10:16\
and facility is dedicated by priesthood\
authority as a place where\
10:20\
the Spirit of the Lord may dwell,\
10:22\
and where God's children may come to\
the knowledge of their Redeemer.\
10:27\
If we will, we can be still in\
our holy places of worship,\
10:34\
and know ever more surely that\
God is our Heavenly Father,\
10:38\
we are His children, and Jesus\
Christ is our Savior.\
10:44\
The temple is another holy place\
specifically set apart for worshipping\
10:49\
and serving God and learning\
eternal truths.\
10:53\
We think, act, and dress differently\
in the house of\
10:57\
the Lord from any other places that\
we may frequent. In His holy house,\
11:04\
if we will, we can be still and know\
that God is our Heavenly Father,\
11:11\
we are His children, and Jesus\
Christ is our Savior.\
11:17\
The principal purposes of sacred time\
and holy places are exactly the same.\
11:24\
To repeatedly focus our attention upon\
Heavenly Father and His plan,\
11:30\
the Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement,\
the edifying power of the Holy Ghost,\
11:36\
and the promises associated with the\
sacred ordinances and covenants of\
11:41\
the Savior’s restored gospel. Today,\
11:46\
I repeat a principle I previously have\
emphasized. Our homes should be\
11:53\
the ultimate combination of both\
sacred time and holy place,\
12:00\
wherein individuals and\
families can be still\
12:05\
and know that God is our\
Heavenly Father,\
12:08\
we are His children, and Jesus\
Christ is our Savior.\
12:14\
Leaving our homes to worship on the\
Sabbath and in the house of\
12:18\
the Lord certainly is essential,\
12:20\
but only as we return to our homes\
with the spiritual perspective\
12:26\
and strength obtained in those\
holy places and activities\
12:31\
can we then sustain our focus upon the\
primary purposes of mortal life\
12:37\
and overcome the temptations so\
prevalent in our fallen world.\
12:42\
Our ongoing Sabbath, temple, and home\
experiences should fortify us with\
12:50\
the power of the Holy Ghost,\
12:52\
with an ongoing and stronger covenant\
connection to the Father and the Son,\
12:58\
and with a perfect brightness of\
hope in God's eternal promises.\
13:04\
As home and Church are gathered\
together in one in Christ,\
13:09\
we may be troubled on every side,\
13:12\
but we will not be distressed\
in our minds and hearts.\
13:16\
We may be perplexed by our circumstances\
and challenges,\
13:20\
but we will not be in despair.\
13:24\
We may be persecuted, but we will also\
recognize that we are never alone.\
13:29\
We can receive spiritual strength to\
become and remain firm, steadfast,\
13:36\
and true.\
13:39\
I promise that as we build the\
foundation of our lives on\
13:44\
the Rock of Jesus Christ,\
13:47\
we can be blessed by the Holy Ghost\
to receive an individual\
13:51\
and spiritual stillness of the\
soul that enables us to know\
13:57\
and remember that God is our Heavenly\
Father, we are His children,\
14:02\
Jesus Christ is our Savior,\
14:05\
and we can be blessed to do\
and overcome hard things.\
14:10\
I joyfully witness that God\
is our Heavenly Father,\
14:15\
we are His children, and Jesus\
Christ is our Redeemer and\
14:21\
the Rock of our salvation.\
14:24\
I so testify in the sacred name of the\
Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
