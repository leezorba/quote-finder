Years ago, my wife Ruth,\
our daughter, Ashley,\
0:05\
and I joined other tourists\
on a kayaking excursion in\
0:09\
the state of Hawaii in\
the United States.\
0:12\
A kayak is a low-to-the-water,\
0:15\
canoe-like boat in which the rower\
sits facing forward and uses\
0:20\
a double-bladed paddle to pull front to\
back on one side and then on the other.\
0:26\
The plan was to row to two small\
islands off the coast of Oahu\
0:31\
and back again. I was confident\
because as a young man\
0:35\
I had paddled kayaks across\
mountain lakes.\
0:40\
Hubris never bodes well, does it?\
0:44\
Our guide gave us instructions\
and showed us\
0:47\
the ocean kayaks we would use.\
0:49\
They differed from the ones\
I had previously paddled.\
0:52\
I was supposed to sit on top of the\
kayak instead of down inside it.\
0:57\
When I got on to the kayak,\
0:59\
my center of gravity was higher\
than I was accustomed to and\
1:03\
I was less stable in the water.\
1:06\
As we started out, I rowed faster\
than Ruth and Ashley.\
1:11\
After a while, I was far ahead of them.\
1:16\
Though proud of my heroic pace,\
1:20\
I stopped paddling and waited for them\
to catch up. A large wave, this big,\
1:30\
about 13cm, hit the side of my kayak\
and flipped me over into the water.\
1:35\
By the time I turned the kayak upright\
and struggled to get back on top,\
1:40\
Ruth and Ashley had passed me by, but\
I was too winded to resume paddling.\
1:47\
Before I could catch my breath, another\
wave, this one truly enormous,\
1:53\
this big, at least 20cm, hit my kayak\
and flipped me over again.\
2:01\
By the time I managed\
to right the kayak,\
2:04\
I was so out of breath I feared I\
wouldn't be able to climb on top.\
2:10\
Upon seeing my situation, the guide\
rowed over, steadied my kayak,\
2:14\
making it easier for me to climb on top.\
2:18\
When he saw that I was still too\
breathless to row on my own,\
2:22\
he hitched a tow rope to my\
kayak and began paddling,\
2:27\
pulling me along with him.\
2:29\
Soon I caught my breath and began\
paddling adequately on my own.\
2:34\
He let go of the rope and I reached\
2:37\
the first island without\
further assistance.\
2:40\
Upon arrival, I flopped down\
on the sand, exhausted.\
2:46\
After the group had rested, the guide\
quietly said to me, “Mr. Renlund,\
2:53\
If you just keep paddling, maintaining\
your momentum,\
2:58\
I think you’re going to be fine.”\
3:00\
I followed his advice as we paddled\
to the second island\
3:04\
and then back to our starting point.\
3:06\
Twice the guide rode by and\
told me I was doing great.\
3:13\
Even larger waves hit my kayak from the\
side, but I wasn't flipped over.\
3:20\
By consistently paddling the kayak,\
3:23\
I maintained momentum and\
forward progress,\
3:27\
mitigating the effect of waves\
hitting me from the side.\
3:32\
The same principle applies\
in our spiritual lives.\
3:36\
We become vulnerable when we slow down,\
and especially when we stop.\
3:45\
If we maintain spiritual momentum by\
continually rowing toward the Savior,\
3:50\
we're safer and more secure because\
our eternal life depends\
3:56\
on our faith in Him. Spiritual momentum\
is created “over a lifetime\
4:02\
as we repeatedly embrace the doctrine\
of Christ.” Doing so,\
4:08\
President Russell M. Nelson taught,\
produces a “powerful, virtuous cycle.”\
4:14\
Indeed the elements of the\
doctrine of Christ,\
4:17\
such as faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,\
repentance,\
4:22\
entering a covenant relationship\
with the Lord through baptism,\
4:26\
receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost,\
and enduring to the end,\
4:30\
are not intended to be experienced\
as one-time check-the-box\
4:34\
events. In particular,\
4:37\
enduring to the end is not\
really a separate step in\
4:42\
the doctrine of Christ, as though we\
complete the first four elements,\
4:47\
then hunker down, grit our teeth,\
and wait to die.\
4:51\
No, enduring to the end is repeatedly\
and iteratively applying\
4:58\
the other elements of the doctrine\
of Christ, creating the powerful,\
5:02\
virtuous cycle that President\
Nelson described.\
5:06\
“Repeatedly” means that we experience\
the elements of\
5:10\
the doctrine of Christ over and\
over throughout our lives.\
5:15\
“Iteratively” means that we build on\
and improve with each repetition.\
5:21\
Even though we repeat the elements,\
5:23\
we're not just spinning in circles\
without a forward trajectory.\
5:28\
Instead, we draw closer to Jesus Christ\
each time through the cycle.\
5:35\
Momentum involves both\
speed and direction.\
5:40\
If I'd paddled the kayak vigorously\
in the wrong direction,\
5:44\
I could have created significant\
momentum,\
5:47\
but I wouldn't have reached\
the intended destination.\
5:51\
Similarly, in life, we need to “row”\
toward the Savior to come unto Him.\
5:58\
Our faith in Jesus Christ needs\
to be nourished daily.\
6:02\
It’s nourished as we pray daily,\
study the scriptures daily,\
6:09\
reflect on the goodness of God daily,\
6:13\
repent daily, and follow the promptings\
of the Holy Ghost daily.\
6:21\
Just as it's not healthy to defer\
eating all our food until Sunday\
6:25\
and then binge our weekly\
allotment of nutrition,\
6:29\
it’s not spiritually healthy to restrict\
our testimony-nourishing\
6:34\
behavior to one day in the week.\
6:37\
When we assume responsibility\
for our own testimonies,\
6:41\
we gain spiritual momentum\
6:43\
and gradually develop bedrock\
faith in Jesus Christ.\
6:48\
And the doctrine of Christ becomes\
central to the purpose of life.\
6:53\
Momentum likewise builds as we strive\
to obey the laws of God and repent.\
6:58\
Repentance is joyful and allows\
us to learn from our mistakes,\
7:03\
which is how we progress eternally.\
7:07\
We will undoubtedly have times when\
we flip over in our kayaks\
7:12\
and find ourselves in deep water.\
7:15\
Through repentance, we can get\
back on top and continue,\
7:19\
no matter how many times\
we've fallen off.\
7:22\
The important part is that\
we do not give up.\
7:28\
The next element in the doctrine\
of Christ is baptism,\
7:32\
which includes the baptism of water\
and through confirmation,\
7:37\
the baptism of the Holy Ghost.\
7:40\
While baptism is a singular event,\
7:43\
we renew our baptismal covenant\
repeatedly when we partake of\
7:48\
the sacrament. The sacrament\
doesn't replace baptism,\
7:53\
but it links the initial elements\
in the doctrine of Christ—\
7:57\
faith and repentance—with reception\
of the Holy Ghost.\
8:02\
As we conscientiously partake\
of the sacrament,\
8:05\
we invite the Holy Ghost into our lives,\
8:07\
just like when we were baptized\
and confirmed.\
8:11\
As we keep the covenant described\
in the sacrament prayers,\
8:15\
the Holy Ghost becomes our companion.\
8:19\
As the Holy Ghost exerts a greater\
influence in our lives,\
8:23\
we progressively and iteratively\
develop Christlike attributes.\
8:30\
Our hearts change. Our disposition\
to do evil diminishes.\
8:35\
Our inclination to do good increases\
until we only want “to do good\
8:41\
continually.” And we thereby access the\
heavenly power needed to endure to\
8:47\
the end. Our faith has increased, and\
we're ready to repeat the powerful,\
8:53\
virtuous cycle again. Forward\
8:57\
spiritual momentum also propels us to\
make additional covenants with God in\
9:02\
the house of the Lord. Multiple\
covenants draw us closer to Christ\
9:08\
and connect us more strongly to Him.\
9:12\
Through these covenants, we have\
greater access to His power.\
9:16\
To be clear, baptismal and temple\
covenants are not in and of themselves\
9:23\
the source of power. The\
source of power is\
9:28\
the Lord Jesus Christ and\
our Heavenly Father.\
9:32\
Making and keeping covenants creates a\
conduit for their power in our lives.\
9:39\
As we live according\
to these covenants,\
9:42\
we eventually become inheritors to\
all that Heavenly Father has.\
9:47\
The momentum produced by living the\
doctrine of Christ not only powers\
9:52\
the transformation of our divine nature\
into our eternal destiny,\
9:58\
but it also motivates us to help\
others in appropriate ways.\
10:03\
Consider how the expedition guide helped\
me after I flipped over in\
10:08\
the kayak. He didn’t shout from afar\
an unhelpful question such as,\
10:15\
“Mr. Renlund, what are you\
doing in the water?”\
10:19\
He didn’t paddle up and chide me,\
saying, “Mr. Renlund,\
10:23\
you wouldn’t be in this situation\
if you were more physically fit.”\
10:27\
He didn't start towing my kayak while I\
was just trying to get on top of it,\
10:32\
and he didn't correct me\
in front of the group.\
10:36\
Instead, he gave me the help I needed\
at the time I needed it.\
10:41\
He gave me advice when I was receptive.\
10:44\
And he went out of his\
way to encourage me.\
10:48\
As we minister to others,\
10:50\
we don't need to ask unhelpful questions\
or state the obvious.\
10:55\
Most people who are struggling\
know that they're struggling.\
11:00\
We shouldn't be judgmental.\
11:02\
Our judgment is neither\
helpful nor welcome,\
11:06\
and it is most often ill-informed.\
11:10\
Comparing ourselves to others can lead\
us to make pernicious errors,\
11:15\
especially if we conclude that we are\
more righteous than those who are\
11:20\
struggling. Such a comparison is like\
drowning hopelessly in three meters\
11:25\
of water, seeing someone else drowning\
in four meters of water,\
11:29\
judging him a greater sinner, and\
feeling good about yourself.\
11:35\
After all, we are all struggling in our\
own way. None of us earns salvation.\
11:41\
We never can. Jacob in the Book\
of Mormon taught, “Remember,\
11:46\
after [we] are reconciled unto God,\
11:49\
that it is only in and through the\
grace of God that [we] are saved.”\
11:53\
We all need the Savior’s infinite\
Atonement, not just part of it.\
12:01\
We do need all our compassion, empathy,\
12:04\
and love as we interact\
with those around us.\
12:08\
Those who are struggling\
“need to experience\
12:11\
the pure love of Jesus Christ reflected\
in [our] words and actions.”\
12:15\
As we minister, we encourage others\
frequently and offer help.\
12:21\
Even if someone isn’t receptive, we\
continue to minister as they allow.\
12:28\
The Savior taught that “unto such\
shall ye continue to minister;\
12:33\
for ye know not but what they\
will [repent and return],\
12:37\
and come unto me with full purpose\
of heart, and I shall heal them;\
12:42\
and ye shall be the means of bringing\
salvation unto them.”\
12:47\
The Savior's job is to heal.\
12:51\
Our job is to love—to love\
and minister in such\
12:56\
a way that others are drawn\
to Jesus Christ.\
13:01\
This is one of the fruits\
of the powerful,\
13:04\
virtuous cycle of the\
doctrine of Christ.\
13:09\
I invite you to live the doctrine\
of Christ repeatedly,\
13:14\
iteratively, and intentionally,\
and help others on their way.\
13:20\
I testify that the doctrine of Christ is\
central to Heavenly Father's plan.\
13:26\
It is, after all, His doctrine.\
13:29\
As we exercise faith in Jesus\
Christ and His Atonement,\
13:33\
we're propelled along the covenant path\
13:36\
and motivated to help others become\
faithful disciples of Jesus Christ.\
13:42\
We can become heirs in Heavenly\
Father's kingdom,\
13:45\
which is the culmination of faithfully\
living the doctrine of Christ.\
13:49\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
