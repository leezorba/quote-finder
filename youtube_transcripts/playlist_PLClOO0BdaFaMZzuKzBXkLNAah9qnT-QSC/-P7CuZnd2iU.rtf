My beloved brothers and sisters,\
0:03\
I pray that we may be\
spiritually renewed by\
0:08\
the inspired message from our leaders\
this weekend and rejoice in what\
0:13\
I love to call “covenant confidence\
through Jesus Christ.”\
0:18\
This confidence is the quiet\
0:20\
yet certain assurance of receiving\
the blessings that God promises\
0:25\
for those who keep their covenants\
and is so needed amid\
0:30\
the challenging circumstances\
of our day.\
0:34\
The construction of new houses\
of the Lord across the world,\
0:38\
under the inspired leadership of\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
0:43\
has caused great rejoicing among\
Church members and serves as\
0:48\
an important symbol of the expansion\
of the Lord’s Kingdom.\
0:53\
Reflecting on my awe experience\
0:57\
at the dedication of the Feather River\
California Temple last October,\
1:02\
I wondered if sometimes we get lost in\
1:05\
the excitement of having new\
temples in our cities\
1:09\
and communities and neglect\
the holy purpose of\
1:13\
the sacred covenants made in\
the temple. Inscribed\
1:17\
on the front of each temple is a\
solemn statement: “Holiness to\
1:22\
the Lord.” These inspired words are a\
clear invitation that when we enter\
1:29\
the Lord's house, we embark on\
1:31\
a sacred journey of learning to become\
higher and holier disciples of Christ.\
1:37\
As we make covenants in holiness before\
God and commit to follow the Savior,\
1:43\
we receive the power to change our\
hearts, renew our spirits,\
1:47\
and deepen our relationship with Him.\
1:50\
Such an endeavor brings sanctification\
to our souls and forms\
1:55\
a sacred bond with God and Jesus Christ,\
1:59\
who promise that we can inherit\
the gift of eternal life.\
2:04\
The result of this sacred journey\
is that we obtain a holier\
2:09\
and higher confidence for our day-to-\
day lives within our covenants made\
2:14\
through Jesus Christ.\
Such confidence is\
2:18\
the pinnacle of our divine\
connection with God,\
2:21\
and can help us increase our\
devotion to and gratitude\
2:27\
for Jesus Christ and His\
atoning sacrifice.\
2:30\
It fortifies our ability to\
love and serve others,\
2:34\
and it strengthens our souls to live in\
2:37\
an unholy world that is increasingly\
dark and discouraging.\
2:43\
It empowers us to overcome the\
seeds of doubt and despair,\
2:47\
fear and frustration, heartache\
and hopelessness that\
2:53\
the enemy tries to drive deep into our\
hearts, especially when life is hard,\
2:59\
trials are long, or circumstances\
are difficult.\
3:04\
A biblical verse offers sound advice\
for each of us as we lean into\
3:11\
the stiff wind of today's worldly\
challenges. Quote.\
3:16\
“Cast not away, therefore your\
confidence.” Close quote.\
3:22\
Dear brothers and sisters,\
3:24\
those who gain genuine confidence in\
the covenants made in the house of\
3:28\
the Lord through Jesus Christ\
3:30\
possess one of the most powerful\
forces that we can access in this life.\
3:38\
As we have studied the Book of\
Mormon in Come, Follow Me\
3:41\
this year, we have witnessed how\
Nephi beautifully exemplified\
3:47\
the power of this type of covenant\
confidence through his faithfulness\
3:52\
when he faced setbacks and challenges\
like getting the plates\
3:57\
as commanded by the Lord.\
3:59\
Nephi, despite being exceedingly\
sorrowful for the fear\
4:04\
and lack of faith of Laman and Lemuel,\
4:07\
remained confident that the Lord would\
deliver the plates to them.\
4:12\
He said unto his brothers, quote, “As\
the Lord liveth, and as we live,\
4:19\
we will not go down unto our father in\
4:22\
the wilderness until we have\
accomplished the thing which\
4:26\
the Lord hath commanded us.”\
End of quote.\
4:30\
Because of Nephi's confidence\
in the Lord's promises,\
4:33\
he was able to accomplish what\
he had been commanded to do.\
4:38\
Later in his vision, Nephi beheld the\
4:41\
influence of this type of confidence,\
writing, “I, Nephi,\
4:46\
beheld the power of the Lamb of God,\
that it descended upon the saints of\
4:51\
the church of the Lamb, and upon the\
covenant people of the Lord, ...\
4:56\
and they were armed with\
righteousness and with\
5:00\
the power of God in great glory.”\
5:05\
I have seen firsthand the Lord’s loving\
promises and power flowing into\
5:10\
the lives of God's children,\
5:12\
strengthening them to face\
life’s circumstances.\
5:15\
The other day, my wife came home\
after her worship in the temple\
5:20\
and told me how deeply touched she was\
5:28\
by what she experienced there.\
5:33\
As she entered the house of the Lord,\
5:35\
she saw a man in a wheelchair\
moving very slowly and\
5:41\
a woman walking with great\
difficulty using a cane,\
5:45\
both courageously coming to worship\
the Lord in His house.\
5:50\
As my wife walked into\
the initiatory area,\
5:53\
she saw a sweet sister who\
was missing one arm\
5:58\
and had only part of another\
arm beautifully\
6:01\
and celestially performing\
any tasks she was given.\
6:06\
As my wife and I talked\
about that experience,\
6:10\
we concluded that only pure and\
heartfelt confidence in\
6:16\
the eternal promises God\
provides through\
6:19\
the holy covenants made with Him in His\
house could cause those marvelous\
6:25\
disciples of Christ to leave their\
homes on that very freezing day,\
6:30\
despite their personal\
life circumstances.\
6:34\
My dear friends, if there is\
one thing we could possess\
6:39\
and one thing we could pass on to\
our children and grandchildren\
6:44\
that would help each in the\
tests and trials ahead,\
6:49\
it would be the confidence in the\
covenants made through Jesus Christ.\
6:54\
Obtaining such a divine possession\
will help them live as\
6:58\
the Lord promised His\
faithful followers:\
7:02\
“My disciples shall stand in holy\
places and shall not be moved.”\
7:08\
How do we gain such confidence\
through Jesus Christ?\
7:12\
It comes through humility,\
centering our lives on the Savior,\
7:18\
living by the principles of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ,\
7:21\
receiving the ordinances of\
salvation and exaltation,\
7:25\
and honoring the covenants we make\
with God in His holy house.\
7:30\
In his closing remarks at the October\
2019 General Conference,\
7:35\
our dear Prophet reminded us about\
7:37\
an important step in achieving covenant\
confidence, saying, quote,\
7:44\
“Individual worthiness to enter\
7:46\
the Lord’s house requires much\
individual spiritual preparation. ...\
7:51\
Individual worthiness requires\
a total conversion of mind\
7:55\
and heart to be more like the Lord,\
to be an honest citizen,\
8:00\
to be a better example, and to be\
a holier person.” End of quote.\
8:07\
Therefore, if we change our preparation\
to enter the temple,\
8:12\
we will change our experience in\
8:14\
the temple, which will transform our\
lives outside of the temple.\
8:20\
“Then shall thy confidence wax strong\
in the presence of God;\
8:25\
and the doctrine of the priesthood\
shall distill upon thy soul as the dews\
8:30\
from heaven.” A bishop I know refers\
to the oldest class in Primary not\
8:37\
as a “Primary” class but as a “temple\
preparation” class. In January,\
8:44\
the bishop has the class members and\
their teachers come to his office,\
8:48\
where they talk about\
how they will spend\
8:51\
the entire year preparing\
to enter the temple.\
8:55\
The bishop takes time to go through\
the applicable temple\
8:58\
recommend interview questions, which are\
then included in their Primary lessons.\
9:04\
He invites the children to be prepared\
so that when they come to\
9:11\
the bishop’s office in one year, they\
will be confident—covenant confident—\
9:17\
ready to receive a temple recommend\
and enter the Lord's house.\
9:22\
This year the bishop had four young\
girls who are so excited,\
9:28\
prepared, and confident to go to\
the temple that they want\
9:32\
the bishop to print their recommends\
on New Year’s Day at 12:01 a.m.\
9:40\
Preparation isn't just for those going\
to the temple for the first time.\
9:46\
We all should be perpetually preparing\
to go to the house of the Lord.\
9:51\
One stake I know has adopted\
the motto “home centered,\
9:56\
Church supported, and temple bound.”\
9:59\
“Bound” is an interesting word in that\
it means focused on a direction,\
10:05\
but it also means fastened or secured\
by; resolved and determined; sure.\
10:12\
So being temple bound secures\
us to the Savior,\
10:16\
gives us proper direction and stability\
while ensuring we have covenant\
10:22\
confidence through Jesus Christ.\
10:25\
Therefore, all of us should\
intentionally enhance such binding by\
10:32\
having our next appointment scheduled\
with the Lord in His holy house,\
10:36\
whether the temple is near or far away.\
10:39\
Our dear prophet, President\
Russell M. Nelson,\
10:42\
reminds us about this vital principles\
by saying, quote,\
10:47\
“The temple lies at the center\
of strengthening our faith\
10:51\
and its spiritual fortitude\
10:53\
because the Savior and His doctrine\
are the very heart of the temple.\
10:59\
Everything taught in the temple,\
11:01\
through instruction and through\
11:03\
the Spirit, increases our understanding\
of Jesus Christ.\
11:08\
His essential ordinances binds us to Him\
through sacred priesthood covenants.\
11:14\
Then, as we keep our covenants,\
He endows us with His healing,\
11:20\
strengthening power, and oh, how we all\
need His power in the days ahead!”\
11:27\
End of quote. The Savior desires that\
we become prepared to understand,\
11:34\
with great clarity, exactly how to act\
11:38\
as we make covenants with our\
Heavenly Father in His name.\
11:42\
He wants us to be prepared to experience\
our privileges, promises,\
11:48\
and responsibilities; To be prepared\
to have the spiritual insights\
11:52\
and awakenings that we\
need in this life.\
11:56\
I know that when the Lord sees\
even a spark of desire or\
12:02\
a flicker of righteous effort in our\
willingness to center our lives on Him\
12:08\
and on the ordinances and covenants\
we make in His house,\
12:12\
He will bless us in His perfect\
way with the miracles\
12:17\
and tender mercies we need.\
12:20\
The house of the Lord is where we\
can be transformed in higher\
12:25\
and holier ways. So when we\
walk out of the temple,\
12:29\
transformed by our hope in the\
promises of the covenants,\
12:34\
armed with the power from on high,\
12:37\
we take the temple with\
us into our homes and lives.\
12:42\
I assure you that having the Spirit of\
12:45\
the Lord's house in us changes\
us completely.\
12:51\
We also know from the temple that\
if we want the Spirit of\
12:54\
the Lord to be unrestrained\
in our lives,\
12:57\
we simply cannot and must not have\
unkind feelings toward anyone. Giving\
13:04\
place in our hearts or minds\
for unkind feelings\
13:07\
or thoughts will produce unkind\
words and actions,\
13:12\
whether on social media or in our homes,\
13:15\
causing the Spirit of the Lord\
to withdraw from our hearts.\
13:20\
Therefore, please “cast not\
away your confidence,”\
13:25\
but rather let your confidence\
wax strong.\
13:29\
The ongoing and accelerating building\
of temples will continue to excite\
13:34\
and inspire and bless us.\
13:36\
Yet more important, as we change our\
preparation to enter the temple,\
13:42\
we will change our experience in\
13:44\
the temple, which will transform our\
lives outside of the temple.\
13:49\
May this transformation fill us with\
confidence in our holy covenants made\
13:55\
with God through Jesus Christ.\
God lives.\
13:59\
Jesus is our Savior and this is\
His restored Church on earth.\
14:06\
I reverently declare these truths in\
the sacred name of our Savior,\
14:11\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
