In the closing hours of\
the Savior’s ministry,\
0:04\
He went to the Mount of Olives into\
a garden called Gethsemane\
0:08\
and invited His disciples to wait. Now\
alone, He petitioned His Father,\
0:16\
“If thou be willing, remove this\
cup from me.” Being in agony,\
0:22\
His suffering caused him, “even God,\
the greatest of all,\
0:27\
to tremble because of pain and\
to bleed at every pore, ...\
0:32\
and would that [He] might not drink\
the bitter cup, and shrink.”\
0:39\
Yet in the moment of deep despair,\
the Savior did not shrink,\
0:44\
“but partook and finished [His]\
preparations unto the children of men.”\
0:50\
As the Only Begotten of the Father,\
0:52\
Jesus Christ had power over death, pain,\
and suffering, but did not shrink.\
1:00\
He fulfilled the covenant He’d\
made with His Father,\
1:03\
and in doing so manifest a Christlike\
attribute increasingly important in\
1:10\
the world in which we live—the\
attribute of integrity.\
1:15\
He remained true to God, to each of us,\
and to His divine identity.\
1:23\
Jesus Christ is our exemplar.\
1:27\
Living a life of integrity requires us\
to be true to God, to each other,\
1:33\
and to our divine identity.\
1:37\
Integrity flows from the first great\
commandment to love God.\
1:41\
Because you love God, you are\
true to Him at all times.\
1:46\
You understand that there is right and\
wrong and there is absolute truth,\
1:53\
God's truth. Integrity means we\
do not lower our standards\
1:58\
or behavior to impress or to\
be accepted by others.\
2:03\
You do what is right and let\
the consequence follow.\
2:08\
Recent revisions to the Preach My Gospel\
Missionary Manual notably added\
2:14\
integrity as a Christlike attribute.\
2:18\
A number of years ago, Elder Uchtdorf\
was assigned to reorganize our stake.\
2:25\
During our interview, he asked me\
a question I have not forgotten:\
2:30\
“Has there been anything in your life\
that, if brought to the attention of\
2:34\
the public, would be an embarrassment\
to you or the Church?”\
2:40\
Surprised, my mind quickly raced\
over my entire life,\
2:46\
trying to recall those moments\
when I may have fallen short,\
2:50\
and asking myself if others knew\
everything I had done,\
2:56\
what would they think of me or\
the Church? In the moment,\
3:02\
I thought Elder Uchtdorf was only\
asking about worthiness,\
3:06\
but I've come to understand it was\
really a question about integrity.\
3:12\
Was I true to what I professed?\
3:16\
Would the world see consistency\
between my words and my deeds?\
3:22\
Would others see God through my conduct?\
President Spencer W. Kimball taught,\
3:30\
“Integrity is our willingness and\
ability to live by our beliefs and\
3:34\
our commitments.” A life of integrity\
requires us to first\
3:40\
and foremost be true to God.\
3:43\
From our early childhood, we learned the\
story of Daniel in the lion's den.\
3:48\
Daniel was always true\
to God. His jealous\
3:53\
peers sought to find occasion\
against him and contrived\
3:57\
a decree mandating prayers\
to their gods alone.\
4:01\
Daniel knew of the decree, but went\
home—and with “his windows being open”—\
4:08\
knelt and prayed three times\
a day to the God of Israel.\
4:14\
As a result, Daniel was cast\
into the lion's den.\
4:20\
On the morn, the king found Daniel's\
God had delivered him and issued\
4:25\
a new decree that all should “tremble\
and fear before the God of Daniel,\
4:32\
for he is the living God.” The king came\
to know God through Daniel’s integrity.\
4:41\
Others see God through\
ours—words and deeds.\
4:47\
Just like Daniel, being true to God will\
increasingly set us apart from the\
4:53\
world. The Savior reminds us that “in\
the world ye shall have tribulation:\
5:00\
but be of good cheer; I have\
overcome the world.”\
5:05\
President Nelson counseled\
5:07\
that “[overcoming the world]\
means overcoming\
5:10\
the temptation to care more about\
the things of this world than\
5:14\
the things of God. It means trusting\
the doctrine of Christ more than\
5:19\
the philosophies of men.” Likewise,\
5:23\
we must resist the temptation\
to walk “in [our] own way after\
5:29\
the image of [our] own God, whose image\
is in the likeness of the world.”\
5:35\
The oppositional pull of this world is\
5:38\
an essential part of God's\
plan of salvation.\
5:41\
How we respond to the pull is\
the essence of who we are,\
5:46\
a measure of our integrity.\
5:49\
The worldly pull can be as direct as\
to destroy fidelity in marriage,\
5:54\
or as subtle as posting anonymous\
comments critical of Church doctrine\
5:59\
or culture. Exercising integrity in our\
choices is an outward expression of\
6:06\
an inner commitment to follow\
the Savior, Jesus Christ.\
6:12\
Just as integrity flows from the first\
great commandment to love God,\
6:16\
being true to each other flows from\
the second, to love our neighbors\
6:21\
as ourselves. A life of integrity\
is not a life of perfection.\
6:27\
It is a life in which we strive every\
day to foremost be true to God,\
6:32\
and within that context,\
to be true to others.\
6:37\
President Oaks reminds\
us, “Our zeal to keep\
6:40\
the second commandment must not\
cause us to forget the first.”\
6:46\
The world increasingly grapples with\
integrity by imposing codes of conduct\
6:52\
or ethical rules that govern the\
relationships between people\
6:56\
and institutions. While good,\
6:59\
these rules are generally not\
anchored in absolute truth\
7:03\
and tend to evolve based\
on cultural acceptance.\
7:08\
Similar to the question posed\
by Elder Uchtdorf,\
7:11\
some organizations train employees\
to consider what their decisions\
7:16\
or decision-making process would look\
like if published online or on\
7:22\
the front page of a major newspaper.\
7:26\
As the Church comes out of obscurity\
and darkness, we, like Daniel,\
7:32\
must rise above the worldly expectations\
and become the face of\
7:38\
the true and living God at all\
times and in all places.\
7:44\
Saying we have integrity is insufficient\
if our actions are\
7:49\
inconsistent with our words.\
7:52\
Likewise, Christian kindness is not\
a substitute for integrity.\
8:00\
As a covenant people and as\
leaders of His Church,\
8:05\
we must be beyond reproach and aligned\
with the standards the Lord has set.\
8:12\
Acting with integrity builds\
faith and trust\
8:15\
and reassures others that we seek\
only to do the will of the Lord.\
8:21\
In our councils, we resist outside\
influences and follow\
8:26\
the Lord's revealed process,\
8:27\
seeking insights from each woman and\
man and acting consistent with\
8:33\
the inspired counsel received.\
8:36\
Our focus is on the Savior,\
8:39\
and we are careful to avoid actions\
that may be perceived\
8:44\
as serving our own interests,\
benefiting our family,\
8:49\
or favoring someone at the\
expense of another.\
8:53\
We go out of our way to avoid any\
perception that our actions may be\
8:59\
influenced by the honors of men, to\
receive personal recognition,\
9:05\
generate more likes, to be\
quoted or published.\
9:11\
Finally, a life of integrity requires us\
to be true to our divine identity.\
9:19\
We know some who were not.\
9:22\
Of particular significance is\
the anti-Christ Korihor,\
9:27\
who led away the hearts of many\
appealing to their “carnal mind.”\
9:32\
Yet in the final moments of his life,\
9:36\
he confessed, “I always knew that there\
was a God.” President Eyring\
9:43\
has taught that lying “is contrary\
to the nature of our spirits,”\
9:49\
our divine identity. Korihor deceived\
himself and the truth was not in him.\
9:58\
In contrast, the Prophet Joseph Smith\
confidently proclaimed, “I knew it,\
10:06\
and I knew that God knew it,\
and I could not deny it.”\
10:12\
Joseph’s brother Hyrum was\
loved by the Lord “because\
10:15\
the integrity of his heart.”\
10:17\
He and Joseph remained true to the end—\
true to their divine identity,\
10:23\
the light and knowledge they received,\
10:27\
and true to the person they\
knew they could become.\
10:31\
May we reconcile ourselves to\
the will of God and develop\
10:38\
the Christlike attribute of integrity.\
May we follow our Exemplar,\
10:44\
the Savior of the world, and not shrink,\
10:49\
but live a life that is true to God, to\
each other, and to our divine identity.\
10:56\
As Job said, ’Let me be weighed in an\
even balance that God may know mine\
11:04\
integrity.” In the sacred name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
