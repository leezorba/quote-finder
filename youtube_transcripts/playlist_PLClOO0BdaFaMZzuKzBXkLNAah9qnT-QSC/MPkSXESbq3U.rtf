Today, I would like to\
begin by testifying of\
0:04\
the complete certainty within my heart\
that God hears our prayers\
0:08\
and answers them in a personalized\
way. In a world\
0:12\
going through times of uncertainty,\
pain, disappointment, and heartbreak,\
0:17\
we might feel inclined to rely more on\
personal abilities and preferences,\
0:22\
as well as the knowledge and security\
that comes from the world.\
0:27\
This could cause us to\
put in the background\
0:30\
the real source of succor and\
support that can counter\
0:34\
the challenges of this mortal life.\
0:37\
I remember an occasion when I was\
hospitalized for an illness\
0:41\
and it was difficult for me to sleep.\
0:43\
When I turned off the lights\
and the room became dark,\
0:47\
I saw a reflective sign on the ceiling\
in front of me that said, “Call,\
0:52\
don’t fall.” To my surprise,\
0:55\
the next day I observed the same message\
repeated in several parts of\
1:00\
the room. Why was that\
message so important?\
1:04\
When I asked the nurse about it,\
1:05\
she said, “It is to prevent a\
blow that might increase\
1:09\
the pain you already have.”\
1:11\
This life, by its nature, brings\
painful experiences,\
1:15\
some inherent to our physical bodies,\
1:18\
some due to our weaknesses\
or afflictions,\
1:21\
some due to the way others\
use their agency,\
1:24\
and some due to our use of agency.\
1:28\
Is there a promise more\
powerful than the one the\
1:30\
Savior Himself made when He declared,\
“Ask, and it shall be given you;\
1:36\
seek and ye shall find; knock,” or call,\
“and it shall be opened unto you”?\
1:43\
Prayer is the means of communication\
with our Heavenly Father that allows\
1:47\
us to “Call, and don’t fall.”\
1:50\
However, there are circumstances\
in which we might think that\
1:55\
the call has not been heard because we\
do not receive an immediate response\
1:59\
or one according to our expectations.\
2:02\
This sometimes leads to anxiety,\
sadness, or disappointment.\
2:08\
But remember Nephi's expression of the\
faith in the Lord when he said,\
2:12\
“How is that he cannot instruct\
me, that I should build a ship?”\
2:17\
Now I ask you, how is it the Lord can\
not instruct you that you do not fall?\
2:24\
Confidence in God’s answers implies\
accepting that His ways are not our\
2:29\
ways, and that “all things must\
come to pass in their time.”\
2:34\
The certainty of knowing that\
we are children of a loving\
2:37\
and merciful Heavenly Father should be\
2:40\
the motivation to call in devout prayer\
with an attitude of “pray[ing] always,\
2:45\
and not faint[ing]; ... that [our]\
performance may be for the welfare of\
2:51\
of [our] souls.”\
Imagine the feelings of Heavenly Father\
2:53\
when in each prayer we make a\
supplication in the name of His Son,\
2:57\
Jesus Christ. What power and tenderness,\
3:00\
I believe, are displayed when we do so!\
3:04\
The scriptures are full of examples\
of those who called out to God\
3:07\
so they would not fall.\
Helaman and his army,\
3:11\
while facing their afflictions,\
called upon God,\
3:14\
pouring out their souls in prayer.\
3:17\
They received assurance, peace, faith,\
and hope,\
3:21\
gaining courage and determination\
until they achieved their goal.\
3:25\
Imagine how Moses would have called and\
3:28\
cried out to God when finding himself\
between the Red Sea and the Egyptians\
3:32\
approaching to attack, or\
Abraham when obeying\
3:36\
the mandate to sacrifice his son Isaac.\
3:40\
I am certain that each of you have had\
3:44\
and will have experiences where calling\
will be the answer to not fall.\
3:50\
Thirty years ago, while my wife and I\
were preparing for our civil marriage\
3:54\
and our temple marriage, we received\
3:56\
a call informing us that civil marriages\
were canceled due to\
4:01\
a strike. We received the call three\
days before the scheduled ceremony.\
4:06\
After several attempts at other offices\
and not finding available appointments,\
4:10\
we began to feel distressed\
4:12\
and doubtful that we really could\
get married as planned.\
4:16\
My fiancé and I called, pouring\
our souls to God in prayer.\
4:22\
Finally, someone told us about an\
office in a small town on the\
4:27\
on the outskirts of the city where\
an acquaintance was the mayor.\
4:32\
Without hesitation, we\
went to visit him\
4:34\
and asked him if it would be possible\
to marry us. To our joy, he agreed.\
4:39\
His secretary emphasized to\
us that we had to obtain\
4:43\
a certificate in that city and deliver\
all the documents before noon\
4:47\
the next day. The next day we moved\
to the small town and went to\
4:52\
the police station to request\
the required document.\
4:55\
To our surprise, the officer said that\
he would not give it to us because\
5:00\
many young couples had been running\
away from their families to get married\
5:04\
secretly in that town, which\
of course was not our case.\
5:09\
Again, fear and sadness overtook us.\
5:13\
I remember how I silently called out to\
my Heavenly Father so as not to fall.\
5:19\
I received a clear impression in\
my mind, repeatedly saying,\
5:24\
“Temple recommend, temple recommend.”\
5:26\
I immediately took out my temple\
recommend and handed it to the officer,\
5:30\
to my fiancée's bewilderment.\
5:33\
What a surprise we had when\
we heard the officer say,\
5:36\
“Why didn’t you tell me that you are\
from The Church of Jesus Christ of\
5:39\
Latter-day Saints? I know\
your Church well.”\
5:42\
So he immediately began to\
prepare the document.\
5:45\
We were even more surprised\
when the officer left\
5:48\
the station without saying anything.\
5:51\
Fifty minutes passed\
and he did not return.\
5:55\
It was already 11:55 in the morning, and\
we only had until noon to deliver\
6:00\
the papers. Suddenly he appeared with\
a beautiful puppy and told us it was\
6:06\
a wedding gift and gave it to\
us along with the document.\
6:11\
We ran toward the mayor's office with\
our document and our new dog.\
6:16\
Then we saw an official vehicle coming\
toward us. I stopped in front of it.\
6:24\
The vehicle stopped and we\
saw the secretary inside.\
6:28\
Seeing us, she said, “I’m sorry. I told\
you noon. I must go on another errand.”\
6:36\
I humbled myself in silence, calling\
with all my heart to my Heavenly Father,\
6:44\
asking for help once again to not fall.\
Suddenly, the miracle happened.\
6:50\
The secretary said to us, “What\
a beautiful dog you have.\
6:54\
Where could I find one like that\
for my son?” “It’s for you,”\
6:59\
we immediately replied.\
7:04\
The secretary looked at us with\
surprise and said, “Okay,\
7:07\
let’s go to the office and\
make the arrangements.”\
7:12\
Two days later, Carol and I were\
married civilly as planned,\
7:15\
and then we were sealed in\
the Lima Peru Temple.\
7:19\
Of course, we need to remember that\
calling is a matter of faith\
7:23\
and action—faith to recognize\
that we have\
7:26\
a Heavenly Father who answers our\
prayers according to His infinite\
7:30\
wisdom, and then action consistent\
with what we ask for. Praying,\
7:37\
“calling,” can be a sign of our hope,\
7:41\
but taking action after praying is\
a sign that our faith is real—\
7:46\
faith that is tested in moments of pain,\
fear, or disappointment.\
7:51\
I suggest you consider the following.\
7:54\
First, always think of the Lord\
as your first option for help.\
8:00\
Then second, “Call,\
8:03\
don’t fall.”\
8:04\
Turn to God in sincere prayer.\
8:07\
Third, after praying, do all you can to\
obtain the blessings you pray for.\
8:14\
Fourth, humble yourselves to accept the\
answer in His time and His way.\
8:19\
And fifth, don't stop. Keep\
moving forward on\
8:24\
the covenant path while you\
wait for an answer.\
8:28\
Perhaps there is someone right now who,\
due to circumstances,\
8:32\
feels like they are about to fall\
and would like to call like\
8:37\
Joseph Smith did when he cried out,\
“Oh God, what are thou? ...\
8:43\
How long shall thy hand be stayed?”\
8:47\
Even in circumstances such as these,\
pray with the “spiritual momentum,”\
8:51\
as President Nelson taught. Because\
your prayers are always heard.\
8:56\
Remember this hymn: “Ere you left your\
room this morning, Did you think to\
9:03\
pray? In the\
9:05\
name of Christ, our\
9:06\
Savior,\
9:07\
Did you sue for loving favor\
as a shield today?\
9:12\
Oh, how praying rests the weary! Prayer\
will change the night to day.\
9:18\
So when life gets dark and dreary,\
Don’t forget to pray.” As we\
9:25\
pray,\
9:26\
we can feel the embrace of\
our Heavenly Father,\
9:30\
who sent His Only Begotten Son\
to relieve our burdens,\
9:34\
because if we call out to God,\
I testify, we will not fall.\
9:41\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
