I’d like to express gratitude\
for your prayers\
0:03\
as I’ve started the process\
of adjusting to\
0:07\
the call through President Nelson\
to serve as an apostle of\
0:11\
the Lord Jesus Christ. You can probably\
well imagine how humbling this has\
0:16\
felt, and that it's been a time\
of extraordinary upheaval\
0:19\
and sobering self-examination.\
0:23\
It is, however, and indeed\
a great honor to serve\
0:28\
the Savior in any capacity and to\
be engaged with you in sharing\
0:34\
the good news of His gospel of hope.\
0:39\
Beyond that, it's been said that\
behind every new apostle stands\
0:45\
an astonished mother-in-law.\
0:53\
I don't know if that has actually\
been said, but in this case,\
0:57\
it certainly could be.\
And I suspect that\
1:01\
the fact that my mother-in-law is no\
longer with us does nothing to reduce\
1:05\
her astonishment.\
1:09\
Several months ago, when my wife and\
I were visiting another country\
1:13\
for various Church assignments,\
1:15\
I woke up early one morning and\
blearily looked outside\
1:19\
the hotel window. Down below,\
on the busy street,\
1:23\
I saw that a roadblock\
had been set up with\
1:26\
a policeman stationed nearby to turn\
cars around as they reached\
1:30\
the barrier. At first, only a few\
cars traveled along the road\
1:35\
and were turned back. But as time\
went by and traffic increased,\
1:40\
queues of cars began to build up.\
1:43\
From the window above, I watched as\
1:46\
the policeman seemed to take\
satisfaction in his power to block\
1:50\
the flow of traffic and\
turn people away.\
1:53\
In fact, he seemed to develop\
a spring in his step,\
1:55\
as if he might start doing a little jig\
as each car approached the barrier.\
2:02\
If a driver got frustrated\
about the roadblock,\
2:06\
the policeman didn't appear\
helpful or sympathetic.\
2:09\
He just shook his head and repeatedly\
pointed in the opposite direction.\
2:15\
My friends, my fellow disciples\
on the road of mortal life,\
2:21\
our Father’s beautiful plan,\
even His fabulous plan,\
2:26\
is designed to bring you home,\
not to keep you out.\
2:33\
No one has built a roadblock\
2:36\
and stationed someone there to turn\
you around and send you away.\
2:41\
In fact, it's the exact opposite. God\
is in relentless pursuit of you.\
2:51\
He wants all of His children\
to choose to return to Him,\
2:56\
and He employs every possible\
measure to bring you back.\
3:02\
Our loving Father oversaw the creation\
of this very Earth for\
3:07\
the express purpose of providing\
an opportunity for you and\
3:10\
for me to have the stretching and\
refining experiences of mortality,\
3:16\
the chance to use our God-\
given moral agency,\
3:20\
to choose Him, to learn and grow,\
to make mistakes, to repent,\
3:26\
to love God and our neighbor, and\
to one day return to Him.\
3:32\
He sent His precious, beloved Son\
to this fallen world to live\
3:37\
the full range of human experience,\
3:39\
to provide an example for the rest of\
His children to follow, and to atone\
3:44\
and redeem. Christ's great atoning gift\
removes every roadblock of physical\
3:53\
and spiritual death that would separate\
us from our eternal home.\
3:59\
Everything about the Father’s plan\
4:02\
for His beloved children is designed\
to bring everyone home.\
4:11\
What do God’s messengers, His prophets,\
call this plan in Restoration scripture?\
4:16\
They call it the plan of redemption,\
the plan of mercy,\
4:22\
the great plan of happiness,\
and the plan of salvation,\
4:27\
which is unto all, “through the\
blood of mine Only Begotten.”\
4:33\
The intent of the Father’s great plan\
of happiness is your happiness—right\
4:41\
here, right now, and in the eternities.\
4:45\
It is not to prevent your happiness and\
cause you instead worry and fear.\
4:52\
The intent of the Father’s plan of\
redemption is, in fact, your redemption.\
5:00\
You're being rescued through\
the sufferings\
5:04\
and death of Jesus Christ, freed from\
captivity of sin and death.\
5:09\
It is not to leave you as you are.\
5:12\
The intent of the Father’s plan\
of mercy is to extend mercy\
5:19\
as you turn back to Him, and honor your\
covenant and fidelity to Him.\
5:24\
It is not to deny mercy and inflict\
pain and sorrow. The intent\
5:33\
of the Father’s plan of salvation\
is in fact your salvation in\
5:41\
the celestial kingdom of glory\
5:42\
as you receive the testimony of Jesus\
Christ and offer your whole soul to\
5:47\
Him. It is not to keep you out.\
Does this mean\
5:54\
anything goes with regard to\
how we live our lives?\
5:58\
That the way we choose to use our agency\
doesn’t matter? That we can take\
6:02\
or leave God’s commandments? No,\
of course not.\
6:06\
Surely one of Jesus's most\
consistent invitations\
6:10\
and pleas during His mortal ministry\
was that we change and repent\
6:14\
and come unto Him. Fundamentally\
implicit in all of His teachings\
6:19\
to live on a higher plane\
of moral conduct is\
6:22\
a call to personal progression, to\
transformative faith in Christ,\
6:27\
to a mighty change of heart.\
6:30\
God wants for us a radical reorientation\
of our selfish\
6:36\
and prideful impulses, the eviction\
of the natural man, for us to go\
6:42\
and sin no more. If we\
believe the intent of the\
6:47\
Father’s all-reaching plan is to save\
us, redeem us, extend mercy to us,\
6:53\
and thereby bring us happiness.\
6:55\
What is the intent of the Son through\
whom the great plan is brought about?\
7:01\
The Son tells us Himself:\
7:04\
“For I came down from heaven,\
not to do mine own will,\
7:08\
but the will of him that sent me.”\
7:12\
Jesus’s will is the benevolent\
Father’s will!\
7:16\
He wants to make it possible\
7:17\
for every last one of His Father’s\
children to receive the end goal of\
7:23\
the plan: eternal life with Them. None\
is excluded from this divine potential.\
7:32\
If you are prone to worry that\
you will never measure up,\
7:36\
or that the loving reach of Christ’s\
infinite Atonement mercifully covers\
7:41\
everyone else but not you, then you\
misunderstand. Infinite means infinite.\
7:50\
Infinite covers you and those you love.\
7:54\
Nephi explains this beautiful\
truth: “He doeth not anything\
7:59\
save it be for the benefit of the world;\
for he loveth the world,\
8:03\
even that he layeth down his own life,\
that he may draw all men unto him.\
8:08\
Wherefore, he commandeth none that they\
shall not partake of his salvation.”\
8:14\
The Savior, the Good Shepherd,\
8:17\
goes in search of His lost sheep\
until He finds them.\
8:23\
He's not willing that any should perish.\
8:26\
“Mine arm of mercy is extended\
towards you,\
8:29\
and whosoever will come,\
him will I receive.”\
8:34\
“Have ye any that are sick among you?\
Bring them hither.\
8:37\
Have ye any that are lame, or blind,\
or halt, or maimed, or leprous,\
8:42\
or that are withered, or that are deaf,\
or that are afflicted in any manner?\
8:48\
Bring them hither, and I will heal them,\
for I have compassion upon you.”\
8:56\
He did not cast away the woman\
with the issue of blood.\
9:00\
He did not recoil from the leper.\
9:02\
He did not reject the woman\
taken in adultery.\
9:05\
He did not refuse the penitent,\
no matter their sin.\
9:09\
And He will not refuse you\
or those you love\
9:13\
when you bring to Him your broken\
hearts and contrite spirits.\
9:17\
That is not His intent or design, nor\
His plan, purpose, wish, or hope.\
9:26\
No, He does not put up roadblocks\
and barriers; He removes them.\
9:33\
He does not keep you out;\
He welcomes you in.\
9:36\
His entire ministry was a living\
declaration of this intent.\
9:41\
Then, of course, there is His\
atoning sacrifice itself,\
9:46\
which is harder for us to understand,\
beyond our mortal capacity to\
9:50\
comprehend. But—and this is an important\
“but”—we do understand,\
9:57\
can comprehend the holy saving intent\
of His atoning sacrifice.\
10:06\
The veil of the temple was rent in twain\
when Jesus died upon the cross,\
10:14\
symbolizing that access back\
to the presence of\
10:18\
the Father had been ripped wide open to\
all who will turn to Him, trust Him,\
10:24\
cast their burdens on Him, and take His\
yoke upon them in a covenant bond.\
10:31\
In other words, the Father’s plan is\
not about roadblocks. It never was.\
10:39\
It never will be. Are there\
things we need to do,\
10:43\
commandments to keep, aspects\
of our natures to change?\
10:45\
Yes, but with His grace those are within\
our reach, not beyond our grasp.\
10:51\
This is the good news. I am unspeakably\
grateful for these simple truths.\
10:58\
The Father’s design, His plan, His\
purpose, His intent, His wish,\
11:03\
and His hope are all to heal\
you, all to give you peace,\
11:08\
all to bring you and those you love\
home. Of this I am a witness.\
11:14\
In the name of Jesus Christ,\
His Son, amen.\
