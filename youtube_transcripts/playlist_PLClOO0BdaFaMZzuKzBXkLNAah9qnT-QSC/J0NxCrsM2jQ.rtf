In 1832, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon\
received a remarkable vision concerning\
0:08\
the destiny of God's children.\
0:11\
This revelation spoke of three heavenly\
kingdoms. President Dallin H. Oaks\
0:16\
spoke about these kingdoms\
of glory last October,\
0:20\
noting that “through the triumph\
and the glory of the Lamb,”\
0:24\
all but a relatively few individuals\
are eventually redeemed into one of\
0:29\
these kingdoms “according to\
0:31\
the desires manifested through\
their choices.”\
0:36\
God's plan of redemption constitutes\
a universal opportunity\
0:40\
for all His children, whenever and\
wherever they may have lived\
0:44\
on the Earth. While the glory of even\
the least of the three kingdoms,\
0:50\
the telestial, “surpasses\
all understanding,”\
0:54\
our Father’s hope is that\
we will choose—\
0:57\
and through the grace of His Son\
0:59\
qualify for—the highest and most\
glorious of these kingdoms,\
1:03\
the celestial, where we may enjoy\
eternal life as joint heirs with Christ.\
1:09\
President Russell M. Nelson has\
urged us to “think celestial,”\
1:13\
making the celestial kingdom\
our eternal goal and\
1:16\
then “carefully considering where\
each of [our] decisions while here\
1:22\
on earth will place [us]\
in the next world.”\
1:26\
Those in the celestial kingdom are “they\
who received the testimony of Jesus,...\
1:31\
who are just men made perfect through\
Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.”\
1:36\
The inhabitants of the second, or\
terrestrial, kingdom are described\
1:40\
as essentially good, including\
the “honorable men of\
1:44\
the earth, who were blinded\
by the craftiness of men.”\
1:47\
Their principal limiting trait is\
that they “are not valiant in\
1:52\
the testimony of Jesus.” By contrast,\
1:55\
those in the lower telestial kingdom are\
those who “received not the gospel,\
2:01\
neither the testimony of Jesus.”\
2:04\
Note that the distinguishing\
characteristic for\
2:07\
the inhabitants of each kingdom is how\
they relate to “the testimony of Jesus,”\
2:13\
ranging from whole-hearted devotion to\
not being valiant to outright rejection.\
2:21\
On each person’s reaction hangs\
his or her eternal future.\
2:27\
What is the testimony of Jesus?\
2:31\
It is the witness of the Holy Spirit\
that He is the divine Son of God,\
2:34\
the Messiah and Redeemer.\
2:37\
It is John's testimony that Jesus\
was in the beginning with God,\
2:41\
the Creator of heaven and earth,\
2:43\
and “in him was the gospel, and\
the gospel was the life,\
2:47\
and the life was the light of men.”\
2:50\
It “is the testimony of the Apostles and\
Prophets, ... that He died, was buried,\
2:54\
and rose again the third day\
and ascended into heaven.”\
2:58\
It is the knowledge that “there is no\
other name given whereby salvation\
3:02\
cometh.” It is the “testimony, last of\
all,” given by the Prophet Joseph Smith\
3:07\
“That he lives! ... [T]hat\
3:10\
he is the Only Begotten\
of the Father—That\
3:12\
by him, and through him, and of him,\
the worlds are and were created,\
3:17\
and the inhabitants thereof are begotten\
sons and daughters unto God.”\
3:22\
Beyond this testimony is the question:\
what do we do about it?\
3:28\
The inheritors of the celestial kingdom\
receive the testimony of Jesus in\
3:33\
the fullest sense by being baptized,\
receiving the Holy Ghost,\
3:38\
and overcoming by faith.\
3:40\
The principles and truths of the gospel\
of Jesus Christ govern their priorities\
3:45\
and choices. The testimony of Jesus\
is manifest in what they are\
3:51\
and what they are becoming.\
3:53\
Their focus is on pursuing “the\
measure of the stature of\
3:56\
the fulness of Christ.” At least some\
of those who will be found in\
4:02\
the terrestrial kingdom also accept\
the testimony of Jesus,\
4:06\
but they are distinguished by what\
they don’t do about it.\
4:10\
Not being valiant in the witness of the\
Savior suggests a degree of apathy or\
4:15\
casualness—being “lukewarm”—as opposed\
to the people of Ammon in\
4:20\
the Book of Mormon, for example,\
4:21\
who were “distinguished for\
their zeal towards God.”\
4:26\
The inhabitants of the telestial\
kingdom are those who reject\
4:29\
the testimony of Jesus, along with His\
gospel, His covenants, and His prophets.\
4:35\
They're described by Abinadi\
4:37\
as “having gone according to their\
own carnal wills and desires;\
4:41\
having never called upon the Lord\
4:43\
while the arms of mercy were\
extended towards them;\
4:46\
for the arms of mercy were extended\
towards them, and they would not.”\
4:52\
What does it mean to be valiant\
in the testimony of Jesus?\
4:57\
There are several possibilities that\
could be considered in answering this\
4:59\
question. I'll mention a few.\
5:02\
Being valiant in the testimony of\
Jesus surely includes nurturing\
5:06\
and strengthening that testimony.\
5:09\
True disciples do not ignore the\
seemingly small things that sustain\
5:13\
and strengthen their testimony\
of Jesus, such as prayer,\
5:17\
study of the scriptures, Sabbath\
observance, partaking of the sacrament,\
5:22\
repentance, ministering, and worship\
in the house of the Lord.\
5:27\
President Nelson reminds us that,\
quote, “with frightening speed,\
5:32\
a testimony that is not nourished daily\
‘by the good word of God’ can crumble.\
5:37\
Thus, ... we need daily experiences\
worshiping the Lord\
5:40\
and studying His gospel.” Then he added,\
5:43\
“I plead with you to let God\
prevail in your life.\
5:47\
Give Him a fair share of your time.\
5:49\
As you do, notice what happens to\
your positive spiritual momentum.”\
5:55\
Being valiant also suggests being open\
and public about one's witness.\
6:00\
In baptism, we confirm our\
willingness “to stand\
6:03\
as witnesses of God at all\
times and in all things\
6:06\
and in all places that [we] may be in,\
even until death.” In this Easter\
6:12\
season especially,\
6:13\
we joyfully, publicly, and unreservedly\
proclaim our witness of\
6:19\
the resurrected, living Christ.\
6:23\
One aspect of being valiant in\
6:25\
the testimony of Jesus is\
to heed His messengers.\
6:30\
God does not force us into the better\
path, the covenant path,\
6:35\
but He instructs His prophets\
to make us fully aware of\
6:39\
the consequences of our choices. And\
it’s not just the members of His Church.\
6:45\
Through His prophets and apostles,\
6:47\
He lovingly pleads with\
all the world to heed\
6:51\
the truth that will make them free,\
spare them needless suffering,\
6:56\
and bring them enduring joy.\
Being valiant in\
7:01\
the testimony of Jesus means\
encouraging others, by word\
7:05\
and example, to likewise be valiant,\
especially those of our own families.\
7:12\
Elder Neal A. Maxwell once\
addressed, quote,\
7:15\
“the essentially ‘honorable’\
members [of the Church]\
7:19\
who are skimming over the surface\
instead of deepening their discipleship\
7:25\
who are casually engaged rather\
than ‘anxiously engaged.’”\
7:30\
Noting that all are free to choose,\
Elder Maxwell lamented,\
7:34\
“Unfortunately, however, when\
some choose slackness,\
7:39\
they're choosing not only\
for themselves but for\
7:41\
the next generation and the next.\
7:44\
Small equivocations in parents can\
produce large deviations in their\
7:50\
children. Each generation in a family\
or earlier generations in\
7:55\
a family may have reflected dedication,\
7:59\
while some in the current generation\
evidence equivocation. Sadly, in the\
8:05\
next, some\
8:06\
may choose dissension as erosion takes\
its toll.” Years ago, Elder John H.\
8:14\
Groberg related the story of\
a young family living in\
8:17\
a small branch in Hawaii\
in the early 1900s.\
8:22\
They’d been members of the Church\
for about two years\
8:25\
when one of their daughters fell\
ill with an undiagnosed disease\
8:29\
and was hospitalized. At\
church the next Sunday,\
8:33\
the father and his son prepared the\
sacrament, as they did most weeks.\
8:39\
But as the young father knelt to bless\
the bread, the branch president,\
8:44\
suddenly realizing who was\
at the sacrament table,\
8:48\
jumped up and cried, “Stop! You\
can’t touch the sacrament.\
8:53\
Your daughter has an unknown disease.\
8:55\
Leave immediately while someone else\
fixes new sacrament bread.\
8:59\
We can't have you here.\
9:01\
Go!”\
9:03\
The stunned father searchingly looked\
at the branch president and then\
9:07\
the congregation, and sensing\
the depth of anxiety\
9:11\
and embarrassment from all,\
motioned to his family,\
9:15\
and they quietly filed\
out of the chapel.\
9:19\
Not a word was said as dejectedly\
9:21\
the family walked along the\
trail to their small home.\
9:26\
There they sat in a circle,\
and the father said,\
9:29\
“Please be silent until\
I’m ready to speak.”\
9:34\
The young son wondered what they\
would do to get revenge for\
9:37\
the shame they had suffered:\
9:39\
would they kill the branch\
president’s pigs,\
9:43\
or burn his house or join\
another church? Five,\
9:49\
10, 15, 25 minutes passed in silence.\
9:55\
The father's clenched fists began to\
relax and tears formed in his eyes.\
10:00\
The mother began to cry, and soon each\
of the children was quietly weeping.\
10:05\
The father turned to his wife\
and said, “I love you.”\
10:09\
and then repeated those words\
to each of their children.\
10:13\
“I love all of you, and I want\
us to be together forever as\
10:18\
a family. And the only way that can be\
is for all of us to be good members\
10:24\
of The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints,\
10:27\
and be sealed by the holy priesthood\
in the temple.\
10:31\
This is not the branch president’s\
Church; it’s the Church of Jesus Christ.\
10:36\
We will not allow any man\
10:38\
or any hurt or embarrassment or pride to\
keep us from being together forever.\
10:45\
Next Sunday, we'll go back to church.\
10:47\
We'll stay by ourselves until our\
daughter's sickness is known.\
10:51\
But we will go back.” They did go\
10:53\
back.\
10:55\
Their daughter recovered and\
the family was sealed in\
10:58\
the Laie Hawaii Temple\
when it was completed.\
11:02\
Today, well over 100 souls\
call their father,\
11:06\
grandfather, and great grandfather\
blessed because he kept his eyes\
11:11\
on eternity.\
11:14\
One last aspect of being valiant in the\
testimony of Jesus that\
11:18\
I will mention\
11:19\
is our individual pursuit\
of personal holiness.\
11:23\
Jesus is our essential Redeemer\
and He pleads,\
11:28\
“Repent, all ye ends of the earth,\
11:30\
and come unto me, and\
be baptized in my name,\
11:34\
that ye may be sanctified.\
by the reception of the Holy Ghost,\
11:38\
that ye may stand spotless before\
me at the last day.”\
11:43\
The prophet Mormon describes one group\
of saints who persevered in this manner\
11:48\
despite having “to wade through\
much affliction”:\
11:52\
“Nevertheless, they did\
fast and pray oft,\
11:57\
and did waxed stronger and stronger\
in their humility,\
12:01\
and firmer and firmer in\
the faith of Christ,\
12:04\
unto the filling their souls with\
joy and consolation, yea,\
12:09\
even to the purifying and the\
sanctification of their hearts,\
12:13\
which sanctification cometh,\
12:15\
because of their yielding\
their hearts unto God.”\
12:20\
It is this mighty change of heart,\
12:23\
yielding our hearts to God and being\
spiritually reborn through\
12:28\
the grace of the Savior, that we seek.\
12:31\
My invitation is to act now,\
12:33\
to secure your place as one who is\
valiant in the testimony of Jesus.\
12:40\
As repentance may be needed, “do not\
procrastinate the day of your\
12:45\
repentance”\
12:46\
lest “in an hour when you think not the\
12:48\
summer shall be past, and the harvest\
ended, and your souls not saved.”\
12:55\
Be zealous in keeping your\
covenants with God.\
12:57\
Do not be “offended [by] the\
strictness of the word.”\
13:02\
“Remember to retain the name [of Christ]\
written always in your hearts,\
13:07\
that ye may hear and know the voice\
by which ye shall be called,\
13:12\
and also, the name by which\
he shall call you.”\
13:16\
And finally, “settle\
this in your hearts,\
13:20\
that ye will do the things which [Jesus]\
shall teach, and command you.”\
13:26\
Our Father wants all His\
children who will to\
13:29\
enjoy eternal life with Him\
in His celestial kingdom.\
13:33\
Jesus suffered, died, and was\
resurrected to make that possible.\
13:38\
He “hath ascended into heaven, and hath\
sat down on the right hand of God,\
13:44\
to claim of the Father\
his rights of mercy\
13:47\
which he hath upon all\
the children of men.”\
13:51\
I pray that we may all be blessed\
with a burning testimony of\
13:54\
the Lord Jesus Christ, rejoice\
and be valiant in that\
13:58\
testimony\
13:59\
and enjoy the fruits of His grace\
in our lives continually.\
14:04\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
