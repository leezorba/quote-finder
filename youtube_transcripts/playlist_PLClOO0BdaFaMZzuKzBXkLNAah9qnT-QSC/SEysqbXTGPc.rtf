after I graduated from law school my\
0:03\
wife Marc and I chose to join a law firm\
0:06\
that specialized in trial law as I began\
0:09\
my onth job training I spent much of my\
0:12\
time preparing witnesses to testify a\
0:15\
trial I quickly learned that facts were\
0:18\
determined in a courtroom as Witnesses\
0:20\
under oath testified to the truthfulness\
0:23\
of what they had both seen and\
0:25\
heard as Witnesses testified their words\
0:28\
were both recorded and present\
0:30\
oberved the importance of credible\
0:32\
Witnesses was always at the Forefront of\
0:35\
my\
0:36\
preparation it didn't take long for me\
0:38\
to realize that the very same terms I\
0:40\
was using every day as a lawyer were\
0:42\
also the terms I used in my gospel\
0:45\
conversations witness and testimony are\
0:49\
terms that we use as we share our\
0:52\
knowledge and feelings about the\
0:54\
truthfulness of the Gospel of Jesus\
0:56\
Christ when I was sustained as a new\
0:58\
area 70\
1:00\
I opened the scriptures to learn my\
1:02\
duties and re read Doctrine and Covenant\
1:05\
section\
1:06\
10725 which states the 70 are also\
1:10\
called to be a special Witnesses unto\
1:13\
the Gentiles and in all the world as you\
1:16\
can imagine my eyes were drawn to the\
1:18\
term a special witness it became clear\
1:22\
to me that I had a responsibility to\
1:24\
Bear my witness to testify of the name\
1:27\
of Jesus Christ wherever I travel in the\
1:30\
world there are many examples in the\
1:33\
scriptures of those who are eyewitnesses\
1:35\
and who testified to what they both saw\
1:38\
and\
1:39\
heard as the ancient Prophet Mormon\
1:42\
begins his record he writes and now I\
1:45\
Mormon make a record of the things which\
1:47\
I have both seen and heard and call it\
1:50\
the Book of\
1:51\
Mormon the savior's Apostles Peter and\
1:54\
John healed a man in the name of Jesus\
1:56\
Christ of Nazareth when commanded not to\
1:59\
speak in the name of Jesus they\
2:02\
responded whether it be right in the\
2:04\
sight of God to hearken unto you more\
2:07\
than unto God judge ye for we cannot but\
2:10\
speak of the things which we have seen\
2:13\
and\
2:14\
heard another compelling testimony comes\
2:17\
from The Book of Mormon Saints who\
2:19\
witnessed the visit of the Savior Jesus\
2:22\
Christ listen to this description of\
2:24\
their\
2:25\
witness and after this manner do they\
2:28\
bear record the eye hath never seen\
2:31\
neither hath the ear heard before so\
2:34\
great and marvelous things as we both\
2:36\
saw and heard Jesus speak unto the\
2:39\
father brothers and sisters today I\
2:43\
declare my witness and make a record of\
2:46\
what I have both seen and heard during\
2:49\
my sacred ministry as a 70 of the Lord\
2:52\
Jesus\
2:53\
Christ in doing so I testify to you of a\
2:56\
loving heavenly father and his\
2:58\
benevolent son Jesus Christ who suffered\
3:02\
died and rose again to offer eternal\
3:05\
life to God's\
3:06\
children I testify of a marvelous work\
3:10\
and a wonder and that the Lord has set\
3:12\
his sand once again to restore his\
3:15\
gospel on the earth through his living\
3:17\
prophets and\
3:19\
apostles I testify that based upon upon\
3:22\
what I have both seen and heard there\
3:25\
has never been a better time to be a\
3:27\
member of the Church of Jesus Christ of\
3:29\
latterday Saints than\
3:31\
today I know this of my own knowledge\
3:34\
independent of any other source because\
3:37\
of what I have both seen and\
3:40\
heard during my senior year of high\
3:42\
school to graduate from Seminary I had\
3:44\
to identify all 15 temples of the\
3:48\
church a picture of each Temple was at\
3:51\
the front of our classroom and I had to\
3:53\
know where each one was\
3:55\
located now years later it would be an\
3:58\
enormous challenge with\
4:00\
335 operating or announced temples to\
4:04\
identify each one I have personally seen\
4:07\
many of these houses of the Lord and\
4:09\
testify that the Lord is offering His\
4:12\
blessings and ordinances to more and\
4:14\
more of his children across the\
4:16\
world my friends at family search have\
4:19\
taught me that they add over 1 million\
4:22\
new names to family search every\
4:25\
day if you didn't find your ancestor\
4:27\
yesterday I invite you to look again\
4:31\
tomorrow when it comes to Gathering\
4:33\
Israel on the other side of the veil\
4:36\
there has never been a better time to be\
4:38\
a member of the Church of Jesus Christ\
4:41\
of latterday saints than\
4:43\
today raising our children in twinfalls\
4:46\
Idaho our perspective of the worldwide\
4:49\
church was\
4:50\
limited when I was called to be a\
4:52\
general Authority Marcy and I were\
4:54\
assigned to serve in the Pacific area a\
4:57\
place we'd never been we pleased to find\
5:00\
stakes from the top of New Zealand to\
5:02\
the bottom with a temple that was\
5:04\
dedicated in 1958 it was one of those 15\
5:08\
I had to memorize in\
5:10\

5:13\

5:16\
continent we had assignments in Samoa\
5:19\

9:15\
Nephi beheld the power of the Lamb of\
9:17\
God that it descended upon the Saints of\
9:20\
the Church of the lamb and upon the\
9:21\
Covenant people of the Lord who were\
9:23\
