Dear young friends. Today I would\
like to speak directly to you—\
0:05\
the youth of the Church. It’s been\
0:08\
a year since our Young Women General\
Presidency was called.\
0:12\
And how much has happened\
in this past year!\
0:16\
We have met many of you and have studied\
the teachings of Christ\
0:20\
together. We have sung songs,\
made new friends,\
0:24\
and served with you in our communities.\
0:27\
We have been strengthened by listening\
to your testimonies at youth\
0:31\
conferences and world events,\
0:34\
and we have worshiped together\
in the house of the Lord.\
0:38\
Each time we have shared a message\
from our Lord Jesus Christ.\
0:43\
Tonight will not be different.\
0:45\
I have a message for you, the youth\
of the Church of Jesus Christ.\
0:50\
Have you ever wondered how you can be\
faithful to God while living in\
0:55\
a world of sin? Where do you get\
the strength to go forward\
1:00\
and continue doing good? How\
do you experience true joy?\
1:05\
I think the experience of David\
and Goliath can help.\
1:10\
In the Old Testament, the army of\
the Philistines was battling\
1:15\
the Israelites, and every morning\
and every evening,\
1:19\
a giant Philistine named Goliath\
challenged any Israelite to fight him.\
1:26\
Among the Israelite people lived David,\
a young shepherd,\
1:32\
much smaller than Goliath, but with\
a giant faith in Jesus Christ.\
1:37\
David volunteered to fight.\
1:40\
Even the king tried to dissuade him,\
1:43\
but David chose to put his\
trust in Jesus Christ.\
1:48\
Previously, David had fought\
a lion and also a bear.\
1:52\
From his experience, he knew\
that God had protected him\
1:57\
and made him victorious. To David,\
2:01\
the cause of God was the\
most important cause.\
2:06\
So, full of faith in a God who\
would not abandon him,\
2:10\
he gathered five smooth stones, took up\
his sling, and went to face the giant.\
2:18\
The scriptures tell us that the first\
stone David threw hit Goliath’s forehead\
2:26\
ending his life. While David used\
only one stone to kill Goliath,\
2:33\
he was prepared with five—with five!\
2:37\
This made me think about how I can\
prepare myself to face the world.\
2:44\
What if each of David’s stones\
represented a strength\
2:49\
we need to be triumphant in our lives.\
What could those five stones be?\
2:56\
I thought of these possibilities:\
The stone of my love for God;\
3:02\
the stone of my faith in our Savior,\
Jesus Christ;\
3:07\
the stone of the knowledge\
of my true identity;\
3:11\
the stone of my daily repentance; and\
the stone of my access to God’s power.\
3:18\
Let's talk about how we are blessed\
by these strengths.\
3:23\
First, the stone of my love for God.\
3:27\
Loving God is the first\
great commandment.\
3:30\
The For the Strength of Youth guide\
teaches us, “God loves you.\
3:36\
He is your Father. His perfect love\
can inspire you to love Him.\
3:42\
When your love for Heavenly Father is\
3:44\
the most important influence in your\
life, many decisions become easier.”\
3:51\
Our love for God and our close\
relationship with Him give us\
3:56\
the strength we need to\
transform our hearts\
4:00\
and more easily overcome our challenges.\
4:04\
Second, the stone of my faith\
in our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
4:09\
When Jesus Christ came to earth,\
4:11\
He suffered for our sins and He took\
upon Himself our sorrows, our pains,\
4:19\
our weaknesses, and our physical\
and mental illnesses.\
4:24\
That’s why He knows how to help us.\
4:28\
Having faith in Jesus Christ means to\
fully trust His wisdom, His timing,\
4:35\
His love, and His power\
to atone for our sins.\
4:39\
The stone of faith in Jesus Christ will\
defeat any “giant” in our lives.\
4:45\
We can overcome this fallen world\
because He overcame it first.\
4:51\
Number three, the stone of the knowledge\
of my true identity.\
4:57\
Our beloved prophet, President\
Russell M. Nelson,\
5:00\
taught us that our most important\
identities are as children of God,\
5:06\
children of the covenant, and\
disciples of Jesus Christ.\
5:10\
Everything changes when I\
know who I really am.\
5:15\
When I doubt my abilities, I often\
repeat to myself in my mind or out loud,\
5:22\
“I am a daughter of God, I\
am a daughter of God”\
5:26\
as many times as I need until I again\
feel confident to keep going.\
5:34\
Fourth, the stone of my daily\
repentance. In For the Strength of Youth\
5:41\
we read,\
“Repentance isn’t punishment for sin;\
5:45\
it is the way the Savior\
frees us from sin.\
5:49\
To repent means to change—to turn\
away from sin and toward God.\
5:55\
It means to improve and\
receive forgiveness.\
5:59\
This kind of change is not a one time\
event; it’s an ongoing process.”\
6:07\
Nothing is more liberating than\
feeling God's forgiveness\
6:12\
and knowing that we are clean\
and reconciled with Him.\
6:18\
Forgiveness is possible for everyone.\
6:23\
The fifth stone is the stone of\
my access to God's power.\
6:28\
The covenants we make with God,\
6:31\
such as those we make in the\
ordinance of baptism,\
6:34\
give us access to the\
power of godliness.\
6:38\
God's power is a real power that helps\
us face challenges, make good decisions,\
6:46\
and increase our capacity to endure\
difficult situations.\
6:51\
It's a power with which we can grow in\
the specific abilities that we need.\
6:57\
The For the Strength of\
Youth guide explains,\
7:02\
“Covenants connect you to Heavenly\
Father and the Savior.\
7:06\
They increase God’s power in your life.”\
Let’s talk about that connection.\
7:13\
Remember when Christ taught the\
difference between a house built\
7:17\
on rock and one on sand?\
Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf explained,\
7:23\
“A house doesn’t survive in a storm\
because the house is strong.\
7:28\
It also doesn't survive just\
because the rock is strong.\
7:33\
The house survives the storm\
7:36\
because it is firmly attached\
to that strong rock.\
7:41\
It’s the strength of the connection\
to the rock that matters.”\
7:47\
Our personal connection to Jesus\
Christ will give us the courage\
7:52\
and confidence to move forward amid\
people who do not respect our beliefs\
7:58\
or who bully us. Christ invites us to\
keep Him in our thoughts constantly.\
8:05\
He tells us, “Look unto\
me in every thought.”\
8:10\
Thinking about the Savior\
gives us clarity of mind\
8:17\
to make decisions, to act without fear,\
8:21\
and to say no to what is contrary\
to God's teachings.\
8:26\
When my day is difficult and I feel\
like I can't take any more,\
8:31\
thinking about Christ brings\
me peace and gives me hope.\
8:36\
How can we draw upon this\
power of Jesus Christ?\
8:41\
Obeying our covenants and increasing\
our faith in Jesus Christ are key.\
8:47\
I actually wish David had\
had one more stone.\
8:52\
That would be the stone of my testimony.\
8:56\
Our testimony is built by personal\
spiritual experiences in which we\
9:01\
recognize the divine influence\
in our lives.\
9:05\
No one can take that knowledge from us.\
9:10\
Knowing what we know from having lived\
our spiritual experiences is priceless.\
9:16\
Being true to that knowledge gives\
us freedom. It gives us joy.\
9:22\
If we love the truth, we will seek it.\
9:25\
And once we find it, we will defend it.\
9:30\
Just as I chose stone number six, I\
invite you to meet with your class,\
9:36\
quorum, or family and think about what\
others strengths we need to acquire\
9:42\
to remain faithful to God and therefore\
overcome the world.\
9:48\
Dear friends, Christ is eager\
to accompany us on\
9:53\
the journey of our lives.\
9:55\
I promise you, as you hold\
onto the iron rod,\
10:00\
you will walk hand in hand\
with Jesus Christ.\
10:05\
He will be guiding you, and He will\
be teaching you. By His hand,\
10:10\
you will be able to bring down every\
Goliath that appears in your life.\
10:17\
I testify that there is joy in praying\
every day, in reading the Book of Mormon\
10:24\
every day, in partaking of the\
sacrament every Sunday,\
10:28\
and in going to seminary—even\
in the early morning.\
10:33\
There is joy in doing good.\
10:35\
There is joy in being faithful\
to the God of the universe,\
10:40\
the Savior of the world,\
the King of Kings.\
10:44\
There is joy in being a disciple of\
Jesus Christ. God is our Father.\
10:51\
He knows your heart’s desires and your\
possibilities, and He trusts you.\
10:59\
Dear youth, Jesus Christ will help you\
to be faithful to the end. Of this truth\
11:06\
I bear my testimony in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
