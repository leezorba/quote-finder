Recently while driving in a city\
0:03\
unknown to us, I inadvertently\
took a wrong turn,\
0:06\
which led my wife and me\
onto an express highway\
0:11\
for endless miles without being\
able to turn around again.\
0:15\
We had received a kind invitation\
to a friend's home,\
0:19\
and worried that we would now arrive\
much later than we were expected to.\
0:25\
While on this highway and desperately\
looking for a way out again,\
0:29\
I blamed myself for not paying better\
attention to the navigation system.\
0:34\
This experience caused me to think\
about how, in our lives,\
0:39\
we sometimes make wrong decisions,\
0:42\
and how we must live with the\
consequences humbly and patiently,\
0:47\
until we are able to change our course\
again. Life is all about making choices.\
0:55\
Our Father in Heaven gave us\
the divine gift of agency,\
0:59\
precisely so that we could learn from\
our choices, from the right ones,\
1:05\
and also from the wrong ones.\
1:07\
We correct our wrong choices when we\
repent. This is where growth happens.\
1:15\
Heavenly Father’s plan for all of us\
is about learning, developing,\
1:20\
and progressing toward eternal life.\
1:25\
Ever since my wife and I were taught\
by the missionaries and joined\
1:29\
the Church many years ago,\
1:31\
I have always been impressed by\
1:33\
the profound teachings that Lehi\
gave to his son Jacob in\
1:38\
the Book of Mormon. He taught him\
that “the Lord gave unto man\
1:44\
that he should act for himself”\
1:47\
and that “it must needs be that there\
is an opposition in all things.”\
1:53\
To be able to exercise our agency,\
1:56\
we need to have opposing\
options to consider.\
2:01\
And in doing so, the Book of Mormon\
also reminds us that we have been\
2:06\
“instructed sufficiently” and that\
“the Spirit\
2:09\
of Christ” has been given to every\
one of us to “know good from evil.”\
2:17\
In life, we constantly confront many\
important choices. For example,\
2:24\
choosing whether or not we will\
follow God’s commandments;\
2:30\
choosing to have faith and recognize\
when miracles happen\
2:33\
or skeptically wait for something\
to happen before\
2:38\
choosing to believe only then;\
2:42\
choosing to develop trust in God\
2:45\
or fearfully anticipate another\
challenge the next day.\
2:51\
As when I took the wrong\
turn on that highway,\
2:55\
suffering from the consequences of our\
own poor decisions can often be\
3:01\
especially painful because we only\
have ourselves to blame.\
3:05\
Nevertheless, we can always choose\
to receive comfort through\
3:10\
the divine process of repentance,\
3:13\
make wrong things right again,\
and in doing so,\
3:16\
learn some life-changing lessons.\
3:20\
Sometimes we can also experience\
opposition\
3:23\
and trials from things outside of our\
control, such as, for example,\
3:28\
moments of health and\
periods of sickness,\
3:32\
times of peace and times of war,\
3:36\
hours of day and of night and seasons\
of summer and of winter,\
3:41\
times of labor followed\
by times of rest.\
3:46\
Even though we usually cannot choose\
between these kinds of situations\
3:50\
because they just happen, we are still\
free to choose how to react to them.\
3:57\
We can do so with the positive or\
with a pessimistic attitude.\
4:02\
We can seek to learn from\
the experience and ask\
4:06\
for our Lord’s help and support,\
4:08\
or we can think that we are\
on our own in this trial\
4:13\
and that we must suffer it alone.\
4:16\
We can adjust our sails\
to the new reality,\
4:20\
or we can decide not to change anything.\
In the darkness of night\
4:25\
we can turn on our lights.\
In the cold of winter,\
4:29\
we should choose to wear warm clothes.\
4:32\
In seasons of sickness, we can seek\
medical and spiritual help.\
4:37\
We choose how to react to these\
circumstances. “Adjust,” “learn,”\
4:44\
“seek,” “choose” are all action verbs.\
4:48\
Remember that we are agents\
and not objects.\
4:51\
Let us never forget that Jesus promised\
to take upon Him “the pains\
4:57\
and sicknesses of His people ...\
4:59\
that He may ... succor” or help\
us as we turn to Him.\
5:05\
We can choose to build our foundation\
on the rock that is Jesus Christ,\
5:10\
so that when the whirlwind comes,\
“it shall have no power over us.”\
5:16\
He has promised that “whosoever will\
come [to Him], him will [H]e receive;\
5:22\
and blessed are those\
who come unto [Him].”\
5:27\
Now there is one additional principle\
that is especially important.\
5:33\
Lehi said that there “must needs\
be an opposition in all things.”\
5:39\
This means that opposites don't\
exist apart from each other.\
5:43\
They can even complement each other.\
5:47\
We would not be able to identify joy\
unless we had also experienced sorrow\
5:53\
at some point. Feeling hungry at times\
helps us to be especially grateful\
5:58\
when we do have enough to eat again.\
6:01\
We would not be able to identify truth\
unless we had also seen lies here\
6:07\
and there. These opposites are all like\
the two sides of one same coin.\
6:14\
Both sides are always present.\
6:17\
Charles Dickens provided an example of\
this idea when he wrote that “It was\
6:21\
the best of times, it was\
the worst of times.” Let\
6:25\
me give an example from our own life.\
Getting married, forming a family,\
6:30\
and having children brought to us\
6:31\
the greatest moments of joy we have\
ever experienced in our lives,\
6:35\
but also the most profound\
moments of pain, anguish,\
6:39\
and grief when something happened\
to any one of us.\
6:43\
Infinite joy and bliss with our children\
were sometimes also followed\
6:48\
by recurring periods of sicknesses,\
hospitalizations,\
6:51\
and sleepless nights filled\
with distress,\
6:55\
as well as finding relief in prayers\
and priesthood blessings.\
7:00\
These contrasting experiences taught us\
that we are never alone in moments\
7:05\
of suffering, and they also\
showed us how much we can carry with\
7:11\
the Lord's succor and help.\
7:13\
These experiences helped to\
shape us in wonderful ways\
7:17\
and it has all been totally worthwhile.\
Is this not what we came here for?\
7:25\
In the scriptures we also find\
some interesting examples.\
7:28\
Lehi taught his son Jacob that the\
afflictions he suffered in\
7:32\
the wilderness helped him\
know the greatness of God,\
7:36\
and that “[God] shall consecrate\
[his] afflictions to [his] gain.”\
7:41\
During Joseph Smith’s cruel\
incarceration in Liberty Jail,\
7:46\
the Lord told him that “all these things\
shall give [him] experience,\
7:50\
and shall be for [his] good.”\
7:53\
Finally, Jesus Christ's infinite\
sacrifice was certainly\
7:58\
the greatest example of pain\
and suffering ever seen.\
8:02\
But it also brought about\
8:04\
the wonderful blessings of His Atonement\
to all of God's children.\
8:09\
Where there is sunshine, shadows\
must be there too.\
8:14\
Floods can bring destruction, but\
they usually bring life as well.\
8:20\
Tears of grief often turn into tears\
of relief and happiness.\
8:25\
Feelings of sadness when loved ones\
depart are later compensated with\
8:29\
the joy of meeting again.\
8:31\
In periods of war and destruction,\
8:34\
many little acts of kindness and\
love are also happening\
8:38\
for those with “eyes to see and\
ears to hear.”\
8:43\
Our world today is often characterized\
by fear and anxiety—\
8:47\
fear of what the future\
might bring for us.\
8:51\
But Jesus has taught us to trust and to\
“look unto [Him] in every thought;\
8:57\
doubt not, fear not.” Let\
us constantly make\
9:03\
a very conscious effort to see both\
sides of every coin allotted to us in\
9:09\
our lives. Even though both sides might\
sometimes not be immediately visible\
9:14\
to us, we can know and trust\
that they are always there.\
9:19\
We can rest assured that our\
difficulties, sorrows, afflictions,\
9:23\
and plans do not define us.\
9:25\
Rather, it is how we go about\
them that will help us grow,\
9:30\
grow and draw closer to God.\
9:33\
It is our attitudes and choices that\
define us much better than our\
9:37\
challenges. When in health, cherish and\
be grateful for it every moment.\
9:43\
When in sickness, seek to\
patiently learn from it\
9:46\
and know that this can change again\
according to God's will.\
9:50\
When in sorrow, trust that happiness\
is around the corner.\
9:54\
We often just cannot see it yet.\
9:57\
Consciously shift your focus and\
elevate your thoughts to\
10:01\
the positive aspects of challenges,\
10:04\
because they are always undoubtedly\
there too. Never forget to be grateful.\
10:11\
Choose to believe. Choose to\
have faith in Jesus Christ.\
10:15\
Choose to always trust God.\
Choose to think celestial,\
10:20\
as President Nelson recently taught us.\
10:23\
Let us always be mindful of our Heavenly\
Father's wonderful plan\
10:28\
for us. He loves us and sent His beloved\
Son to help in our trials,\
10:33\
and to open for us the door\
to return to Him.\
10:37\
Jesus Christ lives and stands\
there at every moment,\
10:41\
waiting for us to choose to call upon\
Him to provide succor, strength,\
10:47\
and salvation. Of these things\
I testify in the name of\
10:52\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
