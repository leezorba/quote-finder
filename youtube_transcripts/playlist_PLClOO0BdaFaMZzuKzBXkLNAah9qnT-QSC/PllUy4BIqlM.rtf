Dear brothers and sisters,\
0:02\
we are so grateful for your\
efforts in reading\
0:04\
the scriptures with Come,\
Follow Me. Thank you.\
0:08\
Thank you for all that you are doing.\
0:11\
Your daily connection with God and His\
word has profound consequences.\
0:16\
“Ye are laying the foundation\
of a great work,\
0:18\
and out of small things proceedeth\
that which is great.”\
0:24\
Reading the Savior's teachings in\
0:25\
the scriptures helps us transform our\
homes into sanctuaries of faith\
0:30\
and centers of gospel learning.\
It invites the Spirit\
0:34\
into our homes. The Holy Ghost\
fills our souls with joy\
0:39\
and converts us into lifelong\
disciples of Jesus Christ.\
0:44\
Over these last several years, while\
reading the books of holy scripture,\
0:48\
we have observed the panorama of God’s\
teachings to His children in all\
0:52\
the major gospel dispensations.\
0:55\
In every dispensation, we have\
seen a familiar pattern.\
0:59\
God restores or reveals the gospel of\
Jesus Christ through His prophets,\
1:04\
the people follow the prophets\
and are greatly blessed.\
1:07\
However, over time, some people stop\
heeding the words of the prophets\
1:11\
and distance themselves from\
the Lord and His gospel.\
1:15\
This is what we call apostasy.\
1:17\
The gospel was first revealed to Adam,\
1:20\
but some of the children of Adam\
and Eve turned away from\
1:23\
the Lord in apostasy. We see\
a pattern of restoration\
1:28\
and apostasy repeated in the\
dispensations of Enoch, Noah,\
1:34\
Abraham, Moses, and others.\
1:37\
Now, today we live in the dispensation\
of the fulness of times.\
1:41\
This is the only dispensation that\
will not end in an apostasy.\
1:45\
It is this dispensation that will usher\
in the Second Coming of the Savior,\
1:50\
Jesus Christ, and His millennial reign.\
1:53\
So what's different about\
this dispensation?\
1:57\
What has the Lord provided us today,\
especially for our time,\
2:02\
that will help us draw near to the\
Savior and never leave Him?\
2:07\
One answer that comes to my\
mind is the scriptures,\
2:11\
and particularly the Book of Mormon:\
Another Testament of Jesus Christ.\
2:15\
While God has promised there will never\
be another general apostasy,\
2:20\
we need to be mindful and careful to\
avoid a personal apostasy, remembering,\
2:24\
as President Russell M.\
Nelson has taught,\
2:27\
“We are each responsible for our\
individual spiritual growth.”\
2:32\
Studying the Book of Mormon\
as we are doing this year,\
2:35\
always brings us closer to the Savior\
and helps us stay close to Him.\
2:41\
We call it study, and that's good\
because it implies effort,\
2:45\
but we don't always need\
to learn some new fact.\
2:48\
Sometimes reading the Book of Mormon is\
just about feeling connected to God\
2:53\
today—nourishing the soul,\
2:55\
being strengthened spiritually before\
heading out to face the world,\
2:59\
or finding healing after a rough\
day out in the world.\
3:04\
We study the scriptures so the\
Holy Ghost, the great teacher,\
3:08\
can deepen our conversion to Heavenly\
Father and Jesus Christ and help us\
3:13\
become more like Them. With\
these thoughts in mind,\
3:17\
we could consider what has\
3:19\
the Holy Ghost taught us this week\
during our study of the Book of Mormon?\
3:23\
And how does this bring us\
closer to the Savior?\
3:27\
These are good questions for our\
scripture study at home.\
3:30\
They are also excellent questions to\
start a Sunday class at church.\
3:35\
We improve our teaching at church\
3:37\
on Sunday by improving our learning\
at home during the week.\
3:43\
Thus, in our Sunday classes,\
3:45\
“he that preacheth and he that receiveth\
understand one another,\
3:50\
and both are edified and\
rejoice together.”\
3:53\
Here are a few verses the Spirit has\
impressed upon my mind from this week’s\
3:58\
Book of Mormon study. Nephi instructed\
Jacob to “preserve these plates\
4:04\
and hand them down ... from generation\
to generation. And if\
4:07\
there were preaching which was sacred,\
or revelation ... or prophesying,”\
4:12\
Jacob should “engraven ... them upon\
these plates ... for the sake of [their]\
4:17\
people.” Jacob later testified, “We\
searched the [scriptures], ...\
4:20\
and having all these witnesses,\
4:22\
we obtain a hope and our faith\
becometh unshaken.”\
4:26\
Now, these verses caused me to remember\
what Nephi had said previously about\
4:31\
the brass plates: “We had obtained\
the records ... and searched them\
4:36\
and found that they were\
... of great worth unto us,\
4:38\
insomuch that we could preserve\
the commandments of\
4:41\
the Lord unto our children.”\
4:43\
“Wherefore it was wisdom in the Lord\
that we should carry them with us,\
4:48\
as we journeyed in the wilderness\
towards the land of promise.”\
4:53\
Now if it was wisdom for Lehi and his\
family to have the scriptures,\
4:57\
it is just as wise for us today.\
5:01\
The great worth and spiritual power of\
5:03\
the scriptures continues undimmed\
in our lives today.\
5:07\
There has never been a people in\
history with the access to\
5:11\
the Book of Mormon and other scriptures\
that we enjoy today.\
5:15\
Yes, Lehi and his family were blessed\
to carry the brass plates with them,\
5:20\
but they didn't have a\
copy for every tent.\
5:23\
The most important copy of the Book\
of Mormon is our personal copy.\
5:28\
It’s the copy that we read. In Lehi’s\
vision of the tree of life,\
5:33\
Lehi taught us the importance\
of personal experience with\
5:37\
the love of God. After he\
partook of the fruit,\
5:41\
Lehi saw his wife, Sariah, and his sons\
Nephi and Sam a little way off.\
5:46\
“They stood as if they knew not\
whither they should go. ...\
5:51\
I beckoned unto them,” Lehi said,\
5:53\
“and I also did say unto them\
with a loud voice\
5:56\
that they should come unto me,\
5:58\
and partake of the fruit which was\
desirable above all other fruit.\
6:03\
And ... they did come unto me,\
and partake of the fruit.”\
6:08\
I love Lehi's example of\
intentional parenting.\
6:13\
Sariah, Nephi, and Sam were\
living good, righteous lives.\
6:18\
But the Lord had something better,\
something sweeter for them.\
6:22\
They didn't know where to\
find it, but Lehi did.\
6:25\
So he called to them with a loud voice\
to come to the tree of life\
6:30\
and partake of the fruit for themselves.\
His direction was clear.\
6:34\
There could be no misunderstanding.\
6:40\
I am the product of a similar kind\
of intentional parenting.\
6:45\
When I was a young boy, maybe 11 or 12\
years old, my mother asked me, “Mark,\
6:51\
do you know for yourself by the Holy\
Ghost that the gospel is true?”\
6:57\
Her question surprised me.\
6:59\
I had always tried to be a good boy\
and I thought that was enough.\
7:03\
But my mother, like Lehi, knew that\
something more was needed.\
7:07\
I needed to act and know for myself.\
7:12\
I replied that I had not yet\
had that experience,\
7:16\
and she didn't seem surprised\
at all by my answer.\
7:20\
She then said something\
I have never forgotten.\
7:24\
I remember her words to this day.\
7:27\
“Heavenly Father wants you\
to know for yourself,\
7:31\
but you must put in the effort.\
7:33\
You need to read the Book of Mormon and\
pray to know by the Holy Ghost.\
7:37\
Heavenly Father will answer\
your prayers.”\
7:42\
Well, I had never read the\
Book of Mormon before.\
7:44\
I didn't think I was old enough to do\
that, but my mother knew better.\
7:49\
Her question ignited in me a\
desire to know for myself.\
7:54\
So each night in the bedroom I shared\
with two of my brothers,\
7:58\
I turned on the light above my\
bed and read a chapter in\
8:01\
the Book of Mormon. Then,\
turning off the light,\
8:04\
I slipped out of my bed onto\
my knees and prayed.\
8:08\
I prayed more sincerely and with greater\
desire than I ever had before.\
8:15\
I asked Heavenly Father to please let\
me know of the truthfulness of\
8:19\
the Book of Mormon. From the time I\
started reading the Book of Mormon,\
8:24\
I felt that Heavenly Father\
was aware of my efforts\
8:28\
and felt that it mattered to Him.\
8:31\
As I read and prayed, comfortable,\
peaceful feelings rested upon me.\
8:36\
Chapter by chapter, the light of faith\
was growing brighter inside my soul.\
8:41\
In time, I realized that\
these confirmations,\
8:44\
these feelings, were confirmations\
of truth from the Holy Ghost.\
8:49\
I came to know for myself that\
the Book of Mormon is true,\
8:53\
and that Jesus Christ is the\
Savior of the world.\
8:56\
How grateful I am for my mother's\
inspired invitation.\
9:01\
This experience, reading the\
Book of Mormon as a boy,\
9:04\
started a pattern of scripture study\
that continues to bless me to this day.\
9:08\
I still read the Book of Mormon\
and kneel in prayer,\
9:11\
and the Holy Ghost confirms its\
truths over and over again.\
9:16\
Nephi said it right. It was wisdom\
in the Lord that we should carry\
9:20\
the scriptures with us\
throughout our lives.\
9:22\
The Book of Mormon is the keystone that\
makes this dispensation different\
9:27\
from all previous dispensations.\
9:30\
As we study the Book of Mormon and\
follow the living prophet,\
9:33\
there will be no personal\
apostasy in our lives.\
9:38\
The invitation to come to the tree\
of life by holding fast to\
9:42\
the word of God is not just an\
invitation from Lehi to his family,\
9:47\
and it is not just an invitation from my\
mother for me to read and pray about\
9:52\
the Book of Mormon. It is also an\
invitation from our Prophet,\
9:56\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
to each of one of us.\
10:00\
“I promise,” he said, “that as\
you prayerfully study\
10:04\
the Book of Mormon every day, you will\
make better decisions—every day.\
10:08\
I promise that as you ponder\
what you study,\
10:10\
the windows of heaven will open\
10:12\
and you will receive answers to your\
own questions and direction\
10:16\
for your own life.” It is\
my prayer that reading\
10:19\
the Book of Mormon this year will be a\
joy and a blessing for each of us,\
10:23\
and will draw us ever nearer to the\
Savior. Heavenly Father lives.\
10:28\
Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer.\
10:31\
The Book of Mormon contains His\
words and conveys His love.\
10:36\
President Russell M Nelson is\
the Lord's living prophet on\
10:40\
the earth today. I know these\
things to be true because of\
10:46\
the confirming witness\
of the Holy Ghost,\
10:48\
which witness I first received while\
reading the Book of Mormon as a boy.\
10:54\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
