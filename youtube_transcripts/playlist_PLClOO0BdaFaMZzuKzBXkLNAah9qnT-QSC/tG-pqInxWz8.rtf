We love you, Elder Kearon. May I borrow\
that accent for 10 minutes?\
0:11\
In the New Testament, we learn of blind\
Bartimaeus who cried out to Jesus,\
0:16\
desiring a miracle. “Jesus said\
unto him, Go thy way;\
0:21\
thy faith hath made thee whole. And\
immediately he received his sight.”\
0:28\
On another occasion, a man in Bethsaida\
longed for healing.\
0:32\
In contrast, this miracle\
did not come instantly.\
0:36\
Rather, Jesus blessed him twice\
before he “was restored.”\
0:42\
In a third example, the\
Apostle Paul “besought\
0:45\
the Lord thrice” in his affliction,\
0:48\
and yet, to our knowledge, his earnest\
supplication was not granted.\
0:52\
Three different people. Three\
unique experiences.\
0:58\
Thus, a question: Why do some receive\
their yearned-for miracles quickly,\
1:03\
while others patiently endure,\
waiting upon the Lord?\
1:08\
We may not know the “why,” yet\
gratefully, we know He who “loveth us”\
1:13\
“and [doeth] all things for [our]\
welfare and happiness.”\
1:18\
God, who sees the end\
from the beginning,\
1:21\
reassures “thine adversity and thine\
affliction shall be but a small moment,”\
1:27\
and they shall be “consecrate[d] ...\
for thy gain.”\
1:31\
Helping us find further\
meaning in our trials,\
1:34\
Elder Orson F. Whitney taught,\
“No pain that we suffer,\
1:38\
no trial that we experience is wasted.\
It ministers to our education. ... All\
1:44\
that we [patiently] endure ... builds\
up our characters, purifies our hearts,\
1:49\
expands our souls, and makes us\
more tender and charitable. ...\
1:53\
It is through sorrow and suffering, toil\
and tribulation, that we gain\
1:58\
the education that we\
come here to acquire\
2:00\
and which will make us more like our\
[heavenly parents].” Close quote.\
2:05\
Understanding that “the power of Christ\
[would] rest upon [him]” in his\
2:10\
afflictions, the Apostle Paul said\
humbly, “For when I am weak, then am I\
2:17\
strong.” Life’s trials “prove us.” Even\
the Savior “learned obedience by”\
2:22\
and was made perfect\
“through sufferings.”\
2:25\
And one day He will compassionately\
declare, “Behold, I have refined thee,\
2:32\
I have chosen thee in the\
furnace of affliction.”\
2:36\
Coming to trust in God’s\
divine purposes\
2:39\
breathes hope into weary souls\
2:41\
and kindles determination in seasons\
of anguish and heartache.\
2:48\
Years ago, President Russell M. Nelson\
shared this valuable insight:\
2:53\
“As we look at all things with\
eternal perspective,\
2:56\
it will significantly lighten our load.”\
2:59\
My wife, Jill, and I recently\
witnessed this truth in\
3:04\
the faithful lives of Holly and Rick\
Porter, whose 12-year-old son, Trey,\
3:11\
passed away in a tragic fire.\
3:14\
With hands and feet severely burned in a\
heroic attempt to save her dear son,\
3:19\
Holly later testified in ward\
sacrament meeting of the great peace\
3:24\
and joy the Lord had poured out upon\
her family in their anguish,\
3:29\
using words such as “miraculous,”\
“incredible,” and “amazing.”\
3:36\
This precious mother’s unbearable grief\
was replaced by surpassing peace with\
3:41\
this thought: “My hands are\
not the hands that save.\
3:47\
Those hands belong to the Savior!\
3:51\
Instead of looking at my scars as a\
reminder of what I was not able to do,\
3:56\
I remember the scars my Savior bears.”\
4:00\
Holly’s witness fulfills\
our Prophet’s promise:\
4:04\
“As you think celestial, you will view\
trials and opposition in a new light.”\
4:11\
Elder D. Todd Christofferson stated,\
4:13\
“I believe that the challenge\
of overcoming\
4:16\
and growing from adversity\
appealed to us\
4:19\
when God presented His plan of\
redemption in the premortal world.\
4:23\
We should approach that challenge now,\
4:26\
knowing that our Heavenly\
Father will sustain us.\
4:29\
But it is crucial that we\
turn to Him. Without God,\
4:36\
the dark experiences of suffering and\
adversity tend to despondency,\
4:40\
despair, and even bitterness.”\
4:43\
To avoid the darkness of discontent and\
instead find greater peace, hope,\
4:49\
and even joy during life’s\
difficult challenges,\
4:52\
I share three divine principles\
as invitations. One—\
4:59\
stronger faith comes by putting\
Jesus Christ first.\
5:04\
“Look unto me in every thought,”\
He declares. “Doubt not,\
5:08\
fear not.” President Nelson teaches,\
5:12\
“[Our] eternal life is dependent upon\
[our] faith in [Christ] and in His\
5:17\
Atonement.” “As I have wrestled with\
the intense pain caused by my recent\
5:22\
injury, I have felt even deeper\
appreciation for Jesus Christ and\
5:27\
the incomprehensible gift\
of the Atonement.\
5:30\
Think of it! The Savior suffered\
’pains and afflictions\
5:35\
and temptations of every kind’ so that\
He can comfort us, heal us,\
5:42\
[and] rescue us in times of need.”\
5:44\
He continued, “My injury has caused\
me to reflect again and again on\
5:50\
‘the greatness of\
the Holy One of Israel.’\
5:52\
During my healing, the Lord has\
manifested His divine power in peaceful\
5:58\
and unmistakable ways.” “In the world\
ye shall have tribulation:\
6:05\
but be of good cheer,” our Savior\
encourages, “I have overcome the world.”\
6:12\
Two. Brighter hope comes by envisioning\
our eternal destiny.\
6:18\
In speaking of the power\
inherent in keeping\
6:20\
“a vision of our Father’s\
incredible promised blessings\
6:23\
... before our eyes every day,”\
Sister Linda Reeves testified,\
6:29\
“I do not know why we have the\
many trials that we have,\
6:33\
but it is my personal feeling that the\
reward is so great, ... so joyful\
6:37\
and beyond our understanding that in\
that day of reward, we may feel to say\
6:42\
to our merciful, loving Father, ‘Was\
that all that was required?’ ...\
6:49\
What will it matter ... what\
we have suffered here\
6:52\
if, in the end, those trials ... qualify\
us for eternal life ... in\
6:57\
the kingdom of God?” Close quote.\
President Nelson shared this insight:\
7:04\
“Consider the Lord’s response to\
Joseph Smith when he pleaded\
7:08\
for relief in Liberty Jail.\
7:10\
The Lord taught the Prophet that his\
inhumane treatment would give him\
7:14\
experience and be for his good. ‘If thou\
endure it well,’ the Lord promised,\
7:20\
‘God shall exalt thee on high.’\
7:23\
The Lord was teaching Joseph to think\
celestial and to envision\
7:27\
an eternal reward rather than focus\
on the excruciating difficulties of\
7:33\
the day.” Joseph’s change in perspective\
brought deepening sanctification,\
7:39\
as reflected in this letter to a friend:\
7:42\
“After having been enclosed in the walls\
of a prison for five months,\
7:47\
it seems to me that my heart will always\
be more tender after this than\
7:51\
it was than ever before. I think I never\
could have felt as I do now,\
7:57\
if I had not suffered the wrongs\
that I have suffered.”\
8:03\
Three: Greater power comes by focusing\
8:06\
on joy. During eternity’s most\
crucial agonizing hours,\
8:12\
our Savior did not shrink, but partook\
of the bitter cup. How did He do it?\
8:19\
We learn, “for the joy that\
was set before him\
8:23\
[Christ] endured the cross,”\
8:25\
His will being swallowed up\
in the will of the Father.\
8:29\
This phrase “swallowed\
up” deeply moves me.\
8:33\
My interest was heightened when\
I learned that in Spanish,\
8:36\
swallowed up is translated as “consumed”\
—“consumidas”; in German as “devoured;”\
8:43\
and in Chinese as “engulfed.”\
8:45\
Thus, when life's challenges are\
most painful and overwhelming,\
8:50\
I remember the Lord’s promise that we\
“should suffer no manner of afflictions,\
8:54\
save it [be] swallowed up, [consumed,\
devoured,\
8:59\
and engulfed] in the joy of Christ.”\
9:03\
I see in so many of you this joy which\
“defies mortal comprehension,”\
9:09\
even though your bitter cups\
have not yet been removed.\
9:16\
Thank you for keeping your covenants\
and “standing as witnesses for God.”\
9:22\
Thank you for reaching\
out to bless us all,\
9:26\
while “in [your] quiet heart is hidden\
sorrow that the eye can’t see.”\
9:32\
For, “when [you] bring the Savior’s\
relief to others,\
9:36\
[you will] find it for [yourselves],”\
taught President Camille Johnson.\
9:40\
Now return with me to the\
sacrament meeting,\
9:43\
where we witnessed the miracle of Holly\
Porter’s family being succored by\
9:49\
the Lord. On the stand\
while pondering what\
9:52\
I might say to offer comfort to this\
remarkable family and their friends,\
9:56\
this thought came: “Use\
the Savior’s words.”\
10:01\
So I close today as I\
did on that Sabbath,\
10:06\
with His words “which healeth\
the wounded soul.”\
10:12\
“Come unto me, all ye that labour\
and are heavy laden,\
10:16\
and I will give you rest.”\
10:19\
“I will also ease the burdens which\
are put upon your shoulders,\
10:23\
that even you cannot feel\
them upon your backs,\
10:26\
even while you are in bondage; ...\
10:28\
that ye may know of a surety\
that I, the Lord God,\
10:33\
do visit my people\
in their afflictions.”\
10:38\
“I will not leave you comfortless:\
I will come to you.”\
10:43\
With joyful reverence, I witness our\
Savior lives and His promises are sure.\
10:50\
Especially for you who are troubled or\
who are afflicted in any manner,\
10:55\
I testify that our Heavenly Father\
hears your cheerful pleadings\
10:59\
and will always respond\
in perfect wisdom.\
11:03\
May God grant unto you, as He has done\
for our family in times of great need,\
11:09\
that your burdens may be light, even\
swallowed up in the joy of Christ.\
11:16\
In the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
