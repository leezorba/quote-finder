As we journey through mortality,\
we’re at times beset by trials:\
0:07\
the severe pain of the\
loss of loved ones.\
0:10\
The arduous fight against illness,\
the stink of injustice,\
0:16\
the harrowing experiences of harassment\
or abuse, the shadow of unemployment,\
0:24\
familial tribulations, the silent\
cry of loneliness, or\
0:29\
the heartrending consequences\
of armed conflicts.\
0:32\
In such moments, our souls\
yearn for refuge.\
0:37\
We seek earnestly to know, where\
may we find the balm of peace?\
0:43\
In whom can we place our trust to\
help us with the confidence and\
0:48\
the strength to surmount\
these challenges?\
0:51\
Who possesses the patience,\
0:53\
the encompassing love, and the\
omnipotent hand to uplift\
0:57\
and sustain us? The profound\
questions of the soul,\
1:02\
those that surface in our darkest hours\
1:05\
and highest trials, are\
addressed through\
1:08\
the unwavering love of Jesus Christ.\
1:12\
In Him and through the promised\
blessings of His restored gospel,\
1:17\
we find the answers we seek.\
1:19\
It is through His infinite Atonement\
that we are offered\
1:23\
a gift beyond measure—\
one of hope, healing,\
1:28\
and the assurance of His constant,\
enduring presence in our lives.\
1:33\
This gift is available to all\
who reach out with faith,\
1:38\
embracing the peace and redemption\
He so freely offers.\
1:43\
The Lord extends His hand to each of us,\
1:46\
a gesture that is the very essence\
of His divine love and kindness.\
1:51\
His invitation to us transcends\
a simple call;\
1:55\
It is a divine pledge, reinforced by\
the enduring power of His grace.\
2:01\
In the scriptures He lovingly\
assures us, Come unto me,\
2:07\
all ye that labour and are heavy laden,\
and I will give you rest.\
2:12\
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;\
for I am meek and lowly in heart:\
2:18\
and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\
2:22\
For my yoke is easy, and\
my burden is light.\
2:27\
The clarity of His invitation “Come\
unto me” and “Take my yoke” affirms\
2:33\
the profound nature of His promise—\
a promise so vast and complete,\
2:38\
that it embodies His love, offering\
us a solemn guarantee:\
2:44\
“Ye shall find rest.” As we diligently\
seek spiritual guidance,\
2:51\
as we embark on a deeply transformative\
odyssey that strengthens our testimony.\
2:59\
Comprehending the vastness of our\
Heavenly Father’s and Jesus Christ’s\
3:03\
perfect love, our hearts are filled\
with gratitude, humility,\
3:08\
and a renewed desire to pursue\
the path of discipleship.\
3:14\
President Russell M. Nelson taught that\
when the focus of our lives is\
3:18\
on God's plan of salvation and\
Jesus Christ and His gospel,\
3:23\
we can feel joy regardless of what is\
happening or not happening in our lives.\
3:30\
Joy comes from and because of Him.\
Alma, speaking to his son\
3:38\
Helaman, declared, And now, my son\
Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth,\
3:45\
and therefore I beseech of thee,\
3:48\
that thou will hear my words\
and learn of me.\
3:51\
For I do know that whosoever shall put\
their trust in God shall be supported\
3:57\
in their trials, and their troubles,\
and their afflictions,\
4:01\
and shall be lifted up at the last day.\
4:06\
Helaman, speaking to his sons,\
4:09\
taught about this eternal principle\
of putting the Savior at\
4:14\
the center of our lives. Remember,\
4:18\
remember that it is upon the rock\
of our Redeemer, who is Christ,\
4:24\
the Son of God, that ye must\
build your foundation.\
4:29\
In Matthew 14, we learn that after\
hearing of John the Baptist’s death,\
4:36\
Jesus sought solitude. However,\
a large crowd followed Him.\
4:44\
Moved by compassion and love,\
4:46\
and not allowing His grief to distract\
Him from His mission,\
4:51\
Jesus welcomed them, healing\
the sick among them.\
4:57\
As evening approached, the disciples\
faced a daunting challenge:\
5:03\
a multitude of people with\
scant food available.\
5:07\
They proposed that Jesus send the\
crowd away to procure food,\
5:13\
but Jesus, with high love\
and high expectations,\
5:18\
asked the disciples to\
feed them instead.\
5:22\
While the disciples were preoccupied\
with the immediate challenge,\
5:27\
Jesus demonstrated His trust\
and love for His Father,\
5:32\
coupled with an unwavering\
love for the people.\
5:37\
He directed the crowd to sit on the\
grass, and taking only five loaves\
5:42\
and two fish, He chose to give\
thanks to His Father,\
5:47\
acknowledging God’s provision over\
His authority and power.\
5:54\
After He gave thanks, Jesus\
broke the bread, and\
5:58\
the disciples distributed to the people.\
6:01\
Miraculously, the food\
not only sufficed\
6:04\
but was abundant, with twelve\
baskets of leftovers.\
6:11\
The group fed included 5,000 men,\
along with women and children.\
6:19\
These miracle teaches\
us a profound lesson:\
6:22\
When confronted with challenges,\
6:24\
it's easy to become engrossed\
in our difficulties.\
6:29\
However, Jesus Christ exemplified the\
power of focusing on His Father,\
6:34\
offering gratitude and acknowledging\
that solutions to our trials do not\
6:39\
always lie with ourselves, but with God.\
6:43\
When we encounter difficulties,\
6:46\
we naturally tend to concentrate\
on the obstacles we face.\
6:50\
Our challenges are tangible\
and command our attention,\
6:54\
yet the principle of surmounting\
them is in our focus.\
6:59\
By placing Christ at the core\
of our thoughts and deeds,\
7:04\
we align ourselves with His\
outlook and His strength.\
7:08\
This adjustment does not\
discount our struggles;\
7:12\
instead, it helps us to navigate through\
them under divine guidance.\
7:18\
As a result, we discover solutions\
and support that arise from\
7:23\
a higher wisdom. Adopting this Christ-\
centric perspective empowers us with\
7:30\
the fortitude and insight to turn\
our trials into victories,\
7:36\
reminding us that with the Savior,\
7:39\
what seems like a major\
problem can become\
7:42\
a pathway to greater spiritual progress.\
7:46\
The story of Alma the Younger in\
the Book of Mormon presents\
7:49\
a compelling narrative\
of redemption and\
7:52\
the profound impact of centering\
one's life around Christ.\
7:57\
At first, Alma stood as an opponent\
of the Lord’s Church,\
8:02\
leading many astray from the\
path of righteousness.\
8:05\
However, a divine intervention marked\
by an angelic visitation\
8:11\
awakened him from his wrongdoings.\
In his darkest hour,\
8:16\
tormented by guilt and desperate to find\
a way out of his spiritual anguish,\
8:24\
Alma remembered his father's teachings\
about Jesus Christ and\
8:29\
the power of His Atonement.\
With a heart\
8:32\
yearning for redemption, he earnestly\
repented and pleaded fervently for\
8:37\
the Lord's mercy. This crucial\
moment of complete surrender,\
8:42\
bringing Christ to the forefront\
of his thoughts\
8:45\
and earnestly seeking His mercy,\
triggered a remarkable transformation.\
8:52\
The heavy chains of guilt and despair\
vanished and were replaced by\
8:58\
an overwhelming sense of joy and peace.\
9:03\
Jesus Christ is our hope and the answer\
to life's greatest pains.\
9:09\
Through His sacrifice,\
He paid for our sins\
9:13\
and took upon Himself all of our\
suffering—pain, injustice, sorrow,\
9:20\
and fear—and He forgives and heals\
us when we trust in Him\
9:27\
and seek to change our\
lives for the better.\
9:31\
He is our healer, comforting\
9:34\
and repairing our hearts through\
His love and power,\
9:38\
just like He healed many during\
His time on earth.\
9:43\
He is the living water, fulfilling\
9:46\
the deepest needs of our souls with\
His constant love and kindness.\
9:52\
This is like the promise He made to\
the Samaritan woman at the well,\
9:57\
offering a well of water springing\
up into everlasting life.\
10:04\
I bear solemn witness that\
Jesus Christ lives,\
10:07\
that He presides over this\
His sacred Church,\
10:11\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
10:14\
I testify that He is the Savior of\
the world, the Prince of Peace,\
10:18\
the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords,\
the Redeemer of the world.\
10:23\
I affirm with certainty that we are\
ever-present in His mind and heart.\
10:28\
As a testament to this, He has restored\
His Church in these latter days\
10:33\
and has called President Russell\
M. Nelson as His prophet and\
10:38\
the president of the Church\
at this time.\
10:41\
I know that He gave His life so that\
we might have eternal life.\
10:46\
As we strive to place Him at\
the center of our lives,\
10:50\
revelations unfold to us,\
10:52\
His profound peace envelops us,\
10:54\
and His infinite Atonement brings about\
our forgiveness and healing.\
10:59\
It is in Him that we discover\
the strength to overcome,\
11:02\
the courage to persevere,\
11:04\
and the peace that surpasses\
all understanding.\
11:07\
May we strive each day to draw nearer to\
Him, the source of all that is good,\
11:14\
the beacon of hope in our journey back\
to the presence of our Heavenly Father.\
11:19\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
