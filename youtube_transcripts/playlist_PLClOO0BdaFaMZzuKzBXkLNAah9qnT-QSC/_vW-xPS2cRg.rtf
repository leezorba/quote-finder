Some time ago, I asked my wife,\
Can you tell me why,\
0:05\
as far as I remember, we never had\
any major problems in our lives?\
0:11\
She looked at me and said, Sure,\
I’ll tell you why\
0:14\
we never had any major problems. It’s\
because you have a very short memory.\
0:22\
Her quick and smart answer made me\
realize once again that living\
0:27\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
does not remove pain\
0:31\
and trials, which are necessary to grow.\
0:35\
The gospel is not a way to avoid\
challenges and problems,\
0:39\
but a solution to increase our faith\
and learn how to deal with them.\
0:45\
I had a sense of this truth a few months\
ago when I was walking one day,\
0:50\
and suddenly my sight became blurry,\
dark, and wavy. I was scared.\
0:57\
Then the doctors told me, if you don't\
begin treatment immediately,\
1:01\
you may lose your sight even\
in a matter of weeks.\
1:06\
I was even more scared. And then they\
said, you need intravitreal injections—\
1:12\
injections right in the eye,\
1:14\
wide-open eye, every four weeks\
for the rest of your life.\
1:20\
That was an uncomfortable wake-up call.\
1:23\
Then a reflection came in the form of\
a question. I asked myself, Okay,\
1:29\
my physical sight is not good. What\
about my spiritual vision?\
1:35\
Do I need any treatment there?\
1:37\
And what does it mean to have\
a clear spiritual vision?\
1:42\
I pondered about the story of a blind\
man called Bartimaeus described in\
1:48\
the Gospel of Mark. The scripture says,\
1:52\
And when he heard that it was Jesus of\
Nazareth, he began to cry out and say,\
1:57\
Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.\
2:01\
Technically, in the eyes of many, Jesus\
was just the son of Joseph.\
2:06\
So why did Bartimaeus call\
him son of David?\
2:11\
Simply because he recognized\
that Jesus was indeed\
2:15\
the Messiah and was prophesied to be\
born as a descendant of David.\
2:21\
It is interesting that this blind man,\
who didn't have physical sight,\
2:25\
recognized Jesus. He saw spiritually\
what he couldn't see physically,\
2:31\
while many others could see Jesus\
physically while were totally blind\
2:35\
spiritually. From this story, we learn\
more about clear spiritual vision.\
2:42\
We read, And many charged him that\
he should hold his peace,\
2:47\
but he cried the more a great deal.\
Thou son of David, have mercy on me.\
2:53\
All around him were telling\
him to be quiet,\
2:56\
but he cried even more because\
he knew who Jesus really was.\
3:01\
He ignored those voices and\
screamed even louder.\
3:06\
He acted instead of being acted upon.\
3:09\
Despite his limited circumstances,\
3:12\
he used his faith to go\
beyond his limitations.\
3:16\
So the first principle\
we learn is we keep\
3:20\
a clear spiritual vision when we focus\
3:23\
on Jesus Christ and stay true\
to what we know to be true.\
3:29\
Brothers and sisters, to keep\
our spiritual sight intact,\
3:33\
we need to decide not to listen to\
the voices of the world around us.\
3:38\
In this confusing and confused world,\
3:41\
we must stay faithful to what we know,\
faithful to our covenants,\
3:45\
faithful in keeping the commandments,\
3:47\
and reaffirm our beliefs even\
stronger, like this man did.\
3:53\
We need to cry even louder our testimony\
of the Lord to the world.\
3:59\
This man knew Jesus, stayed faithful\
to what he believed,\
4:03\
and was not distracted by\
the voices around him.\
4:08\
There are many voices today\
trying to lower our voices\
4:12\
as disciples of Jesus Christ.\
4:15\
The voices of the world are\
trying to silence us,\
4:18\
but that's exactly why we must declare\
our testimony of the Savior louder\
4:23\
and stronger. Among all the\
voices of the world,\
4:27\
the Lord is counting on me and you\
to declare our testimonies,\
4:31\
to raise our voice, and\
to become His voice.\
4:36\
If we don't do it, who will\
testify of Jesus Christ?\
4:40\
Who will speak His name and declare\
His divine mission?\
4:44\
We have a spiritual charge that comes\
from our knowledge of Jesus Christ.\
4:52\
But what did Bartimaeus do after that?\
At the Lord’s command to rise,\
4:58\
he acted again in faith. The scripture\
says, And he, casting away his garment,\
5:05\
rose and came to Jesus. This humble\
5:09\
and faithful man understood\
that he could rise to\
5:11\
a better life at Jesus’s command.\
5:14\
He knew that he was better\
than his circumstances,\
5:17\
and the very first thing he did when he\
heard Jesus calling him was to throw\
5:22\
away his beggar's coat. Again, he acted\
instead of being acted upon.\
5:29\
He might have thought, I don't\
need this anymore.\
5:31\
Now that Jesus has come into\
my life, this is a new day.\
5:35\
I'm done with this life of misery.\
5:38\
With Jesus, I can start a new life\
of happiness and joy in Him,\
5:42\
with Him, and through Him.\
5:43\
And I don't care what the\
world thinks of me,\
5:47\
Jesus is calling me and He will\
let me live a new life.\
5:53\
What a remarkable change.\
5:56\
As he threw away his beggar's coat,\
he got rid of all excuses.\
6:01\
And this is the second principle.\
6:03\
We keep a clear spiritual vision when\
we leave the natural man behind,\
6:07\
repent, and begin a new life in Christ.\
6:11\
The way to do it is by making and\
keeping covenants to rise to\
6:16\
a better life through Jesus Christ.\
6:19\
As long as we make excuses to\
feel sorry for ourselves,\
6:23\
sorry for our circumstances\
and problems,\
6:25\
and for all the bad things\
happening in our life,\
6:28\
and even all the bad people that\
we think make us unhappy,\
6:32\
we keep the beggar’s coat\
on our shoulders.\
6:36\
It is true that at times people,\
consciously or not, hurt us,\
6:41\
but we need to decide to act with faith\
in Christ by removing the mental\
6:47\
and emotional coat that we might still\
wear to hide excuses or sin\
6:52\
and throw it away, knowing that\
He can and will heal us.\
6:59\
There is never a good excuse\
to say I am the way I am\
7:03\
because of some unfortunate and\
unpleasant circumstances,\
7:06\
and I cannot change and I am justified.\
7:09\
When we think that way, we decide to be\
acted upon. We keep the beggar's coat.\
7:18\
Acting in faith means to\
rely on our Savior,\
7:20\
believing that through His Atonement\
we can rise above everything at His\
7:25\
command. The third principle is in the\
last four words: he came to Jesus.\
7:33\
How could he go to Jesus\
since he was blind?\
7:36\
The only way was to walk towards\
Jesus by hearing His voice.\
7:42\
And this is the third principle.\
7:44\
We keep a clear spiritual vision when\
we hear the voice of the Lord\
7:49\
and allow Him to guide us.\
7:53\
Just like this man raised his voice\
over the voices around him,\
7:58\
he was able to listen to the\
voice of the Lord in\
8:00\
the middle of all other voices.\
8:03\
This is the same faith that allowed\
Peter to walk on water,\
8:07\
as long as he kept his spiritual\
focus on the Lord\
8:10\
and was not distracted by\
the winds around him.\
8:16\
Then the story of this blind man ends\
with the words, He received his sight\
8:23\
and followed Jesus in the way.\
8:26\
One of the most important lessons in\
this story is that this man exercised\
8:31\
true faith in Jesus Christ\
and received a miracle\
8:34\
because he asked with real intent,\
the real intent to follow Him.\
8:41\
And this is the ultimate reason for\
8:43\
the blessings we receive in our life,\
which is to follow Jesus Christ.\
8:49\
It is about recognizing Him,\
8:51\
making and keeping covenants\
with God because of Him,\
8:55\
changing our very nature through\
Him, and enduring to\
8:59\
the end by following Him.\
9:02\
For me, keeping a clear spiritual\
vision is all about focusing\
9:08\
on Jesus Christ. So is my spiritual\
sight clear as I get my eye injections?\
9:18\
Well, who am I to say?\
9:23\
But I am grateful for what I see.\
9:27\
I clearly see the hand of the Lord in\
this sacred work and in my life.\
9:34\
I see the faith of many wherever I\
go who strengthen my own faith.\
9:40\
I see angels all around me.\
9:44\
I see the faith of many who don't\
see the Lord physically,\
9:47\
but recognize Him spiritually because\
they know Him intimately.\
9:52\
I testify that this gospel is\
the answer for everything,\
9:56\
because Jesus Christ is the\
answer for everyone.\
10:01\
I am grateful for what I can\
see as I follow my Savior.\
10:07\
I promise that as we hear the voice of\
the Lord and allow Him to guide us\
10:14\
on the Savior's covenant path, we will\
be blessed with clear vision,\
10:20\
spiritual understanding, and peace of\
heart and mind throughout our lives.\
10:26\
May we cry our testimony of Him louder\
than the voices around us.\
10:33\
In a world that needs to hear more\
of Jesus Christ and not less,\
10:39\
may we remove the beggar’s coat\
that we might still wear\
10:44\
and rise above the world to a better\
life in and through Christ.\
10:50\
May we get rid of all excuses\
not to follow Jesus Christ\
10:54\
and find all good reasons to follow Him\
as we hear His voice. It is my prayer\
11:03\
in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
