“How does your\
0:01\
Church differ from others?” My answer\
to this important question\
0:07\
has varied as I have\
0:09\
matured and as the Church has grown.\
0:12\
When I was born in Utah in\
0:14\
1932,\
0:16\
our Church membership was\
only about 700,000,\
0:21\
clustered mostly in Utah\
and nearby states.\
0:25\
At that time we had only seven temples.\
Today, the membership of The\
0:31\
Church of Jesus Christ\
0:32\
of Latter-day Saints numbers\
more than 17 million in about 170\
0:39\
nations. As of this April 1,\
0:44\
we have 189 dedicated temples\
0:48\
in many nations and 146 more in planning\
0:54\
and construction. I have felt to speak\
about the purpose of these temples\
1:01\
and the history and role of\
covenants in our worship.\
1:06\
This will supplement the inspired\
teachings of earlier speakers.\
1:12\
A covenant is a commitment to fulfill\
certain responsibilities.\
1:18\
Personal commitments are essential to\
the regulation of our individual lives\
1:24\
and to the functioning of society. This\
idea is currently being challenged.\
1:31\
A vocal minority oppose institutional\
authority\
1:36\
and insist that persons should be free\
from any restrictions that limit their\
1:42\
individual freedom. Yet we know from\
millennia of experience that persons\
1:49\
give up some individual\
freedoms to gain\
1:53\
the advantages of living in\
organized communities.\
1:58\
Such relinquishments of individual\
freedoms are principally based\
2:03\
on commitments or covenants\
expressed or implied.\
2:09\
Here are some examples of covenant\
responsibilities in our society: Judges.\
2:18\
Military. Medical personnel.\
And firefighters.\
2:27\
All of those involved in these familiar\
occupations make a commitment,\
2:33\
often formalized by oath or covenant,\
to perform their assigned duties.\
2:41\
The same is true of our full-\
time missionaries.\
2:45\
Distinctive clothing or name tags\
are intended to signify that\
2:51\
the wearer is under covenant,\
2:53\
and therefore has a duty\
to teach and serve,\
2:57\
and should be supported in that service.\
3:01\
A related purpose is to remind\
3:03\
the wearers of their covenant\
responsibilities.\
3:08\
There's no magic in their distinctive\
clothing or symbols,\
3:12\
only a needed reminder of the\
special responsibilities\
3:17\
the wearers have assumed.\
3:19\
This is also true of the symbols of\
the engagement and wedding rings,\
3:26\
and their role in giving\
notice to observers\
3:30\
or reminding wearers of covenant\
responsibilities.\
3:37\
What I’ve said about covenants\
3:39\
being a foundation for the regulation\
of individual lives applies\
3:44\
particularly to religious covenants.\
3:48\
The foundation and history of\
many religious affiliations\
3:52\
and requirements are based on covenants.\
3:56\
For example, the Abrahamic Covenant is\
fundamental to several great religious\
4:03\
traditions. It introduces\
4:07\
the holy idea of God’s covenant\
promises with His children.\
4:13\
The Old Testament frequently refers\
to God's covenant with Abraham\
4:18\
and his seed. The first part\
of the Book of Mormon,\
4:23\
which was written during the\
Old Testament period,\
4:27\
clearly demonstrates the role of\
covenants in the Israelite history\
4:32\
and worship. Nephi was told that\
4:36\
the Israelite writings of that period\
were, quote, “a record of the Jews,\
4:41\
which contains the covenants\
of the Lord,\
4:44\
which he hath made unto the house\
of Israel.” End of quote.\
4:49\
The books of Nephi make frequent\
reference to the Abrahamic Covenant,\
4:54\
and to Israel as the covenant\
people of the Lord.\
4:59\
The practice of covenanting with God\
5:02\
or religious leaders is also recorded\
in the Book of Mormon\
5:06\
writings about Nephi, Joseph in Egypt,\
King Benjamin, Alma, and Captain Moroni.\
5:17\
When the time came for the Restoration\
of the fullness of\
5:20\
the gospel of Jesus Christ, God called\
a prophet, Joseph Smith.\
5:26\
We do not know the full content of\
5:29\
the angel Moroni's early instructions\
to this maturing young prophet.\
5:36\
We do know he told Joseph that\
“God had a work for [him] to do,” and\
5:41\
that “the fullness of the everlasting\
gospel” must be brought\
5:47\
forth, including “the promises\
made to the fathers.”\
5:53\
We also know that the scriptures young\
Joseph read most intensively,\
5:59\
even before he was directed\
to organize a church, were\
6:03\
the many teachings about covenants he\
was translating in the Book of Mormon.\
6:10\
That book is the Restoration’s major\
source for the fulness of the gospel,\
6:16\
including God’s plan for His children,\
6:19\
and the Book of Mormon is filled\
with references to covenants.\
6:26\
Being well read in the Bible,\
6:28\
Joseph must have known of the\
book of Hebrews reference to\
6:32\
the Savior’s intent to, quote,\
6:35\
“make a new covenant with the house of\
Israel and with the house of Judah.”\
6:39\
End of quote. Hebrews also refers\
to Jesus as “the mediator of\
6:46\
the new covenant.” Significantly,\
6:50\
the biblical account of the Savior's\
mortal ministry is titled\
6:54\
“The New Testament,” a virtual symbol\
for “The New Covenant.”\
7:02\
Covenants were foundational in the\
Restoration of the gospel.\
7:07\
This is evident in the earliest\
steps the Lord directed\
7:11\
the Prophet to take in organizing\
His Church.\
7:15\
As soon as the Book of\
Mormon was published,\
7:18\
the Lord directed the organization\
of His restored Church,\
7:22\
soon to be named The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
7:27\
Revelation given in April 1830 directs\
that persons shall, quote, “be\
7:34\
received by baptism into his Church,”\
unquote, after they “witness”\
7:42\
[which means solemnly testify], quote,\
7:46\
“that they have truly repented\
of all their sins,\
7:50\
and are willing to take upon them\
the name of Jesus Christ,\
7:54\
having a determination to serve\
him to the end.” End of quote.\
8:00\
The same revelation directs that the\
8:02\
Church, quote, “meet together often to\
partake of bread and wine [water] in the\
8:09\
remembrance of the Lord Jesus Christ.”\
End of quote.\
8:13\
The importance of this ordinance\
is evident in\
8:17\
the words of covenants specified for\
the elder or priest who officiates.\
8:23\
He blesses the emblems of the bread for\
8:26\
“the souls of all those who partake\
of it” that they, quote,\
8:31\
“witness unto thee, O God,\
the Eternal Father,\
8:35\
that they are willing to take upon\
them the name of thy Son,\
8:39\
and always remember him and keep his\
commandments which he has given them,”\
8:46\
end of quote.\
8:49\
The central role of covenants in\
8:51\
the newly restored Church was reaffirmed\
in the preface the Lord gave\
8:57\
for the first publication\
of His revelations.\
9:01\
There the Lord declares that He has\
called Joseph Smith because\
9:07\
the inhabitants of the earth, quote,\
“have strayed from mine ordinances,\
9:12\
and have broken mine everlasting\
covenant.” End of quote.\
9:18\
This revelation further explains that\
His commandments are being given that\
9:24\
“mine everlasting covenant\
might be established.”\
9:31\
Today, we understand the role of\
covenants in the restored Church\
9:35\
and the worship of its members.\
9:38\
President Gordon B. Hinckley gave this\
summary of the effect of our baptism\
9:44\
and our weekly partaking\
of the sacrament.\
9:48\
He said, “Every member of this\
Church who has entered\
9:52\
the waters of baptism has become\
a party to a sacred covenant.\
9:58\
Each time we partake of the sacrament\
of the Lord's Supper,\
10:03\
we renew that covenant.” End of quote.\
10:08\
We've been reminded by many speakers\
at this conference that\
10:13\
President Russell M. Nelson often refers\
to the plan of salvation as\
10:19\
the “covenant path” that, quote,\
10:22\
“leads us back to [God], ... and is all\
about our relationship with God.” End of\
10:30\
quote. He teaches about the significance\
of covenants in our temple ceremonies,\
10:35\
and urges us to see the end from the\
beginning and to “think celestial.”\
10:45\
Now I speak more of temple covenants. In\
fulfillment of his responsibility\
10:51\
to restore the fulness of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ,\
10:55\
the Prophet Joseph Smith spent much\
of his final years directing\
11:00\
the construction of a temple\
in Nauvoo, Illinois.\
11:05\
Through him, the Lord revealed\
the sacred teachings,\
11:08\
doctrine, and covenants for his\
successors to administer in temples.\
11:15\
There, persons who were endowed were to\
be taught God’s plan of salvation\
11:21\
and invited to make sacred covenants.\
11:26\
Those who live faithful to those\
covenants were promised eternal life,\
11:31\
wherein “all things are theirs,”\
11:35\
and they “shall dwell in the presence\
of God and His Christ forever.”\
11:43\
The endowment ceremonies in\
11:44\
the Nauvoo Temple were administered just\
before our early pioneers were\
11:50\
expelled to begin their historic trek\
to the mountains in the West.\
11:56\
We have the testimonies\
of many pioneers that\
12:00\
the power they received from being bound\
to Christ in their endowments in\
12:07\
the Nauvoo Temple gave them the strength\
to make their epic journey\
12:12\
and establish themselves in the West.\
12:16\
Persons who have been endowed in a\
temple are responsible to wear\
12:22\
a temple garment, an article\
of clothing not visible\
12:27\
because it is worn beneath\
outer clothing.\
12:30\
It reminds endowed members of the\
sacred covenants they have made\
12:36\
and the blessings they have been\
promised in the holy temple.\
12:42\
To achieve those holy purposes,\
12:44\
we are instructed to wear temple\
garments continuously,\
12:49\
with the only exceptions being\
those obviously necessary.\
12:54\
Because covenants do not take\
12:57\
a day off, to remove one’s garments can\
be understood as a disclaimer of\
13:04\
the covenant responsibilities and\
blessings to which they relate.\
13:10\
In contrast, persons who wear\
their garments faithfully\
13:14\
and keep their temple covenants\
continually affirm their role\
13:20\
as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.\
13:25\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints is constructing temples all\
13:30\
over the world. Their\
purpose is to bless\
13:33\
the covenant children of God\
with temple worship,\
13:37\
and with the sacred responsibilities\
and powers\
13:41\
and unique blessings of being bound to\
Christ they receive by covenant.\
13:49\
The Church of Jesus Christ is known as\
13:52\
a church that emphasizes making\
covenants with God.\
13:57\
Covenants are inherent in each of\
the ordinances of salvation\
14:02\
and exaltation this restored Church\
administers. The ordinance of baptism\
14:09\
and its associated covenants are\
requirements for entrance into\
14:14\
the celestial kingdom. The ordinances\
and associated covenants of the temple\
14:22\
are requirements for exaltation\
in the celestial kingdom,\
14:27\
which is “eternal life, the greatest\
of all the gifts of God.”\
14:34\
That is the focus of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
14:41\
I testify of Jesus Christ, who\
is the head of that Church,\
14:46\
and invoke His blessings on all who seek\
to keep their sacred covenants.\
14:53\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
