Yesterday, my dear friend Elder Randall\
K. Bennett talked about patriarchal\
0:07\
blessings. It was a great message\
and inspired us all.\
0:12\
My dear brethren and sisters,\
0:14\
may I talk about patriarchal\
blessing as well?\
0:19\
Patriarchs, as requests for patriarchal\
blessing may increase,\
0:25\
I pray that the Lord will bless you\
0:28\
as you continue to magnify\
your callings.\
0:32\
As I go to stake conferences,\
0:34\
I always visit with the stake\
patriarch and his spouse.\
0:40\
Patriarchs are gentle, obedient, and\
incredible leaders called of God.\
0:47\
They tell me many wonderful\
spiritual experiences.\
0:51\
I ask them the age of the youngest and\
0:55\
the oldest person to whom they\
have given a blessing. So far,\
1:01\
the youngest was 11 and\
the oldest was 93.\
1:08\
I received my patriarchal blessing as a\
new member of the Church at age 19,\
1:14\
two years after I was baptized. My\
patriarch was incredibly old.\
1:22\
He joined the church in 1916 and was\
a pioneer of the Church in Japan.\
1:30\
It was my great honor to receive my\
patriarchal blessing from that\
1:35\
remarkable disciple of the Lord.\
1:39\
His Japanese was a bit difficult\
for me to understand,\
1:43\
but it was powerful. The patriarchs\
1:48\
I have met tell me that many individuals\
receive their patriarchal\
1:53\
blessing just before serving\
a mission.\
1:57\
My dear young men, young women,\
parents, and bishops,\
2:02\
patriarchal blessings are not only for\
preparation to serving a mission.\
2:09\
Worthy baptized members may receive\
their patriarchal blessing when\
2:14\
the time is right for them.\
The adult members.,\
2:20\
some of you have not yet received\
your patriarchal blessings.\
2:25\
Remember, there is no maximum age.\
2:32\
My mother-in-law was a very\
active Church member,\
2:37\
serving as a Relief Society teacher\
until she passed away at age 90.\
2:45\
I was sad to learn that she did not\
receive a patriarchal blessing.\
2:52\
She experienced many difficulties\
in her life,\
2:56\
and because she did not have a\
priesthood holder in the home,\
3:02\
she did not receive many\
priesthood blessings.\
3:07\
A patriarchal blessing may have given\
her comfort when she needed it most.\
3:15\
Adults, if you have not yet received\
a patriarchal blessing,\
3:20\
please do not worry. Everyone's\
spiritual timeline is different.\
3:27\
If you are 35 or 85 and\
you have a desire,\
3:32\
talk to your bishop about\
receiving your blessing.\
3:38\
New members of the Church, have you\
heard of a patriarchal blessings?\
3:44\
I didn’t know about the opportunity to\
receive one when I joined the Church,\
3:51\
but my beloved bishop told me and\
about patriarchal blessings\
3:58\
and encouraged me to prepare to receive\
mine after I was baptized.\
4:05\
My dear new members, you can receive\
a patriarchal blessing as well.\
4:11\
The Lord will help you prepare\
for this sacred opportunity.\
4:18\
Let's consider two purposes for\
a patriarchal blessing.\
4:23\
One, a patriarchal blessing contains\
personal counsel from the Lord to you.\
4:31\
Two, a patriarchal blessing declares\
your lineage in the House of Israel.\
4:38\
Your patriarchal blessing is\
4:40\
a message from your Heavenly Father\
and will likely include promises\
4:47\
and inspired counsel to guide\
you throughout your life.\
4:52\
A patriarchal blessing is not\
going to map out your life\
4:57\
or answer all your questions.\
5:01\
If it doesn't mention an\
important life event,\
5:05\
do not take that to mean you\
won’t have that opportunity.\
5:12\
Likewise, there is no guarantee\
everything in your blessing will come\
5:18\
to pass in this life. A patriarchal\
blessing is eternal,\
5:23\
and if you live worthy, promises that\
are not fulfilled in this life will\
5:30\
be granted in the next. As you see\
the declaration of your lineage,\
5:37\
you will come to know that you are\
of the House of Israel and\
5:42\
the seed of Abraham. To understand that\
significance of this, focus on\
5:49\
the promises the Lord made to the\
House of Israel through Abraham.\
5:55\
Those promises include, his posterity\
will be numerous,\
6:01\
his seed or descendants will\
receive the gospel and bear\
6:06\
the priesthood, through the\
ministry of his seed,\
6:11\
all the families of the\
earth will be blessed\
6:15\
even with the blessing of the gospel,\
6:18\
which are the blessing of the salvation,\
even of life eternal.\
6:24\
As members of Church, we are\
children of the covenant.\
6:29\
We receive the blessing of the\
Abrahamic Covenant as we obey\
6:34\
the laws and ordinances of the gospel.\
6:38\
Preparation for your patriarchal\
blessing will help you in increase your\
6:45\
faith in Heavenly Father\
and Jesus Christ.\
6:48\
And when you receive your patriarchal\
blessing and read and ponder it,\
6:54\
you can focus on them more often.\
6:58\
President Thomas S. Monson explained,\
“The same Lord who provided the Liahona\
7:03\
for Lehi provides for you\
and for me today a rare\
7:09\
and valuable gift to give\
direction to our lives,\
7:14\
to mark the hazards to our safety, and\
to chart the way, even safe passage—\
7:22\
not to a promised land, but\
to a heavenly home.\
7:28\
My dear bishops, parents, elders quorum,\
Relief Society presidents,\
7:33\
ward mission leaders, ministering\
brothers and sisters,\
7:37\
please encourage those young\
men and young women,\
7:42\
adult members, and new\
members who have not\
7:45\
yet received their patriarchal blessing\
to seek the Lord's direction\
7:50\
and help in preparing\
themselves to do so.\
7:56\
I frequently and prayerfully read\
my patriarchal blessing.\
8:00\
It always gives me encouragement.\
8:03\
I recognize what the Lord expects of me,\
8:07\
and it has helped me to\
repent and be humble.\
8:12\
When I read and ponder it,\
8:15\
I desire to live worthy of receiving\
its promised blessing.\
8:21\
Just as the scriptures we have read\
many times have new meaning to us\
8:27\
later, a patriarchal bblessing will have\
8:30\
a different meaning to us\
at different times.\
8:35\
Mine has a different meaning now than\
it did when I was 30 and when\
8:41\
I was 50. It is not that\
the words change,\
8:45\
but we see them in a different way.\
8:49\
President Dallin H. Oaks declared that\
the patriarchal blessing is given under\
8:55\
the inspiration of the Holy\
Spirit and should be read\
8:59\
and interpreted under the influence\
of that same Spirit.\
9:05\
The meaning and the significance of\
9:08\
a patriarchal blessing will be\
taught line upon line, in\
9:12\
the course of time, by the power of\
the same Spirit that inspired it.\
9:19\
Brothers and sisters, I bear my witness\
that Heavenly Father and His beloved\
9:27\
and Only Begotten Son, the Lord Jesus\
Christ, live. They love us.\
9:34\
Patriarchal blessings are\
sacred gifts from them.\
9:39\
When you receive your blessing,\
9:42\
you will realize and feel how They\
love you and how They focus\
9:49\
on you individually. The Book of Mormon\
is another testament of Jesus Christ,\
9:55\
and I am grateful to be led by a living\
prophet, President Russell M. Nelson.\
10:01\
I'm so grateful for our\
Savior Jesus Christ.\
10:05\
This Easter Sunday, I will focus\
on Him and His Resurrection\
10:10\
and worship Him and give thanks\
for His sacrifice.\
10:15\
I know He suffered so deeply because\
He loves us so deeply.\
10:21\
I know He was resurrected because\
of His love for us. He is real.\
10:28\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ.\
10:31\
Amen.\
