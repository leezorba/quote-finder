My dear brothers and sisters, we have\
been blessed by the inspired\
0:08\
teachings\
0:10\
and the beautiful music that have\
touched us in this opening session of\
0:17\
general conference. We thank you\
0:21\
for your participation\
0:24\
and for your faith.\
0:27\
Today I will speak on what\
I've learned about\
0:33\
the miracle of finding personal peace\
0:38\
whatever our circumstances,\
0:42\
The Savior knows that all of Heavenly\
Father’s children yearn for peace.\
0:51\
And He said He could give it to us.\
0:55\
You remember the words of Jesus Christ\
1:00\
recorded in the book of John: “Peace\
1:06\
I leave with you, my peace I give unto\
you; not as the world giveth\
1:15\
give I unto you. Let not your heart be\
troubled neither let it be afraid.”\
1:24\
What He means by peace and how He\
can give it are revealed by\
1:32\
the circumstances of those who\
heard Him speak those words.\
1:38\
Listen to the account in John of the\
culmination of Christ's ministry.\
1:49\
Fierce forces of evil were\
bearing down on Him\
1:55\
and would soon come upon His disciples.\
Here are the Savior’s words:\
2:04\
“If ye love me, keep my commandments.\
2:10\
And I will pray the Father,\
2:13\
and he shall give you another Comforter,\
that he may abide with you forever;\
2:23\
even the spirit of truth;\
2:26\
whom the world cannot receive\
because it seeth him not,\
2:33\
neither knoweth him: but ye know him;\
2:37\
for he dwelleth with you,\
and shall be in you.\
2:44\
I will not leave you comfortless: I will\
come to you. Yet a little while,\
2:53\
and the world seeth me no more;\
but ye see me: because\
3:00\
I live, ye shall live also.\
3:05\
At that day, ye shall know that I am in\
my Father,\
3:11\
and ye in me, and I in you.\
3:19\
He that hath my commandments\
and keepeth them,\
3:24\
he it is that loveth me:\
3:28\
and he that loveth me shall\
be loved of my Father,\
3:34\
and I will love him and will\
manifest myself to him.\
3:43\
Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot,\
3:47\
Lord, how is it that you will manifest\
yourself unto us and not unto\
3:55\
the world? Jesus answered and said\
unto him,\
4:02\
If a man love me,\
4:06\
he will keep my words: and my Father\
will love him, and we will come unto\
4:14\
him, and make our abode with him.\
4:19\
He that loveth me not\
keepeth not my sayings;\
4:24\
and the word which ye hear is not mine,\
but the Father’s which sent me.\
4:32\
These things have I spoken unto\
you, being yet present with you.\
4:39\
But the Comforter, which\
is the Holy Ghost,\
4:44\
whom the Father will send in my name,\
4:48\
he will teach you all things\
4:51\
and bring all things to your\
remembrance, whatsoever\
4:56\
I have said unto you. Peace\
I leave with you, my peace\
5:05\
I give unto you: not as the world\
giveth, give I unto you.\
5:12\
Let not your heart be troubled\
neither let it be afraid.”\
5:19\
I have learned at least five truths\
from that teaching of the Savior.\
5:27\
First, the gift of peace\
is given after we have\
5:35\
the faith to keep His commandments.\
5:39\
For those who are covenant members\
of the Lord’s Church,\
5:44\
obedience is what we have\
already promised to do.\
5:49\
Second, the Holy Ghost will\
come and abide with us.\
5:57\
The Lord says that as we continue\
to be faithful,\
6:00\
the Holy Ghost will dwell in us.\
6:04\
That is the promise in the\
sacramental prayer that\
6:09\
the Spirit will be our companion and\
that we would feel in our hearts\
6:15\
and minds His comfort. Third,\
6:21\
the Savior promises that as\
we keep our covenants,\
6:26\
we can feel the love of the Father and\
the Son for each other and for us.\
6:34\
We can feel their closeness\
in our mortal lives,\
6:39\
just as we will when we are blessed\
to be with Them forever.\
6:46\
Fourth, keeping the Lord’s commandments\
6:51\
requires more than obedience.\
6:55\
We are to love God with all our\
heart, might, mind, and soul.\
7:03\
Those who do not love Him do\
not keep His commandments.\
7:09\
And so they will not have the gift\
of peace in this life and in\
7:16\
the world to come. Fifth,\
7:21\
it is clear that the Lord loves us\
enough to pay the price of our sins\
7:28\
so that we can, through our faith\
in Him and our repentance,\
7:34\
through the effects of His Atonement,\
7:37\
have the gift of the peace that\
“passeth all understanding,”\
7:44\
in this life and with Him eternally.\
7:49\
Now some of you, perhaps many, are not\
feeling the peace the Lord promised.\
7:57\
You may have prayed for personal\
peace and spiritual comfort,\
8:02\
yet you may feel that the heavens are\
silent to your pleading for peace.\
8:11\
There is an enemy of your soul\
who does not want you\
8:16\
and those you love to find peace.\
He cannot enjoy it.\
8:23\
He works to prevent you from even\
wanting to find the peace\
8:28\
the Savior and our Heavenly\
Father desire you to have.\
8:36\
Satan's effort to sow hatred\
8:39\
and contention all around us\
seem to be increasing.\
8:46\
We see evidence of it happening among\
nations and cities, in neighborhoods,\
8:55\
in electronic media, and\
all across the world.\
9:01\
Yet there is reason for optimism.\
9:05\
It is that the light of Christ is\
placed in every newborn child.\
9:12\
With that universal gift comes\
a sense of what is right,\
9:19\
a desire to love and be loved.\
9:23\
There is an inborn sense of justice and\
truth in every child of God as he\
9:31\
or she comes into mortality.\
9:37\
Our optimism for personal peace\
for those children lies in\
9:43\
the people who care for them.\
9:46\
If those who rear them and serve\
them have worked to receive\
9:53\
the gift of peace from the Savior, they\
will, by personal example and effort,\
10:02\
encourage the faith of the child to\
qualify for the supernal gift of peace.\
10:11\
That is what the scripture promises:\
10:15\
“Train up a child in the way he should\
go: and when he is old,\
10:20\
he will not depart from it.”\
10:24\
It will require the one charged\
with the child's care\
10:30\
and nurturing to be worthy\
of the gift of peace.\
10:36\
Now, sadly, we have all felt the pain of\
children raised by inspired parents,\
10:43\
sometimes one parent alone,\
10:46\
and those children choose, after\
a lifetime of faith and peace,\
10:54\
to take the path of sorrow.\
10:58\
Even when that sadness occurs,\
11:01\
my optimism rests in another gift from\
11:05\
the Lord. It is this: That he raises\
up many peacemakers\
11:14\
among His trusted disciples. They have\
felt the peace and the love of God.\
11:22\
They have the Holy Ghost\
in their hearts.\
11:24\
And the Lord can guide them to reach\
out to the wandering sheep.\
11:32\
I have seen it over my lifetime\
and across the world.\
11:38\
You have seen it as well.\
11:41\
At times when you were being led to the\
rescue, it may seem accidental.\
11:49\
Once I simply asked someone\
I met on a trip,\
11:54\
“Would you tell me a little\
about your family?”\
11:58\
The conversation led me to seek to see\
12:02\
a picture of her adult daughter,\
who she said was struggling.\
12:08\
I was struck with the goodness in the\
face of that girl in the picture.\
12:17\
I felt impressed to ask if I could\
have her email address.\
12:24\
Her daughter, she had told me,\
12:26\
was at that moment lost and wondering if\
God had any message for her. He did.\
12:37\
It was this: “The Lord loves you.\
He always has.\
12:43\
The Lord wants you to come back. Your\
promised blessings are still in place.”\
12:53\
Members across the Church have felt\
the Lord’s gift of personal peace.\
13:02\
He is encouraging everyone\
to help others have\
13:06\
the opportunities to come\
unto Him and qualify\
13:11\
for that same peace themselves.\
13:14\
They, in turn, will choose to seek\
inspiration to know how they can pass\
13:22\
that gift along to others.\
13:26\
The rising generation will\
become the nurturers of\
13:32\
the generation to follow.\
13:35\
The multiplier effect will\
produce a miracle.\
13:40\
It will spread and grow over time,\
13:44\
and the Lord’s kingdom on\
earth will be prepared\
13:48\
and ready to greet Him with shouts of\
hosanna.\
13:53\
There will be peace on earth.\
13:59\
I bear my sure witness\
14:03\
the Savior lives, and He\
leads this, His Church.\
14:10\
I have felt His love in my life\
and His love and concern\
14:17\
for all of Heavenly Father's children.\
14:20\
The Savior’s invitation to come\
to Him is an offer of peace.\
14:28\
President Russell M. Nelson is the\
living prophet of God in all\
14:34\
the earth. He has said, “I give you\
my assurance that regardless of\
14:43\
the world's condition and your\
personal circumstances,\
14:48\
you can face the future with optimism\
and joy.” I express my love to you.\
14:58\
Your great faith and love are\
reaching people and allowing\
15:03\
the Lord to change hearts and so\
gain a desire to offer others\
15:09\
the gift of peace that passes\
all understanding.\
15:15\
I pray that you may may find peace,\
help many others to find it,\
15:21\
and pass it along. There will be\
15:25\
a wonderful thousand years of peace\
when the Lord comes again.\
15:31\
I so testify in joy and in\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
