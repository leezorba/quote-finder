How grateful I am to have served with\
such wonderful men and women of God\
0:06\
in the Young Men and Young\
Women Presidencies.\
0:08\
I love them and their families.\
Brothers and sisters,\
0:12\
one evening after work, years ago,\
0:15\
I boarded my usual bus home to New\
Jersey from New York City.\
0:20\
The woman I happened to sit next\
to noticed what I was writing\
0:23\
on my computer and asked, “You believe\
in Christ?” I said, “Yes, I do.”\
0:30\
As we talked, I learned\
she had just moved to\
0:33\
the area from her beautiful Asian\
country to work in New York's highly\
0:38\
competitive information\
technology sector.\
0:41\
Naturally, I asked her, “Do you\
know why I, as a Christian,\
0:46\
believe in Jesus Christ?” She,\
too, responded normally\
0:50\
and invited me to tell her.\
0:52\
But as I went to speak, I had one of\
those moments where many thoughts flood\
0:57\
your mind. This was the first\
time I would explain\
1:00\
the “why” of Christianity to someone\
very unfamiliar with it\
1:05\
and highly intelligent.\
I couldn’t simply say, “I\
1:10\
follow Jesus Christ because He willingly\
suffered and died for my sins.”\
1:15\
She might wonder,\
“Did Jesus have to die?\
1:19\
Couldn't God simply forgive\
1:21\
and cleanse us of our sins\
if we asked Him to?”\
1:25\
How would you have responded\
in a few minutes?\
1:28\
How would you explain this to a friend?\
Children and youth,\
1:34\
would you please ask your parents\
or a leader later on,\
1:38\
“Why did Jesus have to die?”\
And brothers and sisters,\
1:44\
I have a confession to make.\
1:46\
Despite all I thought I knew about\
Church doctrine, history,\
1:51\
policy, and so on, the answer to this\
central question to our faith did not\
1:57\
come so easily. That day,\
2:00\
I decided to focus more on what\
matters most to eternal life.\
2:06\
Well, I informed my new friend that we\
have a spirit in addition to a body\
2:12\
and that God is the Father\
of our spirits.\
2:16\
I told her we lived with our Heavenly\
Father before our births into this\
2:20\
mortal world. Because He loves\
her and all His children,\
2:24\
He made a plan for us\
to receive a body in\
2:28\
the image of His glorified body,\
be part of a family,\
2:32\
and return to His loving presence to\
enjoy eternal life with our families\
2:37\
like He does with His. But, I said, we\
would face two main obstacles in this\
2:45\
necessarily fallen world:\
2:47\
Physical death, the separation of\
our bodies from our spirits.\
2:52\
Of course, she knew we would all die.\
2:54\
And, 2, spiritual death, our\
separation from God\
2:59\
because our sins, mistakes, and flaws\
3:02\
as mortals distance us from His holy\
presence. She related to this, too.\
3:09\
I informed her that this was an\
effect of the law of justice.\
3:14\
This eternal law demands that\
an eternal penalty be paid\
3:19\
for every one of our sins or violations\
of God’s laws or truth\
3:25\
or we could never return to live in His\
holy presence. It would be unjust,\
3:31\
and God “cannot deny justice.”\
3:35\
She understood this, but easily grasped\
that God is also merciful,\
3:41\
loving, and eager to bring to\
pass our eternal life.\
3:46\
I informed my friend that we would also\
have a cunning, powerful adversary—\
3:51\
the source of evil and lies—opposing us.\
3:55\
Therefore, Someone with infinite,\
3:58\
godly power to overcome\
all such opposition\
4:02\
and obstacles would need to save us.\
4:05\
I then shared with her the good news—\
4:08\
“the glad tidings of great joy ... to\
all people”—that “God so loved the\
4:16\
world, that He gave\
his only begotten son,\
4:19\
that whosoever believeth in him should\
not perish, but have everlasting life.”\
4:26\
I testified to my friend and\
4:29\
I witness to you that Jesus\
Christ is that Savior.\
4:34\
That He had to suffer,\
die, and rise again—\
4:38\
His infinite Atonement—to\
redeem all humanity\
4:43\
from physical death and to give\
eternal life with God\
4:47\
and our families to all who would follow\
him. The Book of Mormon declares,\
4:54\
“Thus, God ... gained the\
victory over death; giving\
4:57\
the Son power to make intercession\
for the children of men ...;\
5:02\
being filled with [mercy and]\
compassion ... ;\
5:05\
having broken the bands of death,\
taken upon himself\
5:10\
their iniquity and their transgressions,\
5:12\
having redeemed them and satisfied\
the demands of justice.”\
5:18\
The steps God revealed we must\
take to follow Jesus\
5:22\
and receive eternal life are called\
the doctrine of Christ.\
5:26\
They include “faith in Jesus Christ\
and His atonement, repentance,\
5:32\
baptism [into The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints],\
5:37\
receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost,\
and enduring to the end.”\
5:42\
I shared these steps with my friend,\
5:44\
but here are some ways\
in which prophets\
5:47\
and apostles have recently taught how\
5:49\
the doctrine of Christ can\
bless all God's children.\
5:53\
President Russell M. Nelson instructed,\
“The pure doctrine of Christ is\
5:59\
powerful. It changes the life of\
everyone who understands it\
6:04\
and seeks to implement it\
in his or her life.”\
6:08\
Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught,\
“[the] For the Strength of Youth [guide]\
6:11\
is bold in declaring the\
doctrine of ... Christ [and] inviting\
6:16\
you [youth] to make choices based\
on it.” Elder Dale G. Renlund\
6:22\
taught, “We invite missionaries\
to do what they ask those they teach\
6:27\
to do: apply the doctrine of Christ in\
their lives [and] get on and stay on\
6:33\
the covenant path.” The doctrine of\
Christ empowers those who are\
6:38\
struggling or feel they don’t belong in\
the Church because it helps them,\
6:44\
as Elder D. Todd Christofferson stated,\
6:47\
“affirm: Jesus Christ died for\
me ... and loves me.” Parents,\
6:54\
if your child struggles with a gospel\
principle or prophetic teaching,\
7:00\
please resist any type of evil speaking\
or activism toward the Church\
7:06\
or its leaders. These lesser secular\
approaches are beneath you\
7:13\
and can be lethal to the long-term\
faithfulness of your child.\
7:18\
It speaks so well of you that you\
would protect or advocate\
7:23\
for your precious child or show signs\
of solidarity with him or her.\
7:30\
But my wife, Jayne, and I know from\
personal experience that teaching your\
7:36\
beloved child why we all desperately\
need Jesus Christ and how to apply His\
7:42\
joyful doctrine is what will strengthen\
and heal him or her.\
7:48\
Let us turn them to Jesus, who is their\
true Advocate with the Father.\
7:55\
The Apostle John taught,\
“Whosoever ... abideth in\
7:58\
the doctrine of Christ ... hath both\
the Father and the Son.”\
8:02\
He then warns us to beware,\
8:05\
quote, “If there come any unto you\
and bring not this doctrine,”\
8:11\
close quote. Jayne and\
I recently visited\
8:16\
the wilderness where Moses held\
up a serpent of brass before\
8:19\
the wandering children of Israel.\
8:22\
The Lord had promised to heal all who\
were bitten by poisonous snakes if they\
8:27\
would simply look upon it.\
8:29\
In holding up the doctrine\
of Christ before us,\
8:33\
the Lord’s prophet is doing the same,\
8:36\
“that He should heal the nations.”\
8:39\
Whatever the bites or poison\
8:41\
or struggles we experience in\
this mortal wilderness,\
8:44\
let us not be as those who, anciently\
and presently, could have been healed,\
8:49\
but sadly “would not look ... because\
they did not believe that it would heal\
8:57\
them.” The Book of Mormon affirms,\
“Behold, ...\
8:59\
this is the way; and there\
is none other way\
9:03\
nor name given under heaven whereby man\
can be saved in the kingdom of God.\
9:08\
And now behold, this is the\
doctrine of Christ.”\
9:14\
That evening in New Jersey, sharing\
why we need Jesus Christ\
9:19\
and His doctrine gave me a new\
sister and her a new brother.\
9:25\
We felt the peaceful, confirming\
witness of the Holy Ghost.\
9:30\
Naturally, I invited her to share her\
contact information and continue\
9:35\
the conversation with our missionaries.\
She was happy to do so.\
9:40\
“Wherefore, how great the importance\
to make these things known unto\
9:44\
the inhabitants of the earth,”\
the Book of Mormon says.\
9:48\
To love, share, and invite as we gather\
Israel in all our communities\
9:54\
and families that “they may know that\
there is no flesh that can dwell in\
10:00\
the presence of God, save it\
10:03\
be through the merits, and mercy,\
and grace [and doctrine] of\
10:08\
the Holy Messiah.” In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
