The ancient prophet Enoch, described\
in the Old Testament,\
0:06\
the Doctrine and Covenants, and\
0:08\
the Pearl of Great Price was\
instrumental in establishing\
0:12\
the City of Zion. The scriptural account\
of Enoch's call to serve\
0:17\
indicates that “he heard a voice from\
heaven saying: Enoch, my son,\
0:23\
prophesy unto this people,\
and say unto them—\
0:27\
Repent, ... for their hearts have waxed\
hard, and their ears are dull of hearing\
0:33\
and their eyes cannot see afar off.\
0:37\
And when Enoch had heard these words,\
0:40\
he bowed himself to the earth ... and\
spake before the Lord, saying,\
0:44\
Why is it that I have found favor in\
thy sight, and am but a lad, and all\
0:50\
the people hate me, for I am slow of\
speech; wherefore am I thy servant?”\
0:58\
Please notice that at the time of\
Enoch’s call to serve, he became acutely\
1:05\
aware of his personal inadequacies\
and limitations.\
1:09\
And I suspect all of us, at one time\
1:11\
or another in our Church service\
have felt much like Enoch.\
1:16\
But I believe the Lord's response\
to Enoch's pleading question is\
1:21\
instructive and applies\
to each of us today.\
1:25\
“And the Lord said unto Enoch:\
1:27\
Go forth and do as I have commanded\
thee and no man shall pierce thee.\
1:32\
Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled,\
and I will give the utterance. ...\
1:38\
Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore\
all thy words will I justify;\
1:44\
and the mountains shall\
flee before you and\
1:46\
the rivers shall turn from their course;\
1:49\
and thou shalt abide in me and I in you;\
therefore walk with me.”\
1:59\
Enoch ultimately became\
a mighty prophet and\
2:02\
a tool in God's hands to accomplish\
a great work.\
2:05\
But he did not start his\
ministry that way.\
2:09\
Rather, his capacity over time was\
magnified as he learned to abide in\
2:15\
and walk with the Son of God.\
2:19\
I earnestly pray for the help of the\
Holy Ghost as we consider together\
2:24\
the counsel given to Enoch by the Lord\
and what it can mean for you\
2:29\
and me today. The Lord Jesus Christ\
extends to each of us\
2:35\
the invitation to abide in Him.\
2:38\
But how do we actually learn\
and come to abide in Him?\
2:44\
The word “abide” denotes remaining fixed\
or stable and enduring without yielding.\
2:51\
Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained\
that “abiding” as\
2:54\
an action means, quote, “‘[to] stay—\
but [to] stay forever.’\
2:59\
That is the call of the gospel message\
to ... everyone ... in the world.\
3:04\
Come, but come to remain. Come with\
conviction and endurance.\
3:09\
Come permanently, for your\
sake and the sake of all\
3:13\
the generations who must follow you.”\
Close quote.\
3:17\
Thus, we abide in Christ as we are firm\
and steadfast in our devotion to\
3:24\
the Redeemer and His holy purposes\
in times both good and bad.\
3:31\
We begin to abide in\
3:34\
the Lord by exercising our moral agency\
to take upon ourselves His yoke through\
3:40\
the covenants and ordinances\
of the restored gospel.\
3:44\
The covenant connection we have with our\
Heavenly Father and His resurrected\
3:49\
and living Son is the supernal source\
of perspective, hope, power,\
3:55\
peace, and enduring joy. It also is\
4:00\
the rock solid foundation upon which\
we should build our lives.\
4:04\
We abide in Him by striving continually\
to strengthen our individual covenant\
4:10\
bond with the Father and the Son.\
4:13\
For example, praying sincerely\
to the Eternal Father in\
4:18\
the name of His Beloved Son deepens\
4:21\
and fortifies our covenant\
connection with them.\
4:25\
We abide in Him by truly feasting\
upon the words of Christ.\
4:31\
The Savior’s doctrine draws\
us, as children of the\
4:35\
covenant, closer to Him and will tell\
us all things what we should do.\
4:41\
We abide in Him by preparing earnestly\
to participate in the ordinance of\
4:45\
the sacrament, reviewing and reflecting\
on our covenant promises,\
4:51\
and repenting sincerely.\
4:54\
Worthily partaking of the sacrament is\
4:56\
a witness to God that we are willing\
to take upon ourselves\
5:00\
the name of Jesus Christ and strive\
to “always remember Him”\
5:05\
after the brief period of time required\
to participate in that sacred ordinance.\
5:12\
And we abide in Him by serving\
God as we serve His children\
5:16\
and minister to our brothers\
and sisters.\
5:19\
The Savior said, “If ye keep my\
commandments, ye shall abide in my love;\
5:26\
even as I have kept my Father’s\
commandments and abide in His love.”\
5:33\
I briefly have described several of\
the many ways we can abide in\
5:36\
the Savior, and I now invite each of\
us, as His disciples, to ask, seek,\
5:43\
knock, and learn for ourselves by\
the power of the Holy Ghost\
5:48\
other meaningful ways\
we can make Christ\
5:51\
the center of our lives\
in all that we do.\
5:55\
The Savior’s promise to His\
followers is twofold:\
5:59\
if we abide in Him, He will abide in us.\
6:04\
But is it indeed possible for Christ\
to abide in you and me—individually\
6:12\
and personally? The answer to this\
question is a resounding yes!\
6:19\
In the Book of Mormon, we learn about\
Alma's teaching and testifying to\
6:23\
the poor, whose afflictions had\
compelled them to be humble.\
6:29\
In his instruction, he compared the word\
to a seed that must be planted\
6:34\
and nourished. And he described “the\
word” as the life, the mission,\
6:40\
and the atoning sacrifice\
of Jesus Christ.\
6:45\
Alma said, “Begin to believe\
in the Son of God,\
6:49\
that he will come to redeem his people,\
and that he shall suffer\
6:54\
and die to atone for their sins;\
6:57\
and that he shall rise\
again from the dead,\
6:59\
which shall bring to pass\
7:01\
the resurrection, that all men shall\
stand before him, to be judged at\
7:06\
the last and judgment day, according\
to their works.”\
7:10\
Now, brothers and sisters, given this\
description of “the word” by Alma,\
7:16\
please consider the inspiring connection\
he then identifies.\
7:22\
“And now ... I desire that ye shall\
plant this word in your hearts,\
7:27\
and as it beginneth to swell even so\
nourish it by your faith. And behold,\
7:33\
it will become a tree, springing up\
in you unto everlasting life.\
7:39\
And then may God grant unto you that\
your burdens may be light, through\
7:44\
the joy of his Son. And even all\
this can ye do if ye will.”\
7:50\
The seed we should strive to plant\
in our hearts is the word—\
7:55\
even the life, mission, and\
doctrine of Jesus Christ.\
8:00\
And as the word is nourished by faith,\
8:03\
it can become a tree springing up\
in us unto everlasting life.\
8:10\
What was the symbolism of the\
tree in Lehi's vision?\
8:15\
The tree can be considered as a\
representation of Jesus Christ.\
8:22\
My beloved brothers and sisters, is\
the Word in us? Are the truths of\
8:29\
the Savior’s gospel written in the\
“fleshy tables” of our hearts?\
8:34\
Are we coming unto and gradually\
becoming more like Him?\
8:37\
Is the tree of Christ growing in us?\
8:42\
Are we striving to become\
new creatures in Him?\
8:47\
Perhaps this miraculous potential\
inspired Alma to ask, “Have ye\
8:53\
spiritually been born of God? Have ye\
received his image in your countenances?\
9:00\
Have you experienced this mighty\
change in your hearts?”\
9:05\
We should always remember the\
Lord’s instruction to Enoch:\
9:08\
“Thou shalt abide in me and\
I in you.” And I testify\
9:16\
the Savior’s promise to\
abide in us is true\
9:20\
and available to every covenant-keeping\
member of His restored Church.\
9:27\
The apostle Paul admonished believers\
who had received the Lord,\
9:31\
“so walk ye in him.” Walking in and with\
9:37\
the Savior highlights two vital\
aspects of discipleship: One,\
9:42\
obeying God’s commandments. And two,\
9:45\
remembering and honoring the sacred\
covenants that connect us to\
9:50\
the Father and the Son. John declared,\
“And hereby\
9:55\
we do know that we know him, if\
we keep his commandments.\
10:01\
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth\
not his commandments, is a liar,\
10:07\
and the truth is not in him. But\
whoso keepeth his word, in him\
10:14\
verily is the love of God perfected:\
hereby know we that we are in him.\
10:22\
He that saith he abideth in him\
10:24\
ought himself also so to walk,\
even as he walked.”\
10:30\
Jesus beckons to each of\
us, “Come follow me and walk with me.”\
10:39\
I testify that as we press forward in\
faith and walk in the meekness of\
10:44\
the Lord’s Spirit, we are blessed with\
power, guidance, protection, and peace.\
10:52\
Alma describes a loving entreaty from\
the Lord to all living souls:\
10:57\
“Behold, he sendeth an invitation\
to all men, for\
11:02\
the arms of mercy are extended\
towards them,\
11:06\
And he saith: Repent, and\
I will receive you.\
11:10\
... Come unto me and ye shall partake of\
the fruit of the tree of life;\
11:16\
yea, ye shall eat and drink of the bread\
and the waters of life freely.”\
11:23\
I emphasize the absolute\
comprehensiveness of the Savior's plea.\
11:28\
He yearns to bless with His grace\
11:31\
and mercy every single\
person who now lives,\
11:34\
who has ever lived, and who will\
yet live upon the earth.\
11:40\
Some Church members accept as true the\
11:43\
doctrine, principles, and testimonies\
proclaimed repeatedly\
11:48\
from this pulpit in the\
Conference Center\
11:50\
and in local congregations\
around the world,\
11:54\
and yet may struggle to believe these\
eternal truths apply specifically in\
12:02\
their lives and to their circumstances.\
12:05\
They believe sincerely\
and serve dutifully,\
12:09\
but their covenant connection\
with the Father\
12:11\
and His redeeming Son has\
not yet become a living\
12:16\
and transforming reality in their lives.\
12:21\
I promise that by the power\
of the Holy Ghost,\
12:26\
you can know and feel the gospel truths\
12:30\
I have attempted to describe\
are for you,\
12:36\
for you individually and personally.\
12:41\
I joyfully witness that Jesus Christ\
is our loving and living Savior\
12:47\
and Redeemer. If we abide in Him,\
He will abide in us.\
12:55\
And as we walk in and with Him, we will\
be blessed to bring forth much fruit.\
13:02\
I so testify,\
13:06\
in the sacred name of the\
Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
