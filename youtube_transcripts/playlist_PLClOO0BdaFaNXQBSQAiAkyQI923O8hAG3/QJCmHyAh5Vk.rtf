The Lord Jesus Christ said,\
“I am the good shepherd:\
0:07\
the good shepherd giveth\
his life for the sheep. ...\
0:11\
As the Father knoweth me,\
even so know I\
0:14\
the Father: and I lay down\
my life for the sheep.” In the Greek\
0:19\
version of this scripture, the word\
for “good” also means “beautiful,\
0:27\
magnificent.” So today I wish to\
speak of the Good Shepherd,\
0:33\
the Beautiful Shepherd, the\
Magnificent Shepherd,\
0:37\
even Jesus Christ. In the New Testament\
0:42\
He is called the Great Shepherd,\
0:45\
the Chief Shepherd, and the Shepherd\
and Bishop of our souls.\
0:50\
In the Old Testament, Isaiah wrote\
that “He shall feed his flock like\
0:58\
a shepherd.” In the Book of Mormon,\
1:00\
He is called “the good shepherd” and\
“the great and true shepherd.”\
1:06\
In the Doctrine and Covenants\
He declares:\
1:10\
“Wherefore, I am in your midst,\
and I am the good shepherd.”\
1:15\
In our day, President\
Nelson has declared,\
1:19\
“The Good Shepherd lovingly cares\
for all the sheep of His fold,\
1:23\
and we are His true undershepherds.\
1:26\
Our privilege is to bear His love and\
to add our own love to friends\
1:32\
and neighbors—feeding, tending,\
and nurturing them as\
1:37\
the Savior would have us do.”\
1:39\
More recently, President Nelson has\
said, “A hallmark of the Lord’s true\
1:45\
and living Church will always\
be an organized,\
1:50\
directed effort to minister to\
individual children of God\
1:54\
and their families. Because\
it is His Church,\
1:59\
we, as His servants, will minister\
to the one just as He did.\
2:06\
We will minister in His name, with\
His power and authority,\
2:12\
and with His loving-kindness.”\
Close quote.\
2:16\
When the Pharisees and scribes\
murmured against\
2:19\
the Lord saying, “This man receiveth\
sinners, and eateth with them,”\
2:24\
He responded by presenting three\
beautiful stories that we have come to\
2:32\
know as the parable of the lost sheep,\
the parable of the lost coin,\
2:38\
and the parable of the prodigal son.\
2:41\
It's interesting to note that when Luke,\
the gospel writer,\
2:46\
is introducing the three stories, he\
uses the word parable in the singular,\
2:52\
not in the plural. It appears that\
2:56\
the Lord is teaching one unique\
lesson with three stories,\
3:01\
stories that present different numbers—\
100 sheep, ten coins, and two sons.\
3:09\
The key number in each of these stories,\
however, is the number one.\
3:17\
And a lesson we might take from that\
number is that you might be\
3:22\
an undershepherd for 100 elders\
3:24\
and prospective elders in your elders\
quorum or an advisor to ten young women\
3:31\
or a teacher to two Primary children,\
3:35\
but you always, always minister to them,\
3:40\
care for them, and love them\
one by one individually.\
3:46\
You never say, “What a foolish sheep.”\
Or\
3:50\
“After all, I do not really need that\
coin.” Or “What a rebellious son he is.”\
3:58\
If you and I have with us\
the pure love of Christ,\
4:03\
we as the man in the story of the\
lost sheep will “leave the ninety\
4:08\
and nine ... and go after that which is\
lost until [until, until we] find it.”\
4:20\
Or as the woman in the story\
of the lost coin,\
4:23\
we will “light a candle and sweep\
the house and seek diligently\
4:29\
[diligently till, till,]\
till we find it.”\
4:37\
If we have with us the\
“pure love of Christ,”\
4:40\
we will follow the example of\
the father in the story of\
4:43\
the prodigal son, who, when the\
son “was yet a great way off,\
4:48\
[he] saw him and had compassion\
4:54\
and ran and fell on his\
neck and kissed him.”\
5:00\
Can we feel the urgency and the heart\
of the man who lost only one sheep?\
5:06\
Or the urgency in the heart of the\
woman who lost just one coin?\
5:13\
Or the ineffable love and compassion in\
the heart of the prodigal’s father?\
5:20\
My wife, Maria Isabel, and I\
serve in Central America,\
5:24\
being stationed in Guatemala City.\
5:26\
There I had the opportunity to meet\
Julia, a faithful member of the Church.\
5:32\
I had the impression to ask\
her about her family.\
5:35\
Her mother died of cancer in 2011.\
5:39\
Her father had been a faithful\
leader in his stake.\
5:44\
Serving as a bishop and as a counselor\
to his stake president\
5:48\
for several years. He was a true\
undershepherd of the Lord.\
5:54\
Julia told me of his tireless efforts\
to visit, to minister, and to serve.\
6:00\
He indeed rejoiced in feeding and\
tending the precious sheep of\
6:07\
the Lord. He remarried and stayed\
active in the Church.\
6:12\
A few years later, he went\
through a divorce\
6:15\
and now he had to attend church alone\
once again. He felt out of place,\
6:25\
and also felt that some people were\
critical of him because of his divorce.\
6:31\
He stopped attending church as a\
negative spirit filled his heart.\
6:36\
Julia spoke highly of this wonderful\
undershepherd who was a hard working,\
6:43\
loving, and compassionate man.\
6:46\
I vividly remember that a feeling\
of urgency came to me\
6:52\
as she was describing him. I just wanted\
to do something for that man,\
6:59\
a man that had done so much for so\
many throughout those years.\
7:08\
She gave me his cell phone number\
and I began calling him,\
7:13\
hoping to have the chance to\
meet with him personally.\
7:17\
After several weeks and many, many\
phone calls without success,\
7:23\
one day he finally answered the phone.\
7:27\
I told him that I had met Julia,\
his daughter,\
7:31\
and that I was captivated by\
the way he had served,\
7:35\
ministered, and loved the precious sheep\
of the Lord for so many years.\
7:42\
He was not expecting a\
comment like that.\
7:45\
I told him that I really wanted to visit\
with him eye to eye, face to face.\
7:54\
He asked me my purpose in proposing\
such a meeting. I replied,\
8:03\
“I really want to meet the father\
of such a wonderful lady.”\
8:08\
Then for a few seconds, there\
was silence over the phone.\
8:17\
A few seconds that seemed\
to me like an eternity.\
8:23\
He simply said, “When and where?”\
The day I met him,\
8:31\
I invited him to share with me some of\
his experiences visiting, ministering,\
8:37\
and serving the precious sheep\
of the Lord.\
8:43\
As he was recounting some\
touching stories,\
8:46\
I noticed that the tone of his voice\
changed and the same spirit,\
8:54\
the same spirit he had felt so many\
times as an undershepherd came back.\
9:03\
Now his eyes were filled with tears.\
9:07\
I knew this was the right moment for me.\
But I found that I didn’t know\
9:15\
what to say. I prayed in my mind,\
“Father, help me!” Suddenly,\
9:26\
I heard myself saying,\
“Brother Florian,\
9:34\
as a servant of the Lord, I apologize\
for our not being there for you.\
9:44\
Please, forgive us. Give us another\
chance to show you that we do love you,\
9:53\
that we need you, that you\
are important to us.”\
10:05\
The following Sunday,\
10:07\
he was back.\
10:09\
He had a long conversation with his\
bishop and remained active.\
10:16\
A few months later, he passed away. But\
he had come back. He had come back.\
10:26\
I testify that with our Savior's help,\
10:30\
we can love His precious sheep and\
minister to them as He would.\
10:36\
And so there in Guatemala City, the\
Lord Jesus Christ brought back\
10:44\
one more precious sheep into His fold.\
10:50\
And he taught me a lesson on ministering\
that I cannot forget.\
10:58\
In the name of the Good Shepherd,\
the Beautiful Shepherd,\
11:07\
the Magnificent Shepherd, even\
the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
