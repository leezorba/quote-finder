Dear brothers and sisters,\
0:04\
we have been spiritually fed\
during these last two days.\
0:09\
The choir music was superb.\
0:13\
Those who have\
spoken have been instruments for\
0:17\
the Lord. I pray that you will seek for\
0:21\
the Holy Ghost to guide\
you in your study\
0:24\
as you contemplate the truths\
taught from this pulpit.\
0:29\
They have truly been heaven sent. One\
week from today is Easter Sunday.\
0:38\
It is the most important\
religious observation\
0:43\
for followers of Jesus Christ.\
0:47\
The main reason we celebrate Christmas\
is because of Easter.\
0:54\
The Come, Follow Me lesson this\
week will prompt you to study\
0:58\
the Savior’s triumphant entry into\
Jerusalem, His cleansing of the temple,\
1:04\
His suffering in the Garden of\
Gethsemane, His Crucifixion,\
1:10\
His glorious resurrection, and His\
subsequent appearances to His followers.\
1:18\
Savor these sacred verses\
1:21\
and find every way you can to thank our\
Heavenly Father for sending us His\
1:28\
Only Begotten Son. Because\
of Jesus Christ,\
1:34\
we can repent and be forgiven\
of our sins. Because of Him,\
1:41\
each of us will be resurrected.\
1:48\
I also invite you to study\
again the account of\
1:50\
the Savior's appearance to the\
Nephites in the Americas\
1:55\
as recorded in 3 Nephi.\
2:01\
Not long before that appearance, His\
voice was heard among the people,\
2:07\
including these words of supplication,\
quote:\
2:14\
“Will ye not now return unto\
me, and repent of your sins,\
2:19\
and be converted, that I may heal you?\
2:24\
... Behold, my arm of mercy is\
extended towards you,\
2:29\
and whosoever will come, him will\
I receive.” Close quote.\
2:39\
Dear brothers and sisters,\
2:40\
Jesus Christ extends that same\
invitation to you today.\
2:46\
I plead with you to come unto\
Him so that He can heal you.\
2:54\
He will heal you from sin as you repent.\
2:58\
He will heal you from sadness and fear.\
3:03\
He will heal you from the\
wounds of this world.\
3:10\
Whatever questions or problems you have,\
3:13\
the answer is always found in the life\
and teachings of Jesus Christ.\
3:20\
Learn more about His Atonement, His\
love, His mercy, His doctrine,\
3:29\
and His restored gospel of healing\
and progression. Turn to Him.\
3:38\
Follow Him. Jesus Christ is the\
reason we build temples.\
3:46\
Each is His holy house.\
Making covenants\
3:51\
and receiving essential ordinances\
in the temple,\
3:55\
as well as seeking to draw closer to Him\
there, will bless your life in ways\
4:02\
no other kind of worship can.\
4:07\
For this reason, we are doing\
all within our power to make\
4:10\
the blessings of the temple more\
accessible to our members around\
4:16\
the world. Today, I'm grateful to\
announce our plans to build\
4:23\
a new temple in each of the following\
locations: Retalhuleu, Guatemala;\
4:32\
Iquitos, Peru; Teresina, Brazil;\
Natal, Brazil;\
4:41\
Tuguegarao City, Philippines;\
4:45\
Iloilo, Philippines; Jakarta, Indonesia;\
4:53\
Hamburg, Germany; Lethbridge, Alberta,\
Canada; San Jose, California.\
5:04\
Bakersfield, California; Springfield,\
Missouri; Charlotte, North Carolina;\
5:14\
Winchester, Virginia; and Harrisburg,\
Pennsylvania.\
5:23\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
5:24\
I bear witness that Jesus Christ directs\
the affairs of His Church.\
5:30\
I testify that following Him is the\
only way to enduring happiness.\
5:39\
I know that His power is descending\
upon His covenant-keeping\
5:45\
people, “armed with\
righteousness and with\
5:50\
the power of God in great glory.”\
5:54\
I so testify with my love and\
blessing for each of you.\
6:01\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
