When I was a young boy. I loved Saturday\
because everything I did\
0:07\
on that day seemed like an adventure.\
0:10\
But no matter what I did,\
0:12\
it was always preceded by\
0:14\
the most important thing of all—watching\
cartoons on television.\
0:19\
One such Saturday morning,\
0:21\
as I was standing by the television\
and flipping through channels,\
0:25\
I discovered that the cartoon I expected\
to find had been replaced by\
0:31\
a broadcast of the general\
conference of\
0:33\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
0:37\
While looking at the television and\
lamenting that there was no cartoon,\
0:41\
I saw a white-haired man in a suit\
and tie sitting in a nice chair.\
0:47\
There was something different about him.\
0:50\
So I asked my oldest brother,\
“Who is that?”\
0:54\
He said, “That’s President David O.\
McKay. He’s a prophet.”\
0:59\
I remember feeling something and\
somehow knowing that he was\
1:06\
a prophet. And then, because I was\
a cartoon-crazed young boy,\
1:11\
I changed the channel. But I've never\
forgotten what I felt during that brief,\
1:18\
unexpected, revelatory moment\
with a prophet.\
1:22\
Sometimes it only takes a moment\
to know. Knowing by revelation\
1:28\
that there's a living prophet on\
the earth changes everything.\
1:32\
It causes one to be uninterested\
in the debate about when is\
1:36\
a prophet speaking as a prophet,\
1:38\
or whether one is ever justified in\
selective rejection of prophetic\
1:43\
counsel. Such revealed knowledge invites\
one to trust the counsel of\
1:50\
the living prophet, even if we\
do not fully understand it.\
1:53\
After all, a perfect and loving\
Father in Heaven has chosen\
1:58\
the pattern of revealing truth to\
His children through a prophet,\
2:03\
someone who never sought\
such a sacred calling\
2:06\
and who has no need of our help to be\
aware of his own imperfections.\
2:11\
A prophet is someone God has personally\
prepared, called, corrected, inspired,\
2:17\
rebuked, sanctified, and sustained.\
2:20\
That's why we are never spiritually at\
risk in following prophetic counsel.\
2:27\
Now, whether we like it or not,\
2:28\
all of us were chosen\
in some fashion in\
2:30\
the pre-earth life to be born\
in these latter days.\
2:34\
And there are two realities that are\
associated with the latter days.\
2:38\
The first reality is that Christ’s\
Church will be reestablished on\
2:42\
the earth. And the second reality is\
that things are going to get really\
2:46\
challenging. The scriptures reveal that\
in the last days there will be\
2:51\
“a great hailstorm sent forth to destroy\
the crops on the earth,” plagues, “wars\
2:55\
and rumors of wars, and the whole\
earth shall be in commotion, ...\
2:59\
and iniquity shall abound.”\
3:02\
When I was a child, those prophecies\
of the last days scared me\
3:07\
and caused me to pray that\
3:09\
the Second Coming would not come in\
my lifetime—with some success,\
3:14\
I might add, so far. But now\
I pray for the opposite,\
3:19\
even though the prophesied\
challenges are assured,\
3:22\
because when Christ returns to reign,\
3:25\
all of His creations will\
“lie down safely.”\
3:29\
Current conditions in the world\
have caused some to panic.\
3:33\
As God’s covenant children,\
3:35\
we do not need to chase after this\
3:37\
or that to know how to navigate\
through these troubled times.\
3:41\
We do not need to fear. The doctrine\
3:44\
and principles that we must follow\
to survive spiritually\
3:47\
and endure physically are found in\
the words of a living prophet.\
3:52\
That’s why President M. Russell Ballard\
declared that “it is no small thing ...\
3:58\
to have a prophet of God in our midst.”\
4:01\
President Russell M. Nelson has\
testified that “God’s long-established\
4:06\
pattern of teaching His children through\
prophets assures us that He will bless\
4:11\
each prophet and that He will bless\
those who heed prophetic counsel.”\
4:16\
So the key is to follow the living\
prophet. Brothers and sisters,\
4:21\
unlike vintage comic books\
and classic cars,\
4:25\
prophetic teachings do not become\
more valuable with age.\
4:29\
That is why we should not seek to use\
the words of past prophets to dismiss\
4:35\
the teachings of living prophets.\
4:38\
I love the parables used by Jesus Christ\
to teach gospel principles,\
4:43\
and I’d like to share one real-life\
parable of sorts with you this morning.\
4:49\
One day I walked into the cafeteria at\
Church headquarters to have some lunch,\
4:53\
and after getting a tray of food,\
4:54\
I entered the dining area and I noticed\
4:56\
a table at which all three members of\
4:59\
the First Presidency were seated\
along with one empty chair.\
5:04\
My insecurities caused me to make a\
quick detour away from that table.\
5:10\
And then I heard the voice\
of our prophet,\
5:12\
President Russell M. Nelson, saying,\
“Allen, there’s an empty chair right\
5:17\
here. Come and sit down with us.”\
And so I did.\
5:21\
Near the end of the lunch,\
5:22\
I was surprised to hear a\
loud crunching noise.\
5:27\
And when I looked up, I saw that\
President Nelson had stood his plastic\
5:31\
water bottle straight up and then\
flattened it and replaced the lid.\
5:38\
President Dallin H. Oaks\
then asked the question\
5:41\
I wanted to ask. “President Nelson, why\
did you flatten your plastic water\
5:47\
bottle?” He replied, “It makes it easier\
5:50\
for those who are handling recyclable\
materials because it doesn't take up\
5:54\
as much space in the\
recycling container.”\
5:58\
While pondering that response,\
6:00\
I heard the same crunching sound\
again and I looked to my right,\
6:04\
and President Oaks had flattened\
his plastic water bottle,\
6:08\
just like President Nelson.\
6:09\
And then I heard some\
noise to my left,\
6:12\
and President Eyring was flattening\
his plastic water bottle,\
6:16\
although he had adopted a different\
strategy by doing it while it was\
6:19\
horizontal, which took more effort\
than with the bottle straight up\
6:23\
and noticing this, President\
Nelson kindly showed him\
6:26\
the bottle-straight-up technique to\
more easily flatten the bottle.\
6:32\
At that point, I leaned over to\
President Oaks and I asked,\
6:35\
“Is flattening your plastic water bottle\
a new recycling requirement of\
6:40\
the cafeteria?” And President Oaks\
responded with a smile on his face,\
6:45\
“Well, Allen, you need to\
follow the Prophet.”\
6:52\
Now, I'm confident that President Nelson\
was not declaring some new\
6:56\
recycling-based doctrine in\
the cafeteria that day.\
7:01\
But we can learn from the prompt\
response of President Oaks\
7:05\
and President Eyring to President\
Nelson’s example,\
7:08\
and President Nelson's attentiveness\
to help teach those involved\
7:12\
a better way. Elder Neal A. Maxwell\
shared some observations\
7:17\
and counsel that are prophetically\
on point with respect to our day.\
7:21\
Quote: “In the months and years ahead,\
7:24\
events are likely to require each member\
to decide whether or not he\
7:28\
[or she] will follow\
the First Presidency.\
7:30\
Members will find it more difficult to\
halt longer between two opinions. ...\
7:36\
Let us leave a record so that\
the choices are clear,\
7:40\
letting others do as they will in\
the face of prophetic counsel. ...\
7:44\
Jesus said that when the fig trees\
put forth their leaves,\
7:48\
‘summer is nigh.’ Thus warned\
that summer is upon us,\
7:52\
let us not then complain\
of the heat,” end quote.\
7:56\
The rising generation is growing up in\
a time when there are more fig leaves\
8:02\
and there is more heat. And\
that reality imposes\
8:06\
a weightier responsibility on the\
already-risen generation,\
8:09\
particularly when it comes to\
following prophetic counsel.\
8:13\
When parents ignore the counsel\
of a living prophet,\
8:17\
they not only lose the promised\
blessings for themselves,\
8:20\
but even more tragically,\
8:22\
teach their children that what a\
prophet says is insignificant,\
8:27\
or that prophetic counsel\
can be picked through in\
8:30\
a smorgasbord fashion\
without concern for\
8:34\
the resulting spiritual malnutrition.\
Elder Richard L. Evans\
8:38\
once observed, quote:\
8:40\
“Some parents mistakenly feel that they\
can relax a little as to conduct\
8:44\
and conformity, ... that they\
can ease up a little on\
8:47\
the fundamentals without affecting their\
family or their family's future.\
8:51\
But if a parent goes a\
little off course,\
8:54\
the children are likely to exceed\
the parents example.” As\
9:00\
a generation that has the sacred charge\
to prepare the rising generation\
9:04\
for its prophesied role\
in the latter days,\
9:06\
which role must be fulfilled\
in a time when\
9:08\
the adversary’s influence\
is at its peak,\
9:12\
we cannot be a source\
of confusion about\
9:15\
the importance of following\
prophetic counsel.\
9:18\
It is that very counsel that will allow\
the rising generation to see\
9:22\
“the enemy while he [is] yet afar off\
9:24\
and then [they can make] ready to\
withstand the enemy’s attack.”\
9:29\
Our seemingly small deviations,\
9:31\
quiet neglect, or whispered criticisms\
in response to prophetic counsel, may\
9:37\
result in our only walking dangerously\
near the edge of the covenant path.\
9:41\
But when magnified by the adversary in\
the lives of the rising generation,\
9:46\
such actions may influence them\
to leave that path altogether.\
9:50\
Such a result is a generational\
price that is too high.\
9:54\
Now, some of you may feel like you've\
fallen short in your efforts to follow\
9:58\
the counsel of President Russell M.\
Nelson. If that’s the case, then repent.\
10:04\
Begin again to follow the counsel\
of God's chosen Prophet.\
10:08\
Set aside the distraction of childish\
cartoons and trust the Lord's anointed.\
10:15\
Rejoice because once again, “there\
is a prophet in Israel.”\
10:21\
Even if you’re unsure, I witness that\
we can withstand the heat of\
10:27\
the latter days and even thrive in them.\
10:31\
We are the Saints of the latter\
days and these are great days.\
10:35\
We were anxious to come to\
the earth at this time,\
10:38\
having confidence that we would not be\
left to stumble when confronted by\
10:42\
the adversary’s increasingly darker\
and more confusing myths,\
10:47\
but rather to take counsel\
10:48\
and direction from he who is authorized\
to say to us and the entire world,\
10:55\
“Thus saith the Lord God.” In the\
sacred name of the Prophet\
11:00\
who God raised up, the holy one of\
Israel, even Jesus Christ, amen.\
