In fulfillment of the prophecy\
given to Zechariah,\
0:05\
Jesus triumphantly entered\
the holy city\
0:09\
riding upon a donkey, which was\
considered in literature\
0:14\
an ancient symbol of Jewish royalty as\
indeed befitted the King of Kings\
0:20\
and Prince of Peace. Surrounded by\
0:23\
a multitude of jubilant disciples\
who spread out their garments,\
0:28\
palm leaves, and other foliage along\
the path where Jesus passed,\
0:33\
they praised God, saying\
with a loud voice,\
0:37\
“Blessed be the King that cometh\
in the name of the Lord:\
0:42\
peace in heaven, and glory\
in the highest.”\
0:45\
And again, “Hosanna to the Son of David:\
0:49\
Blessed is he that cometh in the name\
of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.”\
0:56\
This majestic event which we celebrate\
on this day known as Palm Sunday\
1:03\
was a joyful prelude to the excruciating\
events that would\
1:07\
occur during that fateful week,\
1:10\
culminating in the Savior's\
selfless sacrifice and\
1:14\
the magnificent miracle\
of the empty tomb.\
1:18\
As His followers, we are His peculiar\
people called to proclaim His virtues,\
1:25\
promoters of the peace so generously\
offered through Him\
1:30\
and His atoning sacrifice.\
1:33\
This peace is a gift promised to all\
who turn their hearts to the Savior\
1:38\
and live righteously. Such peace gives\
us the strength to enjoy mortal life\
1:45\
and enables us to endure the painful\
trials of our journey.\
1:50\
In 1847, the Lord gave specific\
instructions to\
1:54\
the pioneer Saints who needed peace\
to remain calm and united\
2:00\
as they face unexpected difficulties\
on their westward journey.\
2:06\
Among other things, the Lord instructed\
2:09\
the Saints to cease to contend\
with one another,\
2:13\
cease to speak evil of one another.\
2:16\
The scriptures affirm that those who\
practice works of righteousness\
2:22\
and strive to walk in the meekness of\
the Spirit of the Lord are promised\
2:28\
the peace they need to survive\
2:30\
the days of commotion in\
which we live today.\
2:34\
As disciples of the Prince of Peace,\
2:37\
we have been instructed\
to live with hearts\
2:40\
knit together in unity and love,\
one to towards another.\
2:46\
Our beloved prophet, President Russell\
M. Nelson, recently stated,\
2:51\
“Contention violates everything the\
Savior stood for and taught.”\
2:57\
Our prophet also implored that we do all\
we can to end personal conflicts\
3:04\
that are currently raging in our\
hearts and in our lives.\
3:09\
Let us consider these principles in\
view of Christ's pure love for us\
3:15\
and that we, as His followers,\
seek to have for one another.\
3:20\
The scriptures define this\
kind of love as charity.\
3:24\
When we think of charity,\
3:27\
our minds usually turn to the generous\
acts and donations to relieve\
3:32\
the suffering of those who are\
experiencing physical, material,\
3:36\
or emotional difficulties.\
3:39\
Still, charity is not only related to\
something we donate to someone,\
3:45\
but it is an attribute of the Savior,\
3:48\
we can become part, and can become\
part of our character.\
3:53\
It is not surprising that the Lord\
instructed to “clothe [ourselves] with\
4:00\
the bond of charity, ... which is the\
bond of perfectness and peace.”\
4:05\
Without charity, we are nothing, and\
we cannot inherit the place\
4:11\
the Lord has prepared for us in the\
mansions of our Heavenly Father.\
4:16\
Jesus perfectly exemplified what it\
means to own this bond of perfection\
4:23\
and peace, especially when facing\
4:26\
the agonizing events that\
preceded His martyrdom.\
4:31\
Think for a moment about what\
Jesus must have felt\
4:36\
as He humbly washed His disciples feet,\
4:39\
knowing that one of them would\
betray Him that very night.\
4:45\
Or when Jesus, hours later, mercifully\
healed the ear of of\
4:50\
the one man who had accompanied Judas,\
his betrayer, to arrest Him.\
4:56\
Or even when the Savior is standing\
in front of Pilate,\
5:01\
was unfairly accused by the\
chief priests and elders,\
5:05\
and not a word He uttered against\
the false charges against Him,\
5:10\
and He left the Roman governor\
marveling. Through these three tragic\
5:16\
incidents, the Savior, despite being\
burdened with excessive sadness\
5:22\
and stress, taught us by His example\
that charity suffered long\
5:29\
and is kind, envieth not,\
vaunteth not itself,\
5:34\
is not puffed up, doth not\
behave itself unseemly,\
5:40\
seeketh not her own, is not easily\
provoked, and thinketh no evil.\
5:47\
Another important aspect to emphasize,\
5:51\
and one that has direct implications on\
our discipleship and how we promote\
5:57\
the peace of the Savior, is\
5:59\
the manner in which we treat each other.\
During His earthly ministry,\
6:05\
the Savior’s teachings focused not only,\
6:08\
but particularly, on the virtues\
of love, charity, patience,\
6:13\
humility, and compassion: fundamental\
attributes to those who want to become\
6:20\
closer to Him and promote His peace.\
6:24\
Such attributes are gifts from God,\
and as we strive to develop them,\
6:30\
we will begin to see our\
neighbors’ differences\
6:33\
and weaknesses with more empathy,\
sensitivity, respect, and tolerance.\
6:41\
One of the most evident signs that we\
are drawing closer to the Savior\
6:46\
and becoming more like\
Him is the loving,\
6:50\
patient, and kind way which we\
treat our fellow beings,\
6:56\
whatever the circumstances.\
6:59\
We often see people who engage in\
negative and derogatory comments about\
7:05\
the perceived characteristics,\
weaknesses, and opinions of others,\
7:10\
mainly when such characteristics\
and opinions differ\
7:15\
or contradict how they act and think.\
7:18\
It is very common to see\
these people passing\
7:22\
on such comments to others, who repeat\
what they heard without truly knowing\
7:28\
all the circumstances surrounding\
a situation.\
7:32\
Unfortunately, social media\
encourages this kind of behavior in\
7:37\
the name of relative truths\
or transparency.\
7:42\
Without restraint, digital\
conversation often leads people to\
7:47\
personal attacks and heated disputes,\
creating disappointments,\
7:52\
wounding hearts, and spreading\
flaming hostility.\
7:57\
Nephi prophesied that\
in the latter days,\
8:01\
the enemy would rage and stir up people\
to anger against what is good.\
8:07\
The scriptures teach that, “Every thing\
which inviteth and enticeth to do good,\
8:13\
and to love God, and to serve\
him is inspired of God.”\
8:18\
On the other hand, “That which\
is evil cometh of the devil;\
8:23\
for the devil is an enemy unto God, and\
fighteth against him continually,\
8:30\
and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and\
to do which is evil continually.”\
8:37\
Considering this prophetic teaching,\
8:40\
it is not surprising that one of\
8:43\
the adversary’s tactics is to\
stir up enmity and hate in\
8:49\
the hearts of God's children.\
8:52\
He rejoices when he sees\
people criticizing,\
8:55\
ridiculing, and slandering one another.\
8:59\
This behavior can destroy a person’s\
character, reputation, and self-esteem,\
9:04\
particularly when judged unfairly.\
9:08\
It is critical to point out that when we\
allow this type of attitude in our\
9:14\
lives, we make room in our hearts\
for the enemy to plant\
9:20\
the seed of discord among us, risking\
falling into his voracious trap.\
9:28\
If we are not careful with our thoughts,\
words, and actions,\
9:32\
we may end up being entangled by the\
cunning tricks of the enemy,\
9:39\
destroying our relationships with the\
people around us and our loved ones.\
9:46\
Brothers and Sisters, as the\
Lord’s peculiar people\
9:50\
and promoters of His peace,\
9:53\
we cannot afford to allow\
these tricks of\
9:57\
the evil one to take place\
in our hearts.\
10:01\
We cannot carry such a corrosive burden\
that destroys feelings, relationships,\
10:06\
and even lives. The gospel represents\
good tidings of great joy.\
10:13\
Of course, none of us is perfect,\
10:16\
and certainly there are times when we\
are beguiled into this type of behavior.\
10:22\
In His perfect love and omniscient\
knowledge of our human tendencies,\
10:28\
the Savior always tries to\
warn us of such dangers.\
10:33\
He taught us, “For with what judgment\
ye judge ye shall be judge;\
10:39\
and with what measure ye meet, it\
shall be measured to you again.”\
10:46\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
10:48\
as we strive to develop attributes\
like the Saviors,\
10:52\
we can become instruments of\
His peace in the world\
10:57\
according to the pattern that\
He Himself established.\
11:02\
I invite you to consider ways we can\
transform ourselves into uplifting\
11:08\
and supportive people. People who have\
an understanding and forgiving heart.\
11:14\
People who look for the best in others,\
11:17\
always remembering that “if there\
is anything virtuous,\
11:22\
lovely, or of good report\
or praiseworthy,\
11:26\
we seek after these things.”\
11:29\
I promise you that as we pursue\
and develop these attributes,\
11:34\
we will become more and more\
cordial and sensitive to\
11:38\
the needs of our fellow beings.\
11:41\
And we will experience joy, peace,\
and spiritual growth.\
11:46\
Undoubtedly, the Lord will recognize\
our efforts and give us\
11:52\
the gifts we need to be more tolerant\
11:54\
and patient with one another's\
differences,\
11:57\
weaknesses, and imperfections.\
12:00\
Furthermore, we will be better able\
to resist the urge to take offense\
12:06\
or offend those who hurt us,\
as did the Savior.\
12:11\
Our desire to forgive those\
who mistreated us\
12:14\
or speak evil about us\
will surely increase\
12:18\
and we will become part of\
our character. May we\
12:23\
today, on this Palm Sunday,\
12:26\
we spread out our robes of love\
and palm leaves of charity,\
12:31\
walking in the footsteps\
of the Prince of Peace\
12:35\
as we prepare to celebrate this coming\
Sunday the miracle of the empty tomb.\
12:41\
As brothers and sisters in Christ,\
12:44\
let us joyfully proclaim “Hosanna\
to the Son of David:\
12:49\
Blessed is he that cometh in the name\
of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.”\
12:56\
I testify that Jesus Christ lives\
12:59\
and that His perfect love, expressed\
through His atoning sacrifice,\
13:05\
is extended to all who desire\
to walk with Him\
13:08\
and enjoy His peace in this world\
and in the world to come.\
13:13\
I say these things in the holy name of\
the Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ.\
13:19\
Amen.\
