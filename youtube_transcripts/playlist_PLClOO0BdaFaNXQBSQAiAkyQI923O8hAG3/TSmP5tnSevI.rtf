In this beautiful Easter season, I echo\
the prayer of this powerful hymn.\
0:08\
“Guide us. Guide us, O\
thou great Jehovah.”\
0:15\
A remarkable story in the Book of\
Mormon tells of a young man from\
0:19\
a prominent family named Alma,\
0:22\
who the scriptures describe as\
an idolatrous unbeliever.\
0:27\
He was articulate and convincing,\
0:30\
using flattery to persuade\
others to follow him.\
0:34\
Astonishingly, an angel appeared\
to Alma and his friends.\
0:40\
Alma fell to the earth and was\
0:42\
so weak that he was carried helplessly\
to his father's home.\
0:46\
He remained in a seemingly comatose\
state for three days.\
0:52\
Later, he explained that while he\
appeared unconscious to those around\
0:56\
him, his mind was very active\
as his soul grieved\
1:01\
thinking about the life of disregarding\
the commandments of God.\
1:06\
He described his mind as being harrowed\
up by the memory of his many sins\
1:12\
and racked with eternal torment.\
1:16\
In his deep despair, he remembered\
being taught in his youth about\
1:21\
the coming of one Jesus Christ,\
a Son of God,\
1:26\
to atone for the sins\
of the world. Next,\
1:30\
he made this very compelling statement.\
1:34\
“As my mind caught hold upon this\
thought, I cried within my heart:\
1:40\
O Jesus, thou Son of\
God, have mercy on me.”\
1:46\
As he appealed for the divine\
power of the Savior,\
1:50\
something miraculous happened.\
1:53\
“When I thought this,” he said, “I could\
remember my pains no more.”\
1:59\
Suddenly, he felt peace and light.\
2:03\
Nothing was so exquisite and sweet,\
as was my joy, he declared.\
2:09\
Alma caught hold upon the\
truth of Jesus Christ.\
2:13\
If we were using the words “caught\
2:16\
hold upon” in a physical sense,\
2:19\
we might say he caught hold upon the\
guard rail just as he was falling.\
2:26\
Meaning he reached out suddenly\
and tightly seized,\
2:30\
something solidly cemented to a secure\
foundation. In Alma’s case,\
2:38\
it was his mind that reached out\
2:40\
and secured this powerful truth of Jesus\
Christ’s atoning sacrifice.\
2:45\
Acting in faith on that truth, and\
by the power and grace of God,\
2:51\
he was rescued from despair\
and filled with hope.\
2:57\
While our experiences may not\
be as dramatic as Alma's,\
3:02\
they are nonetheless as\
eternally significant.\
3:07\
Our minds have also caught hold upon\
this thought of Jesus Christ and His\
3:12\
merciful sacrifice. And our souls have\
felt the light and joy that follows.\
3:20\
My prayer at this Easter season\
3:24\
is that we will more consciously shape,\
strengthen, and secure\
3:30\
this preeminent thought of Jesus Christ\
in the chambers of our soul,\
3:35\
allowing us to, allowing it to\
eagerly flow into our mind,\
3:40\
guiding us in what we think and do,\
3:44\
and continually bringing the sweet\
joy of the Savior's love.\
3:51\
Filling our mind with the power of Jesus\
Christ does not mean that He that\
3:57\
He is the only thought we have.\
4:00\
But it does mean that all our thoughts\
are circumscribed in His love,\
4:07\
His life and teachings, and His atoning\
sacrifice and glorious Resurrection.\
4:14\
Jesus is never in a forgotten corner,\
4:19\
because our thoughts of\
Him are always present\
4:22\
and all that is in us\
adores Him. We pray\
4:29\
and rehearse in our mind experiences\
that have brought us closer to Him.\
4:34\
We welcome into our mind divine images,\
4:38\
holy scriptures, and inspired\
hymns to gently cushion\
4:43\
the countless daily thoughts rushing\
through our busy lives.\
4:48\
Our love for Him does not shield\
us from the sadness\
4:52\
and sorrow in this mortal life,\
4:55\
but it allows us to walk\
through the challenges\
5:00\
with a strength far beyond\
our own. “Jesus,\
5:04\
the very thought of thee with sweetness\
fills my breast; but sweeter\
5:10\
far thy face to see and\
in thy presence rest.”\
5:17\
Remember you are a spirit child\
of Heavenly Father.\
5:22\
As the Apostle Paul explains,\
“We are the offspring of God.”\
5:28\
You have lived with your own individual\
identity long before coming to Earth.\
5:35\
Our Father created a perfect plan\
for us to come to Earth,\
5:38\
learn, and return to Him. He sent\
His beloved Son, that through\
5:45\
the power of His infinite Atonement\
and Resurrection,\
5:48\
we live beyond the grave.\
5:50\
And as we are willing to exercise faith\
in Him and repent of our sins,\
5:56\
we are forgiven and receive\
the hope of eternal life.\
6:04\
In this mortal life, our mind and spirit\
need exceptional attention.\
6:10\
Our mind allows us to live, to choose,\
and to discern good and evil.\
6:16\
Our spirit receives the confirming\
witness that God is our Father,\
6:21\
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,\
6:24\
and that Their teachings are\
our guide to happiness here\
6:29\
and eternal life beyond the grave.\
6:32\
The mind of Alma caught hold upon this\
thought of Jesus Christ and it changed\
6:38\
his life. General Conference is\
a time to understand what\
6:44\
the Lord would have us do and become.\
6:47\
It is also a time to reflect\
on our progress.\
6:51\
As my assignments have taken\
me throughout the world,\
6:56\
I have observed an increasing spiritual\
strength in the righteous,\
7:01\
devoted members of the Church.\
7:04\
Five years ago, we were asked to place\
7:07\
the Savior more prominently in all\
we do by using the true name of\
7:12\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
7:16\
We are speaking His name more earnestly.\
Four years ago,\
7:22\
by reducing the time of\
our sacrament meeting,\
7:25\
we increased our focus on partaking\
of the Lord's sacrament.\
7:31\
We are thinking more of Jesus Christ and\
are more serious in our promise to\
7:36\
always remember Him. With the isolation\
of the worldwide pandemic\
7:43\
and the help of Come Follow Me,\
7:46\
the teachings of the Savior are becoming\
more prominent in our homes,\
7:51\
helping our worship of\
the Savior during\
7:54\
the week. By following President Russell\
M. Nelson’s counsel to “Hear Him,”\
8:01\
We are refining our ability to\
recognize the whisperings of\
8:05\
the Holy Ghost and to see the hand\
of the Lord in our lives.\
8:11\
With the announcement and completions\
of dozens of temples,\
8:15\
we are more frequently entering\
the House of the Lord\
8:19\
and receiving His promised blessings.\
8:22\
We are feeling more powerfully the\
transcendent beauty of our Savior\
8:28\
and Redeemer. President Nelson said,\
8:33\
“There is nothing easy or automatic\
about becoming [a] powerful disciple.\
8:38\
Our focus must be riveted on\
the Savior and His gospel.\
8:43\
It is mentally rigorous to strive to\
look unto Him in every thought.”\
8:51\
By focusing our attention on Jesus\
Christ, all else around us,\
8:56\
while still present, is viewed\
through our love for Him.\
9:01\
Less important distractions fade,\
9:04\
and we remove those things that are\
not in keeping with His light\
9:08\
and character. As you continue to\
attentively catch hold of this thought\
9:14\
of Jesus Christ, trust in Him,\
and keep His commandments,\
9:20\
I promise you not only heavenly guidance\
but heavenly power,\
9:26\
power to bring strength\
to your covenants,\
9:28\
peace to your difficulties, and joy\
to your blessings.\
9:35\
A few weeks ago, Kathy and I visited\
the home of Matt and Sarah Johnson.\
9:41\
On the wall was a picture of\
their precious family,\
9:45\
a beautiful image of the Savior, and\
an illustration of the temple.\
9:50\
Their are four daughters, Maddie, Ruby,\
9:52\
Claire, and June spoke happily about how\
much they loved their mother. For over\
9:58\
a year, Sarah had regularly scheduled\
Saturday appointments for\
10:03\
the family to attend the\
temple together so that\
10:06\
the girls could participate in baptisms\
for family members who lived previously.\
10:12\
In November of last year,\
10:14\
Sarah scheduled a family\
temple appointment for\
10:17\
the last week in December on Thursday\
instead of Saturday.\
10:23\
“I hope you’re okay with that,”\
she said to Matt.\
10:27\
Sarah had been diagnosed with cancer,\
10:30\
but the doctors anticipated she\
would live two or three more years.\
10:36\
During a sacrament meeting, Sarah had\
shared her powerful testimony,\
10:41\
saying that whatever the\
outcome for her,\
10:44\
she loved the Savior with\
all her heart and that\
10:48\
the victory had already been won by Him.\
10:54\
As December progressed, unexpectedly,\
10:58\
Sarah’s health rapidly declined, and she\
was admitted to the hospital. In\
11:04\
the early morning of Thursday,\
December 29th,\
11:08\
she quietly completed her mortality.\
11:12\
Matt had been by Sarah's\
side all through\
11:15\
the night. With his heart breaking\
and completely exhausted,\
11:19\
physically and emotionally, he arrived\
home, sorrowing with his daughters.\
11:25\
As Matt glanced at his phone,\
11:28\
he noticed the reminder of\
11:30\
the unusual Thursday temple appointment\
Sarah had scheduled\
11:34\
for later that day. Matt said, “When\
I first saw it, I thought,\
11:38\
this just isn’t going to work.”\
11:41\
But then Matt’s mind caught hold upon\
the thought, “The Savior lives.\
11:47\
There is no place we would rather be\
as a family than in His holy house.”\
11:52\
Matt, Matty, Ruby, Claire, and June\
arrived at the temple for\
11:58\
the appointment Sarah had\
scheduled for them.\
12:02\
With tears streaming down his cheeks,\
12:05\
Matt performed the baptisms\
with his daughters.\
12:09\
They deeply felt their love and\
eternal bond with Sarah,\
12:14\
and they felt the immense love and\
comforting peace of the Savior.\
12:19\
Matt tenderly shared, “While I\
feel deep sorrow and grief,\
12:26\
I am shouting for joy, knowing my\
Father’s wonderful plan of salvation.”\
12:34\
In this Easter season, I witness the\
complete and absolute truth of\
12:42\
the Savior’s incomparable\
12:43\
atoning sacrifice and of His\
glorious Resurrection.\
12:49\
As your mind remains firmly\
and forever upon\
12:52\
the thought of Jesus Christ,\
12:55\
and as you continue to focus your\
life more fully on the Savior,\
13:00\
I promise you that you will feel His\
hope, His peace, and His love.\
13:07\
In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen\
