As a young boy, I learned to love the\
dramatic changes in the seasons of\
0:06\
the year in southwest Montana,\
where I grew up.\
0:09\
My favorite season was the fall—\
the time of the harvest.\
0:14\
Our family hoped and prayed that our\
months of hard work would be rewarded\
0:18\
with a bountiful harvest.\
0:20\
My parents worried over the weather,\
0:22\
the health of animals and crops,\
0:24\
and many other things over which\
they had little control.\
0:28\
As I grew, I became even more aware\
of the urgency involved.\
0:32\
Our livelihood depended\
upon the harvest.\
0:35\
My father taught me about the equipment\
we used to harvest grain.\
0:39\
I watched as he would move the\
machinery into the field,\
0:42\
cut a small swath of grain,\
0:44\
and then check behind the combine\
to make sure that as much grain\
0:47\
as possible landed in the holding tank\
and was not thrown out with the chaff.\
0:53\
He repeated this exercise several times,\
adjusting the machine each time.\
0:59\
I ran alongside and pawed through the\
chaff with him and pretended like\
1:03\
I knew what I was doing. After he was\
satisfied with the adjustments to\
1:08\
the machine, I found some kernels of\
grain in the chaff on the ground\
1:13\
and presented them to him\
with a critical look.\
1:16\
I will not forget what\
my father said to me.\
1:19\
“It is good enough and the best that\
this machine can do.” Not really\
1:25\
satisfied with his explanation,\
1:27\
I pondered the imperfections\
of this harvest.\
1:31\
A short time later, when the weather\
turned cold in the evenings,\
1:34\
I watched thousands of migrating swan,\
geese, and ducks descend onto\
1:38\
the fields to nourish themselves\
on their long journey south.\
1:43\
They ate the leftover grain from\
our imperfect harvest.\
1:47\
God had perfected it and\
not a kernel was lost.\
1:52\
It is often a temptation in our world\
and even within the culture of\
1:55\
the Church, to obsess about perfection.\
1:58\
Social media, unrealistic expectations,\
2:02\
and often our own self-criticism create\
feelings of inadequacy—that we are\
2:07\
not good enough and never will be.\
2:10\
Some even misunderstand the invitation\
of the Savior to “be ye\
2:14\
therefore perfect.” Remember that\
perfectionism is not the same\
2:19\
as being perfected in Christ.\
2:22\
Perfectionism requires an impossible,\
2:25\
self-inflicted standard that\
compares us to others.\
2:28\
This causes guilt, anxiety, and can\
make us want to isolate ourselves\
2:35\
and withdraw. Becoming perfected\
in Christ is another matter.\
2:41\
It is the process—lovingly\
guided by the Holy Ghost—\
2:44\
of becoming more like the Savior.\
2:47\
The standards are set by\
a kind and all-knowing\
2:50\
Heavenly Father and clearly defined in\
the covenants we are invited to embrace.\
2:56\
It relieves us of the burdens\
of guilt and inadequacy,\
3:00\
always emphasizing who we\
are in the sight of God.\
3:05\
While this process lifts us and\
pushes us to become better,\
3:08\
we are measured by our personal devotion\
to God that we manifest in our\
3:13\
efforts to follow Him in faith.\
3:17\
As we accept the Savior’s invitation\
to come unto Him,\
3:20\
we soon realize that our best is good\
enough and that the grace of\
3:25\
a loving Savior will make up\
3:26\
the difference in ways\
we cannot imagine.\
3:29\
We can see this principle in effect,\
when the Savior fed the 5000.\
3:34\
“When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and\
saw a great company come unto him,\
3:39\
he saith unto Philip, Whence shall\
we buy bread that these may eat?\
3:44\
Philip answered him, two hundred\
pennyworth of bread is not sufficient\
3:48\
for them, that every one of\
them may take a little.\
3:51\
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon\
Peter’s brother, saith unto him,\
3:56\
There is a lad here which hath five\
barley loaves, and two small fishes;\
4:01\
but what are they among so many?”\
4:04\
Do you ever wonder how the Savior must\
have felt about this young boy who,\
4:08\
with the faith of a child,\
4:09\
offered what he must have known to be\
woefully inadequate in the face of\
4:13\
the task at hand? “And Jesus took the\
loaves; and when he had given thanks,\
4:18\
he distributed to the disciples, and the\
4:21\
disciples to them that were set down;\
and likewise of the fishes,\
4:25\
as much as they would. When\
they were filled,\
4:28\
he said unto his disciples,\
4:30\
Gather up the fragments that remain,\
that nothing be lost.”\
4:34\
The Savior perfected the\
humble offering.\
4:38\
Shortly after this experience, Jesus\
sent His disciples ahead on a boat.\
4:42\
They soon found themselves on a stormy\
sea in the middle of the night.\
4:46\
They became frightened when they saw a\
ghostly figure walking toward them\
4:50\
on the water. “But straightway Jesus\
spake unto them, saying,\
4:55\
Be of good cheer; it is I;\
be not afraid.\
4:59\
And Peter answered him and said, Lord,\
if it be thou, bid me\
5:04\
come unto thee on the water.\
And he said, Come.\
5:08\
And when Peter was come\
down out of the ship,\
5:11\
he walked on the water to go to Jesus.\
5:14\
But when he saw the wind boisterous, he\
was afraid; and beginning to sink,\
5:19\
he cried, saying, Lord, save me.\
5:23\
And immediately Jesus stretched\
forth his hand, and caught him,\
5:26\
and said unto him, O thou of little\
faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?”\
5:32\
Brothers and sisters, that may not have\
been the end of the conversation.\
5:36\
I believe that as Peter and the Savior\
walked back to the ship, arm in arm,\
5:41\
Peter soaking wet and perhaps\
feeling very foolish,\
5:44\
the Savior may have said something\
like this: “Oh, Peter, fear not\
5:50\
and worry not. If you could\
see yourself as I see you,\
5:55\
your doubt would fade and\
your faith increase.\
5:58\
I love you, dear Peter, You got out of\
the boat. Your offering is acceptable,\
6:04\
and even though you faltered,\
6:06\
I will always be there to lift\
you from the depths,\
6:09\
and your offering will be made perfect.”\
6:12\
Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught,\
6:14\
“I believe the Savior Jesus Christ\
would want you to see,\
6:18\
feel, and know that He is your strength.\
6:21\
That with His help, there are no limits\
to what you can accomplish.\
6:25\
That your potential is limitless.\
6:28\
He would want you to see yourself\
the way He sees you.\
6:31\
And that is very different from\
the way the world sees you.”\
6:35\
“He gives power to the weary; and\
to those who feel powerless,\
6:39\
He increases strength.” We must\
remember that whatever our best\
6:45\
but imperfect offering is, the\
Savior can make it perfect.\
6:48\
No matter how insignificant\
our efforts may seem,\
6:52\
we must never underestimate\
the Savior’s power.\
6:56\
A simple word of kindness, a brief\
but sincere ministering visit,\
7:01\
a Primary lesson lovingly taught can,\
with the Savior’s help, comfort,\
7:06\
soften hearts, and change eternal lives.\
Our clumsy efforts can lead to miracles,\
7:13\
and in the process, we can participate\
in a perfect harvest.\
7:18\
Often we are placed in situations\
that will cause us to stretch.\
7:22\
We may not feel up to the task.\
7:25\
We may look at those we serve with and\
feel that we will never measure up.\
7:30\
Brothers and sisters, if\
you feel that way,\
7:33\
look at the extraordinary men and\
women seated behind me whom\
7:36\
I serve with. I feel your pain.\
7:42\
I have learned, however, that just\
as perfectionism is not the same\
7:46\
as being perfected in Christ,\
7:48\
self comparison is not the\
same as emulation.\
7:52\
When we compare ourselves to others,\
there can only be two results.\
7:57\
Either we will see ourselves as better\
than others and become judgmental\
8:01\
and critical of them, or we will see\
ourselves as less than others\
8:05\
and become anxious, self-critical,\
and discouraged.\
8:10\
Comparing ourselves to others is rarely\
productive, not uplifting,\
8:14\
and sometimes downright depressing.\
8:18\
In fact, these comparisons can\
be spiritually destructive,\
8:22\
preventing us from receiving\
the spiritual help we need.\
8:26\
On the other hand, emulating\
those who we respect,\
8:31\
who demonstrate Christlike attributes,\
can be instructive, uplifting,\
8:36\
and can help us become better\
disciples of Jesus Christ.\
8:40\
The Savior gave us a model to follow\
8:42\
as He emulated the Father. He\
instructed His disciple\
8:46\
Philip: “Have I been so long time with\
you, and yet hast thou not known me ...?\
8:52\
he that hath seen me, hath\
seen the Father;\
8:55\
and how sayest thou then, Shew us the\
Father?” And then He taught, “Verily,\
9:00\
verily, I say unto you, He that\
believeth on me, the works that I do\
9:05\
shall he do also.” Regardless of how\
insignificant our efforts may seem,\
9:10\
if we are sincere, the Savior will\
use us to accomplish His work.\
9:15\
If we simply do the best we can\
and trust Him to make up\
9:19\
the difference, we can become part\
of the miracles that surround us.\
9:23\
Elder Dale G. Renlund said, “You\
don’t have to be perfect,\
9:28\
but we need you, because everybody\
who’s willing can do something.”\
9:33\
And President Nelson teaches\
us, “The Lord loves effort.”\
9:38\
The Savior stands ready to accept\
our humble offerings\
9:41\
and perfect them through His grace.\
9:44\
With Christ, there is no\
imperfect harvest.\
9:47\
We must have the courage to believe\
that His grace is for us,\
9:50\
that He will help us, rescue us from\
the depths when we falter,\
9:55\
and perfect our\
less-than-perfect efforts.\
9:59\
In the parable of the sower,\
10:00\
the Savior describes the seeds that\
are planted in good ground.\
10:04\
Some produce a hundredfold,\
some 60, and others 30.\
10:08\
All are part of His perfect harvest.\
10:11\
The prophet Moroni invited all, “Yea,\
come unto Christ, and be perfected in\
10:15\
him ... and if ye shall deny yourselves\
of all ungodliness,\
10:18\
and love God with all your\
might, mind, and strength,\
10:21\
then his grace is sufficient\
for you, that by his grace\
10:25\
ye may be perfect in Christ.”\
10:28\
Brothers and sisters, I testify\
of Christ who has\
10:31\
the power to perfect even our\
most humble offering.\
10:34\
Let us do our best, bring what\
we can, and, with faith,\
10:38\
lay our imperfect offering at His feet.\
10:41\
In the name of He who is the Master of\
the perfect harvest, even Jesus Christ,\
10:46\
amen.\
