“Now, what do we hear in the gospel\
which we have received?\
0:05\
A voice of gladness! A voice\
of mercy from heaven; and\
0:10\
a voice of truth out of the earth; ...\
0:13\
[glad tidings] for [both] the living and\
the dead; glad tidings of great joy.”\
0:21\
Brothers and sisters, it is almost\
impossible to hear these words from\
0:25\
the Prophet Joseph Smith and not break\
out into a great big smile.\
0:30\
Joseph’s jubilant expression\
truly captures the full\
0:35\
and majestic joy found in God,\
0:38\
our Heavenly Father’s, great\
plan of happiness.\
0:41\
For as He has assured us, “Men are,\
that they might have joy.”\
0:47\
We all shouted for joy in our premortal\
life when we heard God's plan of\
0:52\
happiness. And we continue\
to shout for joy here\
0:56\
as we live according to His plan.\
0:59\
But what exactly was the context\
for this happy declaration from\
1:04\
the Prophet? What spurred these\
deep and heartfelt emotions?\
1:10\
The Prophet Joseph had been teaching\
about baptism for the dead.\
1:15\
This was indeed a glorious revelation\
that was received with great joy. When\
1:22\
Church members first learned\
that they could be baptized\
1:25\
for their deceased loved ones,\
they rejoiced.\
1:28\
Wilford Woodruff said, “The moment I\
heard of it, my soul leaped for joy.”\
1:34\
Baptisms for our deceased loved\
ones wasn't the only truth\
1:38\
the Lord would reveal and restore.\
1:40\
There were a host of other gifts,\
1:42\
or endowments, that God had been eager\
to bestow upon His sons and daughters.\
1:48\
These other gifts included priesthood\
authority, covenants and ordinances,\
1:54\
marriages that could last forever,\
1:57\
the sealing of children to their parents\
within the family of God,\
2:02\
and ultimately the blessing of returning\
home to the presence of God,\
2:07\
our Heavenly Father, and\
His Son, Jesus Christ.\
2:12\
All these blessings were made possible\
through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
2:19\
Because God considered these to be among\
His highest and holiest blessings,\
2:23\
He instructed that sacred buildings be\
erected where He could confer these\
2:28\
precious gifts upon His children. These\
buildings would be His home on Earth.\
2:35\
These buildings would be temples where\
that which was sealed or bound\
2:39\
on earth in His name and by His word\
2:43\
and with His authority would\
be bound in the heavens.\
2:48\
As members of the Church today,\
2:50\
it could become easy for some of\
us to take these glorious,\
2:54\
eternal truths for granted. They've\
become second nature to us.\
2:59\
Sometimes it is helpful when\
we see them through\
3:02\
the eyes of those who learn about\
them for the very first time.\
3:08\
This became evident to me through\
a recent experience. Last year,\
3:13\
just prior to the rededication\
of the Tokyo Japan Temple,\
3:17\
many guests not of our faith\
toured that temple.\
3:21\
One such tour included a thoughtful\
leader from another religion.\
3:26\
We taught our friend about Heavenly\
Father's plan of happiness,\
3:30\
Jesus Christ's redeeming\
role in that plan,\
3:33\
and the doctrine that the family\
can be united eternally through\
3:38\
the sealing ordinance. At the\
conclusion of the tour,\
3:43\
I invited our friend to share\
his feelings. In reference to\
3:47\
the uniting of families both past,\
present and future,\
3:51\
this good man asked, in all sincerity,\
3:54\
“Do the members of your faith truly\
understand just how profound this\
3:59\
doctrine is?” He added,\
“This may well be one of\
4:03\
the only teachings that can unite\
this world that is so divided.”\
4:08\
What a powerful observation.\
4:11\
This man was not moved simply by\
the exquisite craftsmanship of\
4:15\
the temple, but rather by the stunning\
4:18\
and profound doctrine that\
families are united\
4:21\
and sealed to Heavenly Father\
and Jesus Christ forever.\
4:26\
We should not be surprised, then,\
4:28\
when even someone not of\
our faith recognizes\
4:32\
the majesty of what happens\
in the temple.\
4:35\
What could become common or routine\
4:37\
for us is sometimes seen\
in its splendor\
4:40\
and majesty by those who hear it or\
feel it for the very first time.\
4:47\
Although temples had existed anciently,\
with the restoration of\
4:51\
the Gospel of Jesus Christ,\
4:53\
the building of temples has been one of\
4:56\
the highest priorities of all prophets\
since the Prophet Joseph Smith.\
5:01\
And is easy to understand why.\
5:04\
When the Prophet Joseph was teaching\
about baptism for the dead,\
5:08\
he revealed another great\
truth. He taught,\
5:11\
“Let me assure you that these are\
principles in relation to the dead\
5:16\
and the living that cannot\
be lightly passed over,\
5:19\
as pertaining to our salvation.\
5:22\
For their salvation is necessary\
and essential to our salvation, ...\
5:27\
they without us cannot\
be made perfect—\
5:30\
neither can we without our\
dead be made perfect.”\
5:35\
As we can see, the need for temples\
and the work that is done for both\
5:39\
the living and the dead becomes very\
clear. The adversary is on the alert.\
5:45\
His power is threatened\
by the ordinances\
5:48\
and covenants performed in temples,\
5:50\
and he does anything he can to\
try to stop the work. Why?\
5:55\
Because he knows of the power that\
comes from this sacred work.\
6:00\
As each temple is dedicated,\
6:03\
the saving power of Jesus Christ\
expands throughout\
6:07\
the world to counteract the efforts\
of the adversary and to redeem us\
6:13\
as we come unto Him. As temples and\
covenant keepers grow in number,\
6:20\
the adversary grows weaker.\
6:23\
In the early days of the Church,\
6:24\
some would worry when a new temple would\
be announced, for they would say,\
6:28\
“We never began to build\
a temple without\
6:30\
the bells of hell starting to ring.”\
6:33\
But Brigham Young courageously retorted,\
“I want to hear them ring again.”\
6:39\
In this mortal life, we will\
never escape the war,\
6:43\
but we can have power over the enemy.\
6:46\
That power and strength come from\
Jesus Christ as we make\
6:50\
and keep temple covenants.\
6:53\
President Russell M. Nelson has taught,\
6:55\
“The time is coming when\
those who do not obey\
6:58\
the Lord will be separated\
from those who do.\
7:01\
Our safest insurance is to continue to\
be worthy of admission to His holy\
7:07\
house.” Here are some additional\
blessings\
7:10\
God has promised us through His prophet.\
Do you need miracles?\
7:15\
Our prophet has said, “I promise\
you that the Lord will bring\
7:19\
the miracles He knows you need as\
you make sacrifices to serve\
7:23\
and worship in His temples.”\
7:26\
Do you need the healing and\
strengthening power of our Savior,\
7:30\
Jesus Christ? President Nelson\
reassures us that “everything taught in\
7:35\
the temple increases our understanding\
of Jesus Christ.\
7:40\
As we continue to keep our covenants,\
He endows us with His healing,\
7:45\
strengthening power, and oh, how we will\
need his power in the days ahead.”\
7:52\
On that first Palm Sunday, as Jesus\
Christ triumphantly entered Jerusalem,\
7:57\
a multitude of the disciples of Jesus\
Christ praised God with a loud voice,\
8:03\
saying, “Blessed be the king that\
cometh in the name of the Lord.”\
8:08\
How fitting that on Palm Sunday of 1836,\
8:12\
the Kirtland Temple was being\
dedicated. On that occasion,\
8:17\
the disciples of Jesus Christ\
were rejoicing as well.\
8:21\
In that dedicatory prayer,\
8:23\
the Prophet Joseph Smith declared these\
words of praise. “O Lord God Almighty,\
8:29\
hear us ... and answer us from Heaven,\
... where thou sits enthroned, with\
8:34\
glory, honor, power,\
majesty, [and] might. ...\
8:38\
Help us that by the power of thy Spirit,\
8:41\
that we may mingle our voices with those\
bright, shining seraphs around thy\
8:46\
throne, with acclamations of praise,\
8:49\
singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb! And\
let these, ... thy saints shout aloud\
8:55\
for joy.” Brothers and sisters\
today on this Palm Sunday,\
9:01\
let us as disciples of Jesus Christ also\
praise our Holy God and rejoice in\
9:08\
His goodness to us. What do we hear in\
the Gospel which we have received? Truly\
9:15\
a voice of gladness. I witness that\
you will feel joy more and more\
9:21\
as you enter the holy\
temples of the Lord.\
9:23\
And I witness that you will experience\
the joy He in turn, has for you.\
9:28\
In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\
