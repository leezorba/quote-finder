Last November, I had the privilege of\
dedicating the Belém Brazil Temple.\
0:07\
It was a joy to be with the\
consecrated members of\
0:10\
the Church in northern Brazil.\
At that time,\
0:14\
I learned that Belém is the gateway\
to the region that includes\
0:18\
the most powerful river in the world,\
the Amazon River.\
0:22\
Despite the river’s strength,\
twice a year\
0:26\
something seemingly unnatural\
happens when the sun,\
0:31\
moon, and earth are aligned just so,\
0:35\
a powerful tidal wave flows up the\
river against the natural flow of\
0:40\
the water. Waves up to six meters high\
0:44\
traveling as far as 50km upstream\
have been documented.\
0:49\
This phenomenon, known generally\
as a tidal bore,\
0:54\
is referred to locally as “pororoca,”\
or “great roar” because of\
0:59\
the loud noise it makes. We can\
correctly conclude that even\
1:04\
the mighty Amazon must yield to heavenly\
powers. Like the Amazon,\
1:12\
we have a natural flow to our lives.\
We tend to do what comes naturally.\
1:18\
Like the Amazon, with heavenly help, we\
can do seemingly unnatural things.\
1:26\
After all, it's not natural\
for us to be humble, meek,\
1:30\
or willing to submit our wills to God.\
1:33\
Yet only by doing so can\
we be transformed,\
1:37\
return to live in the presence of God,\
and achieve our eternal destiny.\
1:43\
Unlike the Amazon, we can choose whether\
we yield to heavenly powers\
1:48\
or go with the flow. Going against\
the flow may be difficult,\
1:54\
but when we yield to the enticings\
of the Holy Spirit and put off\
1:59\
the selfish tendencies of the\
natural man or woman,\
2:02\
we can receive the Savior’s transforming\
power in our lives,\
2:07\
the power to do difficult things.\
2:11\
President Russell M. Nelson\
taught us how to do this.\
2:14\
He promised, “Each person who makes\
covenants in baptismal fonts\
2:19\
and in temples—and keeps them—\
has increased access to\
2:24\
the power of Jesus Christ ... to lift us\
above the pull of this fallen world.”\
2:30\
In other words, we can access\
the power of God,\
2:34\
but only when we connect with Him\
through sacred covenants.\
2:39\
Before the Earth was created,\
2:41\
God established covenants as the\
mechanism by which we, His children,\
2:47\
could unite ourselves to Him. Based\
on eternal, unchanging law,\
2:53\
He specified the non-negotiable\
conditions whereby we're transformed,\
2:59\
saved, and exalted. In this life\
3:03\
we make these covenants by participating\
in priesthood ordinances\
3:07\
and promising to do what\
God asks us to do.\
3:10\
And in return, God promises\
us certain blessings.\
3:16\
A covenant is a pledge that\
we should prepare for,\
3:20\
clearly understand,\
and absolutely honor.\
3:24\
Making a covenant with God is different\
than casually making a promise.\
3:30\
First, priesthood authority is required.\
3:33\
Second, a feeble promise doesn't have\
3:36\
the connecting strength to lift us above\
the pull of the natural flow.\
3:42\
We make a covenant only when we intend\
to commit ourselves quite exceptionally\
3:47\
to fulfilling it. We become\
covenant children of God\
3:51\
and inheritors of His kingdom,\
3:54\
especially when we identify ourselves\
completely with the covenant.\
4:00\
The term “covenant path” refers to\
4:02\
a series of covenants whereby we come\
to Christ and connect to Him.\
4:09\
Through this covenant bond, we have\
access to His eternal power.\
4:14\
The path begins with faith in\
Jesus Christ and repentance,\
4:18\
followed by baptism and receiving\
the Holy Ghost.\
4:22\
Jesus Christ showed us how to enter\
the path when He was baptized.\
4:27\
According to the New Testament gospel\
accounts in Mark and Luke,\
4:31\
Heavenly Father spoke directly to\
Jesus at His baptism, saying,\
4:37\
“Thou art my beloved Son; in thee\
I am well pleased.”\
4:43\
When we embark on the covenant\
path through baptism,\
4:47\
I can imagine Heavenly Father saying\
a similar thing to each of us:\
4:53\
“Thou art my dear child, in whom I\
delight. Keep going.” At baptism\
5:00\
and when we partake of the sacrament,\
5:02\
we witness that we're willing to take on\
ourselves the name of Jesus Christ.\
5:08\
In this context, let's be mindful of\
5:11\
the Old Testament commandment “Thou\
shalt not take the name of\
5:14\
the Lord thy God in vain.”\
5:16\
To our modern ears, this sounds like\
5:19\
a prohibition against irreverently\
using the Lord's name.\
5:23\
The commandment includes that, but its\
injunction is even more profound.\
5:29\
The Hebrew word translated as “take”\
means “to lift up” or “carry,” as one\
5:36\
would a banner that identifies oneself\
with an individual or group.\
5:41\
The word translated as “vain”\
means “empty” or “deceptive.”\
5:48\
The commandment to not take\
5:49\
the Lord's name in vain can thus mean\
you shouldn't identify yourself as\
5:54\
a disciple of Jesus Christ unless you\
intend to represent Him well.\
6:00\
We become His disciples and represent\
Him well when we intentionally\
6:06\
and incrementally take on ourselves\
6:08\
the name of Jesus Christ\
through covenants.\
6:11\
Our covenants give us power to\
stay on the covenant path\
6:14\
because our relationship with Jesus\
Christ and our Heavenly Father is\
6:19\
changed. We're connected to\
them by a covenantal bond.\
6:25\
The covenant path leads to the\
ordinances of the temple,\
6:28\
such as the temple endowment.\
6:31\
The endowment is God's gift of sacred\
covenants that connect us more fully\
6:36\
to Him. In the endowment we first strive\
to keep the commandments of God—\
6:42\
that’s what we covenant to do;\
6:44\
second, we repent with a broken\
heart and contrite spirit;\
6:48\
third, to live the gospel\
of Jesus Christ.\
6:52\
We do this by exercising faith in Him,\
6:55\
making covenants with God as we receive\
the ordinances of salvation\
6:59\
and exaltation, keeping those\
covenants throughout our lives,\
7:03\
and striving to live the two great\
commandments to love God and neighbor.\
7:09\
We, fourth, covenant to keep\
the law of chastity\
7:13\
and, fifth, to dedicate ourselves and\
everything the Lord blesses us with\
7:18\
to build up His Church. By making\
and keeping temple covenants,\
7:24\
we learn more about the Lord’s purposes\
and receive a fullness of\
7:28\
the Holy Ghost. We receive\
direction for our lives.\
7:32\
We mature in our discipleship so\
that we don't remain perpetual,\
7:36\
unknowing children. Rather,\
7:39\
we live with an eternal perspective and\
are more motivated to serve God\
7:44\
and others. We receive increased\
capacity to fulfill our purposes in\
7:49\
mortality. We're protected from evil\
7:53\
and gain greater power to resist\
temptation and to repent\
7:58\
when we stumble. When we falter,\
8:01\
the memory of our covenants with\
God helps us return to\
8:05\
the path. By connecting to God’s power,\
8:09\
we become our own “pororoca,” able\
to go against the flow of\
8:14\
the world throughout our lives\
and into the eternities.\
8:19\
Ultimately, our destinies\
are changed because\
8:22\
the covenant path leads to exaltation\
and eternal life.\
8:28\
Keeping covenants in baptismal fonts\
8:30\
and in temples also provides us with\
strength to withstand mortality's\
8:35\
trials and heartaches. The doctrine\
associated with these covenants eases\
8:41\
our way and provides hope,\
comfort, and peace.\
8:47\
My grandparents, Lena Sofia and Matts\
8:50\
Leander Renlund, received God’s power\
through their baptismal covenant when\
8:55\
they joined the Church\
in 1912 in Finland.\
8:59\
They were happy to be part\
of the first branch of\
9:02\
the Church in Finland. Leander died from\
tuberculosis five years later when\
9:08\
Lena was pregnant with their\
tenth child. That child,\
9:13\
my father, was born two months\
after Leander’s death.\
9:18\
Lena eventually buried\
not just her husband,\
9:21\
but also seven of her ten children.\
As an impoverished widow,\
9:27\
she struggled. For 20 years\
9:29\
she didn’t get a good night’s\
rest. During the day,\
9:32\
she scrambled to provide\
food for her family.\
9:36\
At night, she took care of\
dying family members.\
9:40\
It's hard to imagine how she coped.\
9:44\
Lena persevered because she knew\
that her deceased husband\
9:49\
and children could be hers\
through the eternities.\
9:53\
The doctrine of temple blessings,\
including that of eternal families,\
9:58\
brought her peace because she trusted\
in the sealing power.\
10:03\
While in mortality, she neither\
received her endowment\
10:07\
nor was she sealed to Leander.\
10:09\
But Leander remained a vital influence\
in her life and part of her great hope\
10:14\
for the future. In 1938,\
Lena submitted records\
10:19\
so that temple ordinances\
could be performed\
10:21\
for her deceased family members,\
10:23\
some of the earliest submitted\
from Finland. After she died,\
10:29\
temple ordinances were performed\
by others for her,\
10:33\
Leander, and her deceased children.\
By proxy, she was endowed,\
10:39\
Lena and Leander were sealed to each\
other and their deceased children,\
10:44\
and my father was sealed to them.\
10:49\
Like others, Lena “died in faith, not\
having received the promises,\
10:55\
but having seen them afar off, ... [was]\
persuaded of them and embraced them.”\
11:02\
Lena lived as though she had already\
made these covenants in her life.\
11:07\
She knew that her baptismal\
11:09\
and sacramental covenants connected\
her to the Savior.\
11:13\
She “let the sweet longing for\
11:15\
[the Redeemer’s] holy place bring\
hope to her desolate heart.”\
11:21\
Lena considered it one of God's great\
mercies that she learned about eternal\
11:26\
families before experiencing\
11:28\
the tragedies in her life.\
Through covenant,\
11:32\
she received the power of God\
to endure and rise above\
11:37\
the depressive pull of the challenges\
and hardships she had.\
11:43\
As you walk the covenant path\
from baptism to the temple\
11:47\
and throughout life, I promise\
you power to go against\
11:52\
the natural worldly flow—\
power to learn,\
11:56\
power to repent and be sanctified,\
11:59\
and power to find hope,\
comfort, and even joy\
12:05\
as you face life's challenges.\
12:08\
I promise you and your family protection\
against the influence of\
12:12\
the adversary, especially when you make\
the temple a major focus in your life.\
12:20\
As you come to Christ and\
are connected to Him\
12:23\
and our Heavenly Father by covenant,\
something seemingly unnatural happens.\
12:29\
You're transformed and become\
perfected in Jesus Christ.\
12:34\
You become a covenant child of God\
and an inheritor in His kingdom.\
12:40\
I can imagine him saying to you, “Thou\
art my dear child, in whom I delight.\
12:49\
Welcome home.” In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
