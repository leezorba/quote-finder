Today, as has been said,\
0:05\
we join with Christians around the\
world to honor Jesus Christ\
0:09\
on this Palm Sunday. Nearly\
2000 years ago,\
0:14\
Palm Sunday marked the beginning\
of the last week of\
0:17\
the mortal ministry of Jesus Christ.\
0:20\
It was the most important\
week in human history.\
0:24\
What began with the heralding\
of Jesus as\
0:27\
the promised Messiah in His triumphant\
entry into Jerusalem,\
0:32\
closed with His Crucifixion\
and Resurrection.\
0:36\
By divine design, His atoning sacrifice\
concluded His mortal ministry,\
0:43\
making it possible for us to live with\
our Heavenly Father for eternity.\
0:49\
Scriptures tell us that the week\
began with throngs standing at\
0:54\
the gates of the city to see “Jesus the\
prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.”\
1:01\
They “took branches of palm trees, and\
went forth to meet him, and cried,\
1:07\
Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel\
that cometh in the name of the Lord.”\
1:13\
That biblical account of so long\
ago reminds me of being on\
1:19\
a Church assignment in Takoradi, Ghana.\
Remarkably, I was there on Palm Sunday.\
1:26\
I was to divide the Takoradi Ghana Stake\
to create the Mpinstsin Ghana stake.\
1:33\
Today, there are over 100,000 members\
of the Church in Ghana.\
1:41\
We welcome his majesty, King Mahn\
Gahman Quaye of Accra, Ghana,\
1:48\
who is here with us today. Welcome,\
your majesty.\
1:53\
Meeting with these saints,\
1:54\
I felt their profound love\
and devotion to the Lord.\
1:59\
I expressed my great love for them\
and that the President of\
2:03\
the Church loved them. I referred to\
2:06\
the Savior’s words recorded by John:\
“That ye love one another as\
2:12\
I have loved you.” They deemed it\
the “I love you conference.”\
2:18\
As I looked up and down the rows of\
those dear brothers and sisters\
2:22\
and their families in the chapel,\
2:25\
I could see in their faces the glow of\
testimony and faith in Jesus Christ.\
2:32\
I felt their desire to be counted as\
part of His far-reaching Church.\
2:37\
And when the choir sang, they sang like\
angels. Like on Palm Sunday of old,\
2:47\
these were disciples of Jesus Christ\
gathered to pay tribute to Him,\
2:53\
as did those at the gates of Jerusalem,\
who, with palms in their hands,\
2:58\
exclaimed, “Hosanna ... Blessed is he\
that cometh in the name of the Lord.”\
3:05\
Even the parishioners in a church nearby\
were honoring Palm Sunday.\
3:10\
As I was speaking from the pulpit,\
3:12\
I noticed out the window they were\
joyfully walking down the street,\
3:17\
waving palms in their hands, much\
like those in this photo.\
3:22\
It was a sight I will never forget—\
3:25\
all of us that day worshiping\
the King of Kings.\
3:30\
President Russell M. Nelson has\
admonished us to make Palm Sunday,\
3:36\
quote, “truly holy by remembering not\
just the palms that were waved to honor\
3:42\
the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem,\
3:46\
but by remembering the\
palms of His hands.”\
3:51\
Then President Nelson referred to\
Isaiah, who spoke of the Savior’s\
3:56\
promising, “I will never forget you,”\
3:59\
with these words: “Behold, I have graven\
thee upon the palms of my hands.”\
4:08\
The Lord knows first hand\
that mortality is hard.\
4:12\
His wounds remind us that He “descended\
below ... all” that He might succor us\
4:17\
when we suffer and be our example\
“to hold on thy way,”\
4:21\
His way, that “God shall be with\
[us] forever and ever.”\
4:27\
Palm Sunday was not just an event,\
4:30\
another page in history with a date,\
time, and place. Jesus Christ’s\
4:36\
triumphant entry into Jerusalem\
and the events of\
4:40\
the week that followed exemplified\
doctrine we can apply in our lives\
4:45\
today. Let us look at some of\
4:48\
the eternal doctrine that weaves through\
His ministry concluding in Jerusalem.\
4:55\
First prophecy. For example,\
4:59\
Old Testament prophet Zechariah\
prophesied of Jesus Christ’s triumphal\
5:05\
entry into Jerusalem, even describing\
He would ride on a donkey.\
5:11\
Jesus foretold His Resurrection as He\
prepared to enter the city, saying,\
5:17\
“Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the\
Son of man shall be betrayed unto\
5:23\
the chief priests and unto the scribes,\
5:26\
and they shall condemn him to death. And\
shall deliver him to the Gentiles\
5:31\
to mock, and to scourge,\
and to crucify him:\
5:35\
and the third day, he shall rise again.”\
5:39\
Second, the companionship of the Holy\
Ghost. Joseph Smith taught,\
5:45\
“No man can know that Jesus is the Lord,\
5:48\
but by the Holy Ghost.” The Savior\
promised His disciples at\
5:53\
the Last Supper in the upper room, “I\
will not leave you comfortless.”\
5:59\
They would not be alone to carry the\
truths of the gospel forward,\
6:03\
but would have the consummate gift of\
the Holy Ghost to guide them. “Peace\
6:09\
I leave with you, my peace I\
give unto you,” He promised.\
6:13\
“Not as the world giveth, give I unto\
you.” With the gift of the Holy Ghost,\
6:19\
we have that same assurance—that we “may\
always have his spirit to be with [us],”\
6:26\
and “by the power of the Holy Ghost\
[we] may know the truth of all things.”\
6:33\
Third discipleship. True discipleship\
is unfailing commitment,\
6:39\
obedience to eternal laws,\
and love of God\
6:43\
first and foremost, nothing wavering.\
6:47\
The multitude who paid tribute with\
palms hailed Him as the Messiah.\
6:53\
That was exactly who He was.\
6:56\
They were drawn to Him, His miracles,\
and His teachings.\
7:00\
But the adulation for many did not last.\
Some who earlier had shouted “Hosanna”\
7:08\
soon turned and cried, “Crucify Him.”\
Fourth, the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
7:16\
In His final days following Palm Sunday,\
7:20\
He carried out His remarkable Atonement\
from the agony of Gethsemane to\
7:25\
the mockery of His trial, His\
torture on the cross,\
7:29\
and His burial in a borrowed tomb.\
7:33\
But it did not stop there. With\
the majesty of His calling as\
7:37\
the Redeemer of all of Heavenly\
Father’s children,\
7:41\
three days later, He stepped\
forth from that tomb,\
7:45\
resurrected as He had prophesied.\
7:50\
Are we continually grateful for\
7:52\
the incomparable Atonement\
of Jesus Christ?\
7:56\
Do we feel its purifying\
power right now?\
8:00\
That is why Jesus Christ, the Author\
and Finisher of our Salvation,\
8:06\
went to Jerusalem—to save us all. Do\
these words in Alma strike a chord?\
8:14\
“If ye have experienced\
a change of heart,\
8:17\
and if ye have felt to sing the song\
of redeeming love, I would ask,\
8:22\
can ye feel so now?” I can truly say the\
choir in Takoradi that Palm Sunday\
8:31\
sang “the song of redeeming love.”\
8:35\
That last fateful week of\
His mortal ministry,\
8:39\
Jesus Christ gave the parable\
of the ten virgins.\
8:42\
He was teaching of His return to\
those prepared to receive Him,\
8:47\
not with palms in their hands,\
8:49\
but with the light of the\
gospel within them.\
8:53\
He used the image of lamps lit and\
burning with extra oil to fuel\
8:59\
the flame as a description of\
willingness to live His ways,\
9:04\
His truths, and share His light.\
You know the story.\
9:08\
The ten virgins represent members\
of the Church and\
9:12\
the bridegroom represents Jesus Christ.\
9:15\
The ten virgins took their lamps and\
“went forth to meet the bridegroom.”\
9:20\
Five were wise, prepared with oil in\
their lamps and some to spare,\
9:25\
and five were foolish, lamps dark\
with no oil in reserve.\
9:30\
When the call came, “Behold,\
the bridegroom cometh;\
9:34\
go ye out to meet him,” the five who\
were wise “and [had] received the truth\
9:40\
and [had] taken the Holy Spirit\
for their guide,”\
9:43\
were ready for “their king\
and their lawgiver,”\
9:47\
that “his [glory] would be upon them.”\
9:51\
The other five? Frantically trying to\
find oil. But it was too late.\
9:57\
The procession went forward without\
them. When they knocked and pleaded\
10:01\
for entrance, the Lord responded,\
“I know you not.”\
10:06\
How would we feel if He said\
to us, “I know you not”?\
10:11\
We, like the ten virgins, have lamps,\
but do we have oil?\
10:16\
I fear there are some who are just\
getting by on a thin skiff of oil,\
10:21\
too busy with worldly pressures\
to properly prepare.\
10:26\
Oil comes from believing and\
acting on prophecy and\
10:31\
the words of living prophets, President\
Nelson in particular,\
10:35\
his counselors, and the Twelve Apostles.\
10:38\
Oil fills our souls when we hear\
and feel the Holy Ghost and act\
10:44\
on that divine guidance. Oil pours into\
our hearts when our choices show we\
10:50\
love the Lord,\
and we love what He loves.\
10:54\
Oil comes from repenting and\
seeking the healing of\
10:58\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
11:01\
If some of you are looking to fill what\
some call a “bucket list,” this is it.\
11:09\
Fill your bucket with oil in the form\
of the living water of Jesus Christ,\
11:15\
which is a representation of\
His life and teachings.\
11:19\
In contrast, checking\
off a far-off place\
11:22\
or spectacular event will never leave\
your soul feeling whole or satisfied.\
11:29\
Living the doctrine taught\
by Jesus Christ will.\
11:33\
I mentioned them earlier: embrace\
prophecy and prophetic teachings,\
11:38\
act on promptings of the Holy Ghost,\
11:41\
become a true disciple, and seek\
11:44\
the healing power of our\
Lord’s Atonement.\
11:48\
That bucket list will\
take you somewhere\
11:51\
you want to go—back to your\
Father in Heaven.\
11:55\
That Palm Sunday in Takoradi was a\
very special experience for me\
12:00\
because I shared it with a faithful\
congregation of brothers and sisters.\
12:05\
So it has been on continents and\
islands all around the world.\
12:09\
My heart and soul, like yours, longs to\
shout, “Hosanna to the most High God.”\
12:17\
Though we do not stand at the gates of\
Jerusalem today with palms in our hands,\
12:22\
the time will come when, as\
prophesied in Revelation,\
12:26\
“A great multitude, which no man could\
number, of all nations, and kindreds,\
12:31\
and people, and tongues [will stand]\
before the throne, and before\
12:36\
the Lamb, clothed with white robes,\
and palms in their hands.”\
12:42\
I leave you with my blessing\
12:44\
as an apostle of Jesus Christ\
12:47\
that you will diligently strive\
to live righteously\
12:50\
and be among those with palms in\
their hands, will herald the Son of God,\
12:57\
the Great Redeemer of us all. In the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
