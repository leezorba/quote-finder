Moroni promises that if we read the\
Book of Mormon and then ask God\
0:06\
the Eternal Father, with a sincere\
heart, with real intent,\
0:10\
having faith in Christ, if it is true,\
0:13\
God will manifest its truth by\
the power of the Holy Ghost.\
0:17\
Millions of people have applied\
this promise and received\
0:21\
an assuring witness of the restoration\
of the fullness of\
0:25\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
0:28\
Moroni exhorts us as we read the Book of\
Mormon to “remember how merciful\
0:33\
the Lord hath been unto the children\
of men from the creation of Adam,\
0:38\
even down until [this] time, ... and\
to ponder it in [our] hearts.”\
0:43\
The stories and teachings in the Book\
of Mormon remind us and testify of\
0:48\
the Savior’s love, compassion,\
and mercy.\
0:53\
My father passed away in April 2013.\
0:57\
As I prepared to speak at his funeral,\
1:00\
I realized how blessed I was to know\
and love his favorite scriptures.\
1:06\
He shared them in family gatherings,\
and he read them to me when\
1:10\
I needed counsel, guidance, or\
strengthening of my faith.\
1:14\
I heard him share them in\
talks and assignments.\
1:17\
I not only knew them, but I can still\
remember the sound of his voice\
1:22\
and the spiritual feelings I had as he\
shared them. Through sharing scriptures\
1:28\
and feelings, my father\
helped me to establish\
1:30\
a firm foundation of faith\
in the Lord Jesus Christ.\
1:35\
My father particularly loved the account\
of the Savior's visit to\
1:38\
the people of Nephi. This sacred\
account is of the resurrected\
1:43\
and exalted Lord Jesus Christ.\
1:46\
He had drunk of the bitter cup\
and suffered all things\
1:50\
so that we would not suffer\
if we would repent.\
1:54\
He had visited the spirit world\
and organized the preaching of\
1:57\
the gospel there. He had\
risen from the dead,\
2:01\
and He had been with and received\
commandments from\
2:04\
the Father to share scriptures with\
2:07\
the Nephites that would bless\
future generations.\
2:10\
He was exalted and had all of His\
eternal power and capacity.\
2:16\
We can learn from every detail\
of His teachings.\
2:21\
In 3 Nephi 11, we read how\
2:23\
the Savior descended out\
of heaven to teach\
2:26\
the Nephites that He was Jesus Christ,\
2:29\
“whom the prophets testified\
[would] come into the world.”\
2:33\
He declared that He was the light of\
the world and that He glorified\
2:36\
the Father in taking on\
the sins of the world.\
2:40\
He invited the people to come forth,\
2:43\
to put their hands into His side,\
and to feel the prints of\
2:46\
the nails in His hands and in His feet.\
2:50\
He wanted them to know that He was\
the God of Israel who was slain\
2:55\
for the sins of the world.\
2:57\
The people joyfully responded,\
2:59\
going forth one by one until\
they had all seen\
3:02\
and felt that it was truly “He,\
of whom it was written by\
3:06\
the prophets, that should come.”\
3:10\
Jesus taught the Nephites about\
the importance of repentance,\
3:13\
about becoming as a little child, and\
3:16\
the need to be baptized by\
one having His authority.\
3:19\
He then taught much of the doctrine\
that we are studying this year in\
3:23\
the New Testament. In 3 Nephi 17,\
3:27\
we read that Jesus told the people it\
was time for Him to go unto the Father\
3:33\
and also to show Himself unto\
the lost tribes of Israel.\
3:38\
As He cast His eyes on the multitude,\
He noticed that “they were in tears,\
3:43\
[looking] steadfastly upon Him as\
if they would ask him to [tarry]\
3:49\
a little longer [with them].”\
3:51\
The Savior’s response to the Nephites\
was both touching and instructive.\
3:56\
He said, “Behold, my bowels are filled\
with compassion towards you.”\
4:02\
I believe that His compassion was\
much more than a response to\
4:07\
the people’s tears. It seems\
He could see them through\
4:11\
the eyes of His atoning sacrifice.\
4:14\
He saw their every pain, affliction, and\
temptation. He saw their sicknesses.\
4:21\
He saw their infirmities,\
4:22\
and He knew from His agonizing\
suffering in Gethsemane\
4:26\
and Golgotha how to succor them\
according to their infirmities.\
4:33\
Similarly, when our Savior Jesus\
Christ looks upon us,\
4:38\
He sees and understands the pain\
and burden of our sins.\
4:43\
He sees our addictions and challenges.\
4:46\
He sees our struggles and\
afflictions of any kind,\
4:50\
and He is filled with compassion\
towards us.\
4:55\
His gracious invitation to\
the Nephites followed:\
4:59\
“Have ye any that are sick among you?\
Bring them hither.\
5:04\
Have ye any that are lame, or blind,\
or halt, or maimed, or leprous,\
5:09\
or that are withered, or that are deaf,\
or that are afflicted in any manner?\
5:15\
Bring them hither and I will heal them,\
for I have compassion upon you;\
5:20\
my bowels are filled with mercy.”\
5:24\
And the people came forth “with all them\
that were afflicted in any manner;\
5:29\
and he did heal them, every one as\
they were brought forth unto him.”\
5:36\
In 1990, we were living in the small\
town of Sale in Victoria, Australia.\
5:42\
We were happily busy with family,\
church, and work commitments.\
5:46\
On a beautiful summer Saturday,\
just before Christmas,\
5:49\
we decided to visit some parks\
and a favorite beach.\
5:54\
After enjoying a wonderful\
day playing as a family,\
5:57\
we packed everyone into the\
car and headed home.\
6:01\
While driving, I momentarily fell\
asleep and caused a head-on\
6:06\
car accident. After some moments of\
recovery, I looked around the vehicle.\
6:14\
My wife, Maxine, had a badly broken leg\
and was struggling to breathe.\
6:19\
She had a broken sternum.\
6:22\
Our three daughters were in shock, but\
thankfully appeared to be okay.\
6:27\
I had some minor injuries, but our five-\
month-old son was unresponsive.\
6:35\
Amid the stress and confusion of that\
accident scene, our eldest daughter,\
6:41\
11-year-old Kate, said with urgency,\
6:44\
“Dad, you need to give\
Jarom a blessing.”\
6:49\
After some struggle, my daughters and\
I managed to get out of the car.\
6:54\
Maxine couldn’t be moved. Carefully\
I picked Jarom up.\
6:59\
Then, while lying on the\
ground on my back,\
7:02\
I gently placed him on my chest and\
gave him a priesthood blessing.\
7:08\
By the time the ambulance arrived,\
about 40 minutes later,\
7:12\
Jarom was conscious. That night,\
7:16\
I left three family members\
in the hospital and took\
7:19\
a hushed taxi ride home\
with my two daughters.\
7:23\
Through the long night, I pled with\
Heavenly Father that my family\
7:28\
and those injured in the other vehicle\
would recover. Mercifully,\
7:33\
my prayers and fervently offered prayers\
by many others were answered.\
7:38\
All were healed over time—a great\
blessing and tender mercy.\
7:44\
Yet I continued to have deep feelings of\
guilt and remorse for causing such\
7:50\
a terrible accident. I would wake\
during the night and relive\
7:54\
the horrific events. I struggled\
for years to forgive myself\
7:59\
and to find peace. Then as\
a priesthood leader,\
8:04\
assisting others to repent and helping\
them to feel the compassion,\
8:09\
mercy, and love of the Savior. I\
realized that He could heal me.\
8:18\
The Savior's healing and redeeming power\
applies to accidental mistakes,\
8:23\
poor decisions, challenges, and trials\
of every kind—as well as to our sins.\
8:31\
As I turned to Him, my\
feelings of guilt\
8:35\
and remorse were gradually replaced\
with peace and rest.\
8:40\
President Nelson taught: “When the\
Savior atoned for all mankind,\
8:46\
He opened a way that those who follow\
Him can have access to His healing,\
8:52\
strengthening, and redeeming power.\
8:55\
These spiritual privileges are available\
to all who seek to hear Him\
9:00\
and follow Him.” Brothers and sisters,\
9:06\
whether you are carrying the\
burden of unresolved sin,\
9:10\
suffering because of an offense\
committed against you long ago,\
9:15\
or struggling to forgive yourself\
for an accidental mistake,\
9:20\
you have access to the healing,\
redeeming power of the Savior,\
9:25\
Jesus Christ. I testify that He lives.\
He is our Savior and Redeemer.\
9:33\
He loves us. He has compassion for us.\
He is filled with mercy.\
9:40\
And He can heal you. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
