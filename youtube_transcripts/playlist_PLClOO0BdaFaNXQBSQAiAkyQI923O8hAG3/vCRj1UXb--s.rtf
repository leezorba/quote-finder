My father used to tell me,\
0:04\
“Don’t focus so intensely on your\
problems that you can’t see\
0:08\
the solution.” I testify that\
the Lord Jesus Christ is\
0:13\
the solution to even our most\
difficult problems.\
0:16\
Specifically, He has overcome four\
problems that every one of us faces\
0:22\
and that not one of us\
can solve on our own.\
0:25\
The first problem is physical death.\
0:28\
We can try to delay it or ignore it, but\
we can't overcome it on our own.\
0:34\
Jesus Christ, however, overcame death\
for us and, as a consequence,\
0:40\
we will all be resurrected one day.\
0:44\
The second problem includes the\
tribulations, difficult experiences,\
0:49\
sadness, pain, and unfairness\
of this world.\
0:52\
Jesus Christ overcame all of this.\
0:55\
For those who strive to follow Him,\
0:58\
He will one day “wipe away all tears”\
and make things right again.\
1:04\
In the meantime, He can strengthen us\
to pass through our trials with\
1:09\
confidence, good cheer, and peace.\
1:13\
The third problem is the spiritual\
death arising from sin.\
1:16\
Jesus Christ overcame this problem\
by taking upon Himself\
1:21\
“the chastisement of our peace.”\
1:24\
Because of His atoning sacrifice,\
1:26\
we can be freed from the consequences\
of our sins\
1:30\
if we have faith in the Savior,\
sincerely repent,\
1:34\
accept the covenant the Father offers\
us through essential ordinances such\
1:39\
as baptism, and endure to the end.\
1:42\
The fourth problem is our limited\
and imperfect natures.\
1:47\
Jesus Christ has the solution\
to this problem too.\
1:51\
He doesn't just erase our errors\
and make us innocent again.\
1:55\
He can work “a mighty change in ... our\
hearts that we have no more disposition\
2:00\
to do evil, but to do good continually.”\
2:03\
We can be perfected by the grace of\
Christ and one day become like Him.\
2:10\
Unfortunately, too often\
we concentrate so much\
2:13\
on our own problems that we lose\
focus on the solution,\
2:17\
our Savior, Jesus Christ. How\
do we avoid that mistake?\
2:22\
I believe the answer lies in\
2:24\
the covenants we are invited to make\
with Him and our Father in Heaven.\
2:29\
Our covenants help us\
focus our attention,\
2:32\
our thoughts, and our actions\
on Christ. As we “cleave unto\
2:37\
the covenants [we have] made,” we\
2:38\
can more easily identify “the things of\
this world” that we should “lay aside”\
2:44\
and “the things of a better [world]”\
we should diligently seek.\
2:48\
That’s what the people of Ammon\
did in the Book of Mormon.\
2:52\
As they learned of Jesus Christ and\
began to focus their lives on Him,\
2:57\
they recognized that they should\
bury their weapons of war\
3:01\
and became perfectly honest\
and “distinguished\
3:04\
for their zeal towards God.”\
3:07\
Covenant keeping leads us to seek after\
whatever invites the influence of\
3:12\
the Spirit and reject whatever\
drives it away—\
3:16\
“for we know that if we can be worthy\
of the presence of the Holy Ghost,\
3:20\
we can also be worthy to live in\
3:23\
the presence of Heavenly Father\
and His Son, Jesus Christ.”\
3:27\
This may mean that we have to change\
our vocabulary, using kinder words.\
3:33\
It could mean replacing spiritually\
unhealthy habits with new habits that\
3:38\
strengthen our relationship\
with the Lord,\
3:40\
such as daily prayer and scripture\
study, individually and with our family.\
3:47\
President Russell M. Nelson said that\
“each person who makes covenants in\
3:51\
baptismal fonts and in temples and keeps\
them has increased access to\
3:56\
the power of Jesus Christ.\
3:58\
... The reward for keeping covenants\
with God is heavenly power—\
4:03\
power that strengthens us\
to withstand our trials,\
4:07\
temptations, and heartaches better.”\
4:11\
Renewing our covenants\
during the sacrament\
4:13\
each Sunday is a great opportunity to\
examine ourselves and refocus our lives\
4:19\
on Jesus Christ. By partaking\
of the sacrament, we declare\
4:23\
that “we do always remember Him.”\
The word “always” is so significant.\
4:30\
It extends the Savior's influence\
into every part of our lives.\
4:34\
We don’t remember Him only at church,\
or only during our morning prayers,\
4:40\
or only when we are in trouble\
and we need something.\
4:44\
Yes, we sometimes get distracted.\
We forget. We lose our focus.\
4:49\
But renewing our covenants means that we\
want to always remember the Savior,\
4:55\
that we will try to do so throughout\
the week, and that we will recommit\
5:00\
and refocus on Him again at the\
sacrament table next week.\
5:05\
Clearly focusing on Jesus\
Christ must be more than\
5:08\
a Sunday, at church activity.\
5:11\
When President Nelson introduced\
Come, Follow Me in 2018,\
5:15\
he said, “It is time for a\
home-centered Church.”\
5:20\
He said we should “transform [our] home\
into a sanctuary of faith” and\
5:25\
“a center of gospel learning.”\
5:27\
And he made four wonderful\
promises to us if we do.\
5:32\
The first promise: “Your Sabbath\
days will truly be a delight.”\
5:39\
It will become a day when we\
draw closer to our Savior.\
5:43\
As a young woman from Peru said,\
5:46\
“The Lord’s day is the day I get the\
most answers from the Lord.”\
5:51\
The second promise: “Your children will\
be excited to learn and to live\
5:57\
the Savior’s teachings.” That\
is why “we talk of Christ,\
6:03\
we rejoice in Christ,\
we preach of Christ, ...\
6:07\
that our children may\
know to what source\
6:09\
they may look for a remission of their\
sins.” We do this so that one day,\
6:15\
when our son goes out to work\
or to hike in the mountains\
6:19\
or to hunt beasts in the forest,\
as Enos did,\
6:22\
he may remember what we taught\
him about Christ and about\
6:26\
the joy of living the gospel.\
6:29\
And who knows, maybe this will be the\
day when he will finally feel\
6:33\
the spiritual hunger that turns him\
to Jesus Christ so he can hear\
6:38\
the voice of the Lord saying to him,\
6:41\
“Thy sins are forgiven thee,\
and thou shalt be blessed.”\
6:46\
The third promise: “The influence\
of the adversary in your life\
6:50\
and in your home will decrease.” Why?\
6:55\
Because the more we focus\
on Jesus Christ,\
6:58\
the more sin loses its appeal.\
As our homes are filled with\
7:03\
the Savior’s light, there is less and\
less room for the darkness of\
7:07\
the adversary. The fourth promise:\
“Changes in your family will be dramatic\
7:14\
and sustaining.” Why? Because the change\
that Jesus Christ brings is\
7:20\
“a mighty change.” He changes our very\
natures; we become “new creatures.”\
7:25\
We gradually become more like the\
Savior, filled with His pure love\
7:31\
for all of God's children.\
7:33\
Who wouldn't want these promises\
fulfilled in their lives\
7:37\
and in their family’s? What do\
we need to do to obtain them?\
7:41\
The answer is to transform our homes\
into a sanctuary of faith and\
7:47\
a center of gospel learning.\
And how do we do that?\
7:50\
By focusing on Heavenly Father\
and Jesus Christ,\
7:53\
making Them the center\
of our family life,\
7:57\
the most important influence\
in our home.\
8:01\
Could I suggest that you begin by making\
the words of Christ found in\
8:05\
the scriptures a daily\
part of your life?\
8:09\
There is no prescribed formula\
for perfect scripture study.\
8:13\
It could be 5 or 10 minutes each\
day or more if you can.\
8:17\
It could be a chapter or\
a few verses a day.\
8:21\
Some families prefer to study in\
the morning before they leave\
8:25\
for school or work. Others prefer\
to read at night before bed.\
8:31\
Some young couples have told me that\
they study individually on\
8:35\
the way to work and then share insights\
with each other via text\
8:41\
so their comments and discussions\
are recorded.\
8:44\
Come, Follow Me provides many\
suggestions of activities\
8:49\
and resources that can help individuals\
8:51\
and families learn gospel principles\
from the scriptures.\
8:55\
The Bible videos and the Book of Mormon\
videos can also be valuable tools\
9:00\
to make the scriptures more\
accessible to your family.\
9:04\
Youth and children are often inspired\
by the memory stories in\
9:08\
the scriptures. These stories and\
9:11\
the gospel principles they teach will\
stay with your children like trusted\
9:15\
friends when they need good examples of\
service, virtue, obedience, patience,\
9:21\
perseverance, personal revelation,\
charity,\
9:26\
humility, and faith in Jesus Christ.\
9:29\
Over time, your consistency\
in feasting on\
9:33\
the word of God will help your children\
grow closer and closer to the Savior.\
9:38\
They will come to know\
Him as never before.\
9:43\
The Lord Jesus Christ lives today.\
9:46\
He can be an active daily\
presence in our lives.\
9:50\
He is the solution to our problems.\
9:53\
But we must lift our eyes and\
raise our sights to see Him.\
9:57\
He has said, “Look unto me in every\
thought; doubt not, fear not.”\
10:04\
As we focus on Him and\
our Father in Heaven,\
10:07\
make and keep covenants with\
Them, and make Them\
10:11\
the most important influence\
in our home and family,\
10:14\
we will become the kind of people\
President Nelson envisioned:\
10:19\
“A people who are able, ready\
and worthy to receive\
10:25\
the Lord when He comes again,\
10:27\
a people who have already chosen Jesus\
Christ over this fallen world\
10:33\
a people who rejoice in\
their agency to live the\
10:36\
higher, holier laws of Jesus Christ.”\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
