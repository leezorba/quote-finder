My dear brothers and sisters,\
it is a joy to be with you.\
0:06\
During these past six months,\
0:08\
you have been constantly on\
my mind and in my prayers.\
0:14\
I pray that the Holy Ghost\
will communicate what\
0:18\
the Lord wants you to hear\
as I speak to you now.\
0:25\
During my surgical internship\
many years ago,\
0:29\
I assisted a surgeon who was amputating\
0:32\
a leg filled with highly\
infectious gangrene.\
0:38\
The operation was difficult. Then,\
to add to the tension,\
0:43\
one of the team performed a task poorly,\
and the surgeon erupted in anger.\
0:51\
In the middle of his tantrum, he threw\
his scalpel loaded with germs.\
0:57\
It landed in my forearm.\
1:03\
Everyone in the operating room except\
1:06\
the out-of-control surgeon was horrified\
by this dangerous breach of\
1:12\
surgical practice. Gratefully,\
I did not become infected.\
1:19\
But this experience left a\
lasting impression on me.\
1:25\
In that very hour, I promised myself\
that whatever happened in my operating\
1:30\
room, I would never lose\
control of my emotions.\
1:36\
I also vowed that day never to\
throw anything in anger,\
1:42\
whether it be scalpels or words.\
1:48\
Even now, decades later, I\
find myself wondering if\
1:53\
the contaminated scalpel\
that landed in my arm\
1:58\
was any more toxic than the venomous\
contention that infects our civic\
2:03\
dialogue and too many personal\
relationships today.\
2:08\
Civility and decency seem to have\
disappeared during this era of\
2:15\
polarization and passionate\
disagreements.\
2:20\
Vulgarity, faultfinding, and evil\
speaking of others are all too common.\
2:28\
Too many pundits, politicians,\
2:32\
entertainers, and other influencers\
throw insults constantly.\
2:39\
I am greatly concerned that\
2:41\
so many people seem to believe that it\
is completely acceptable to condemn,\
2:46\
malign, and vilify anyone who\
does not agree with them.\
2:54\
Many seem eager to damage another's\
reputation with pathetic\
3:00\
and pithy barbs.\
3:05\
Anger never persuades. Hostility\
builds no one.\
3:13\
Contention never leads to\
inspired solutions.\
3:19\
Regrettably, we sometimes see\
contentious behavior even within our\
3:24\
own ranks. We hear of those who belittle\
their spouses and children,\
3:32\
of those who use angry outbursts\
to control others,\
3:38\
and of those who punish family members\
with the silent treatment.\
3:44\
We hear of youth and children who bully\
3:48\
and of employees who defame\
their colleagues.\
3:54\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
this should not be.\
3:59\
As disciples of Jesus Christ,\
4:02\
we are to be examples of how\
to interact with others,\
4:07\
especially when we have differences\
of opinion.\
4:13\
One of the easiest ways to identify\
4:15\
a true follower of Jesus Christ is how\
compassionately that person treats\
4:21\
other people.\
4:25\
The Savior made this clear in His sermon\
to followers in both hemispheres.\
4:32\
“Blessed are the peacemakers,” He said.\
4:36\
“Whosoever shall smite thee\
on thy right cheek,\
4:39\
turn to him the other also.”\
4:43\
And then, of course, He gave\
4:46\
the admonition that challenges each\
of us, “Love your enemies,\
4:52\
bless them that curse\
you, do good to them\
4:58\
that hate you, and pray for them which\
despitefully use you and persecute you.”\
5:05\
Before His death,\
5:10\
the Savior commanded His twelve Apostles\
5:13\
to love one another as\
He had loved them.\
5:19\
And then He added, “By this shall all\
men know that ye are my disciples, if\
5:26\
ye have love one to another.”\
5:31\
The Savior's message is clear.\
5:34\
His true disciples build, lift,\
encourage, persuade, and inspire,\
5:43\
no matter how difficult the situation.\
5:48\
True disciples of Jesus Christ\
are peacemakers.\
5:55\
Today is Palm Sunday. We are preparing\
to commemorate the most important\
6:02\
and transcendent event ever\
recorded on Earth,\
6:06\
which is the Atonement\
and Resurrection of\
6:09\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
6:14\
One of the best ways we can honor the\
Savior is to become a peacemaker.\
6:22\
The Savior’s Atonement made it possible\
for us to overcome all evil,\
6:27\
including contention. Make no mistake\
about it, contention is evil.\
6:35\
Jesus Christ declared\
that those who have\
6:38\
the spirit of contention are not of Him,\
6:40\
but are “of the devil, who is the\
father of contention,” and\
6:46\
the devil “stirreth up the hearts of men\
6:48\
to contend with anger,\
one with another.”\
6:54\
Those who foster contention are taking\
a page out of Satan’s playbook,\
7:02\
whether they realize it or not.\
No man can serve two masters.\
7:09\
We cannot support Satan with\
our verbal assaults\
7:14\
and then think that we\
can still serve God.\
7:21\
My dear brothers and sisters, how we\
treat each other really matters.\
7:30\
How we speak to and about others\
at home, at church,\
7:35\
at work, and online really matters.\
7:41\
Today I'm asking us to interact with\
others in a higher, holier way.\
7:49\
Please listen carefully.\
7:54\
“If there is anything virtuous,\
7:57\
lovely, or of good report or\
praiseworthy” that we can say about\
8:02\
another person, whether to his\
face or behind her back,\
8:09\
that should be our standard\
of communication.\
8:16\
If a couple in your ward\
gets divorced, or\
8:19\
a young missionary returns home early,\
or teenager doubts his testimony,\
8:27\
they do not need your judgment.\
8:32\
They need to experience the pure love of\
Jesus Christ reflected in your words\
8:37\
and actions. If a friend on social\
media has strong political\
8:45\
or social views that violate\
everything you believe in,\
8:49\
an angry, cutting retort\
by you will not help.\
8:56\
Building bridges of understanding\
will require much more of you,\
9:03\
but that is exactly what\
your friend needs.\
9:10\
Contention drives away the\
Spirit every time.\
9:16\
Contention reinforces the false\
notion that confrontation is\
9:22\
the way to resolve differences, but it\
never is. Contention is a choice.\
9:33\
Peacemaking is a choice. You have\
your agency to choose contention\
9:40\
or reconciliation. I urge you to\
be a peacemaker now and always.\
9:51\
Brothers and sisters, we can\
literally change the world\
9:56\
one person and one interaction\
at a time. How?\
10:03\
By modeling how to manage honest\
differences of opinion with mutual\
10:10\
respect and dignified dialogue.\
10:17\
Differences of opinion are part of life.\
10:21\
I work every day with dedicated\
servants of\
10:24\
the Lord who do not always see\
an issue the same way.\
10:29\
They know I want to hear their ideas\
10:32\
and honest feelings about everything we\
discuss, especially sensitive issues.\
10:40\
My two noble councilors, President\
Oaks and President Eyring,\
10:46\
are exemplary in the way they\
express their feelings,\
10:51\
especially when they may differ. They\
do so with pure love for each other.\
11:00\
Neither suggests\
that he knows best\
11:04\
and therefore must rigorously\
defend his position.\
11:09\
Neither evidences the need to\
compete with the other.\
11:14\
Because each is filled with charity,\
the pure love of Christ,\
11:21\
our deliberations can be guided\
by the Spirit of the Lord.\
11:26\
How I love and honor these\
two great men.\
11:33\
Charity is the antidote to contention.\
11:38\
Charity is the spiritual gift that helps\
us to cast off the natural man,\
11:44\
who is selfish, defensive, prideful,\
and jealous.\
11:52\
Charity is the principal characteristic\
of a true follower of Jesus Christ.\
11:59\
Charity defines a peacemaker.\
12:06\
When we humble ourselves before\
God and pray with all\
12:10\
the energy of our hearts, God\
will grant us charity.\
12:18\
Those blessed with this supernal gift\
are long suffering and kind.\
12:24\
They do not envy others and are not\
caught up in their own importance.\
12:31\
They are not easily provoked and\
do not think evil of others.\
12:38\
Brothers and sisters, the pure love\
of Christ is the answer to\
12:41\
the contention that ails us today.\
12:45\
Charity propels us to bear\
one another’s burdens\
12:51\
rather than heap burdens\
upon each other.\
12:56\
The pure love of Christ allows us to\
stand as witnesses of God at all times\
13:01\
and in all things, especially\
in tense situations.\
13:10\
Charity allows us to demonstrate how men\
and women of Christ speak and act,\
13:17\
especially when under fire.\
13:22\
Now, I am not talking about\
peace at any price,\
13:28\
I'm talking about treating others in\
ways that are consistent with keeping\
13:32\
the covenant you make when you\
partake of the sacrament.\
13:37\
You covenant to always\
remember the Savior.\
13:43\
In situations that are highly charged\
and filled with contention,\
13:49\
I invite you to remember Jesus Christ.\
13:55\
Pray to have the courage and wisdom\
to say or do what He would.\
14:02\
As we follow the Prince of Peace,\
we will become His peacemakers.\
14:12\
At this point, you may be thinking that\
this message would really help someone\
14:16\
you know.\
14:22\
Perhaps you're hoping that it will help\
him or her to be nicer to you.\
14:28\
I hope it will.\
14:32\
But I also hope that you will look\
deeply into your heart to see if there\
14:38\
are shards of pride or jealousy that\
prevent you from becoming a peacemaker.\
14:46\
If you are serious about helping\
to gather Israel\
14:50\
and about building relationships that\
will last throughout the eternities,\
14:55\
now is the time to lay aside bitterness.\
15:01\
Now is the time to cease insisting\
that it is your way or no way.\
15:08\
Now is the time to stop doing things\
that make others walk on eggshells\
15:13\
for fear of upsetting you.\
15:17\
Now is the time to bury\
your weapons of war.\
15:22\
If your verbal arsenal is filled\
with insults and accusations,\
15:29\
now is the time to put them away.\
15:33\
You will arise as a spiritually\
strong man or woman of Christ.\
15:42\
The temple can help us\
in our quest. There,\
15:47\
we are endowed with God’s power, giving\
us the ability to overcome Satan,\
15:53\
the instigator of all contention. Cast\
him out of your relationships.\
16:01\
Note that we also rebuke the\
adversary every time we heal\
16:06\
a misunderstanding\
16:08\
or refuse to take offense.\
16:13\
Instead, we can show the tender mercy\
that is characteristic of true\
16:19\
disciples of Jesus Christ. Peacemakers\
thwart the adversary.\
16:29\
Let us as a people become a\
true light on the hill,\
16:34\
a light that cannot be hid.\
16:38\
Let us show that there is a peaceful\
and respectful way\
16:43\
to resolve complex issues and\
16:47\
an enlightened way to work\
out disagreements.\
16:53\
As you demonstrate the charity that true\
followers of Jesus Christ manifest,\
16:59\
the Lord will magnify your efforts\
beyond your loftiest imagination.\
17:10\
The gospel net is the largest\
net in the world.\
17:15\
God has invited all to come unto Him,\
“black and white, bond and free,\
17:22\
male and female.” There’s\
room for everyone.\
17:28\
However, there is no room for prejudice,\
17:33\
condemnation, or contention of any kind.\
17:39\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
17:41\
the best is yet to come for those who\
spend their lives building up others.\
17:49\
Today, I invite you to examine your\
discipleship within the context of\
17:55\
the way you treat others.\
17:59\
I bless you to make any adjustment\
that may be needed\
18:04\
so that your behavior is ennobling,\
respectful,\
18:08\
and representative of a true\
follower of Jesus Christ.\
18:15\
I bless you to replace belligerence\
with beseeching,\
18:20\
animosity with understanding, and\
contention with peace. God lives.\
18:30\
Jesus is the Christ. He stands\
at the head of this Church.\
18:36\
We are His servants. He will help\
us to become His peacemakers.\
18:44\
I so testify in the sacred name\
of Jesus Christ. Amen.\
