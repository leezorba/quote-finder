With faith in Jesus Christ and hope in\
what they had heard of His miracles,\
0:07\
the caregivers of a man with\
palsy brought him to Jesus.\
0:11\
They were innovative in\
getting him there,\
0:13\
uncovering the roof and lowering\
the man on his bed to\
0:17\
the place where Jesus was teaching.\
0:20\
When Jesus saw their faith, He\
said to the man with palsy,\
0:23\
thy sins are forgiven thee,\
0:25\
and then, arise and take up thy bed\
and go thy way into thine house.\
0:31\
And immediately the man with palsy arose\
and took his bed and departed\
0:37\
for home, glorifying God.\
0:40\
What more do we know of the friends who\
provided care for the man with palsy?\
0:45\
We know that the Savior recognized\
their faith.\
0:49\
And having seen and heard the Savior and\
being a witness to his miracles,\
0:54\
they were amazed and glorified God.\
0:58\
Jesus Christ had provided\
the hoped-for healing,\
1:03\
physical relief from pain and\
1:05\
the crippling consequences\
of chronic disease.\
1:08\
Significantly, the Savior also provided\
spiritual relief in cleansing\
1:14\
the man from sin. And the friends? In\
their efforts to care for one in need,\
1:21\
they found the source of relief.\
They found Jesus Christ.\
1:29\
I testify that Jesus Christ is relief.\
Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ,\
1:37\
we may be relieved of the burden\
and consequences of sin\
1:41\
and be succored in our infirmities.\
1:44\
And because we love God and have\
covenanted to serve Him,\
1:48\
we can partner with the Savior to help\
provide temporal and spiritual relief\
1:53\
for those in need, and in the process,\
find our own relief in Jesus Christ.\
2:01\
Our beloved Prophet, President Russell\
M. Nelson, invited us to overcome\
2:06\
the world and find rest. He defined\
true rest as relief and peace.\
2:13\
President Nelson said,\
2:16\
“Because the Savior, through\
His infinite Atonement,\
2:19\
redeemed each of us from weakness,\
mistakes and sin,\
2:23\
and because He experienced every pain,\
worry, and burden you have ever had,\
2:29\
then as you truly repent\
and seek His help,\
2:32\
you can rise above this present\
precarious world.”\
2:38\
That is the relief Jesus\
Christ offers us.\
2:44\
Each of us is carrying a\
metaphorical backpack.\
2:48\
It may be a basket balanced on\
your head or a satchel or\
2:52\
a bundle of things wrapped in cloth\
and thrown over your shoulder.\
2:55\
But for our thinking, let's\
call it a backpack.\
2:59\
This metaphorical backpack is where\
we carry the burdens of living in\
3:03\
a fallen world. Our burdens are\
like rocks in the backpack.\
3:08\
Generally, there are three kinds.\
Focks there of our own doing\
3:13\
because of sin, rocks in our backpack\
because of the poor decisions,\
3:18\
misconduct, and unkindness of\
others, and rocks we carry\
3:22\
because we are living in\
a fallen condition.\
3:25\
These include the rocks of disease,\
pain, chronic illness, grief,\
3:30\
disappointment, loneliness ,and\
3:31\
the effects of\
natural disasters.\
3:35\
I joyfully declare that our mortal\
burdens, these rocks in our figurative\
3:42\
backpack, need not feel heavy. Jesus\
Christ can lighten our load.\
3:48\
Jesus Christ can lift our burdens.\
3:51\
Jesus Christ provides a way for us to\
be relieved of the weight of sin.\
3:57\
Jesus Christ is our relief.\
4:02\
He said, “Come unto me all ye that\
labor and are heavy laden and\
4:06\
I will give you rest.” That\
is relief and peace.\
4:10\
“Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;\
for I am meek and lowly in heart:\
4:14\
and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\
For my yoke is easy,\
4:20\
and my burden is light.” That\
the yoke is easy and\
4:24\
the burden is light presumes we get\
in the yoke with the Savior,\
4:28\
that we share our burdens with Him,\
that we let Him lift our load.\
4:33\
That means entering into a covenant\
relationship with God\
4:37\
and keeping that covenant, which as\
President Nelson has explained,\
4:42\
makes everything about life easier.\
4:45\
He said, “Yoking yourself with\
4:48\
the Savior means you have access to\
His strength and redeeming power.”\
4:53\
So why are we stingy with our rocks?\
4:59\
Why would a weary baseball pitcher\
refuse to leave the mound when\
5:03\
a reliever is there, ready\
to complete the game?\
5:07\
Why would I insist on maintaining\
my post alone when\
5:11\
the Reliever stands ready\
to keep it with me?\
5:14\
President Nelson has taught,\
“Jesus Christ stands with open arms,\
5:19\
hoping and willing to heal, forgive,\
cleanse, strengthen,\
5:22\
purify, and sanctify us.”\
5:26\
So why do we insist on carrying\
our rocks alone?\
5:30\
It is intended as a personal question\
for each of you to consider.\
5:37\
For me, it is the age old vice of pride.\
I’ve got this, I say. No worries,\
5:43\
I’ll get it done. It’s the great\
deceiver who wants me to hide from God,\
5:48\
to turn away from Him,\
to go at it alone.\
5:52\
Brothers and sisters, I can’t go at\
it alone. And I don’t need to,\
5:57\
and I won’t. Choosing to be bound\
to my Savior, Jesus Christ,\
6:03\
through the covenants I\
have made with God,\
6:05\
“I can do all things through Christ\
which strengtheneth me.”\
6:11\
Covenant keepers are blessed\
with the Savior's relief.\
6:15\
Consider the example in\
the Book of Mormon.\
6:18\
The people of Alma were persecuted\
with tasks upon them\
6:21\
and taskmasters over them. Forbidden\
to pray vocally,\
6:25\
they “did pour out\
their hearts to [God];\
6:27\
and he did know the thoughts\
of their hearts.\
6:30\
And ... the voice of the Lord came to\
them in their afflictions, saying:\
6:33\
Lift up your heads and\
be of good comfort,\
6:36\
for I know of the covenant which\
ye had made [with] me; and\
6:40\
I will covenant with my people and\
deliver them out of bondage.\
6:45\
And I will also ease the burdens which\
are put upon their shoulders, that even\
6:49\
you cannot fill them upon your backs...\
[and their burdens] were made light;\
6:54\
[and] the Lord did strengthen them\
6:56\
that they could bear up their\
burdens with ease,\
6:59\
and they did submit cheerfully and\
with patience to all the will of\
7:03\
the Lord.” Those covenant keepers\
received relief in the form of comfort,\
7:09\
increased patience and cheerfulness,\
and ease in their burdens\
7:13\
so that they felt light, and\
ultimately deliverance.\
7:17\
Now let's return to our own\
metaphorical backpack.\
7:21\
Repentance through the Atonement of\
Jesus Christ is what relieves us of\
7:25\
the weight of the rocks of sin.\
7:27\
And by this exquisite gift,\
7:30\
God's mercy relieves us from the heavy\
7:32\
and otherwise insurmountable\
demands of justice.\
7:36\
The Atonement of Jesus Christ\
also makes it possible\
7:39\
for us to receive strength to forgive,\
7:42\
which allows us to unload the weight we\
carry because of mistreatment by others.\
7:47\
So how does the Savior relieve us\
of the burdens of living in\
7:51\
a fallen world with mortal bodies\
subject to grief and pain?\
7:55\
Often, He performs that kind\
of relief through us.\
8:00\
As covenant members of His Church,\
8:02\
we promise to “mourn with\
those that mourn,\
8:05\
and comfort those that stand in need\
of comfort.” Because we are come into\
8:10\
the fold of God and are\
called His people,\
8:12\
We are willing to bear one another’s\
burdens that they may be light.\
8:16\
Our covenantal blessing is to partner\
with Jesus Christ in providing relief,\
8:22\
both temporal and spiritual,\
to all of God's children.\
8:26\
We are a conduit through which\
He provides relief.\
8:30\
And so, like the friends\
of the man with palsy,\
8:33\
we succor the weak, lift up the hands\
which hang down, and strengthen\
8:37\
the feeble knees. We bear one another's\
burdens and so fulfill\
8:41\
the law of Christ. As we do, we come\
to know Him, become like Him,\
8:47\
and find His relief. What is relief?\
8:52\
It is the removal or lightning\
of something painful,\
8:55\
troubling, or burdensome, or\
the strength to endure it.\
8:59\
It refers to a person who takes\
the place of another.\
9:03\
It is the legal correction of a wrong.\
9:05\
The Anglo-French word comes\
from old French,\
9:08\
the word relever, or “to raise up,”\
and from the Latin relevere,\
9:14\
or “raise again.” Brothers and sisters,\
Jesus Christ is relief.\
9:22\
I testify that He did rise\
again on the third day,\
9:26\
and having fulfilled the loving\
9:28\
and infinite Atonement, stands\
with open arms,\
9:31\
offering to us the opportunity\
to rise again,\
9:35\
be saved, and be exalted\
and become like Him.\
9:39\
The relief He offers us is everlasting.\
9:44\
Like the women visited by the angel\
on that first Easter morning,\
9:50\
I wish to go quickly and with great joy\
to bring the word that He is risen.\
10:00\
In the name of our Savior,\
Jesus Christ. Amen.\
