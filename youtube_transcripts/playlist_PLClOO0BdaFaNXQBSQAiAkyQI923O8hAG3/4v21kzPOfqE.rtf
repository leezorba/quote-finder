Throughout His mortal ministry,\
0:04\
the Savior showed great compassion\
for all of God's children,\
0:08\
especially for those who were suffering\
or had fallen away.\
0:11\
When criticized by the Pharisees\
for associating with\
0:15\
and eating among sinners,\
0:17\
Jesus responded by teaching\
three familiar parables.\
0:21\
In each of these parables,\
0:23\
He emphasized the importance of seeking\
out those who had strayed and\
0:28\
the joy that is felt when they returned.\
0:30\
For example, in the parable of\
the lost sheep, He said:\
0:35\
“[Great] joy shall be in heaven over\
one sinner that repenteth.”\
0:41\
My desire today is to strengthen\
the connection between joy\
0:45\
and repentance—more specifically,\
0:48\
the joy that comes when we repent and\
the feelings of joy we experience\
0:53\
as we invite others to come unto Christ\
0:55\
and receive His atoning sacrifice\
in their lives.\
1:00\
In the scriptures, the word “joy”\
typically means much more than passing\
1:05\
moments of contentment or even\
feelings of happiness.\
1:09\
Joy, in this context is a godly\
attribute found in its fullness when we\
1:14\
return to dwell in the presence of God.\
1:17\
It is more profound, elevating,\
1:20\
enduring, and life-changing\
than any pleasure\
1:24\
or comfort this world can offer.\
We were created to have joy.\
1:29\
It is our intended destiny as children\
of a loving, Heavenly Father.\
1:33\
He wants to share His joy with us.\
1:36\
The Prophet Lehi taught\
that God’s plan\
1:39\
for each of us is that we “might have\
joy.” Because we live in a fallen world,\
1:45\
enduring joy or everlasting joy\
often seems beyond our reach.\
1:51\
Yet in the very next verse,\
1:53\
Lehi continues by explaining that\
the Messiah came to redeem us from\
1:57\
the fall. Redemption by and through\
the Savior Jesus Christ\
2:02\
makes joy possible. The gospel message\
is a message of hope, of good tidings\
2:09\
of great joy, and the means whereby\
all can experience peace\
2:14\
and occasions of joy in this life,\
and receive a fullness of joy in\
2:18\
the life to come. The joy we speak\
of is a gift for the faithful.\
2:23\
Yet it comes with a price. Joy is\
not cheap or casually given.\
2:28\
Rather, it is bought with the precious\
blood of Jesus Christ.\
2:33\
If we really understood the\
value of true godly joy,\
2:36\
we would not hesitate to sacrifice\
any worldly possession\
2:41\
or make any necessary life\
changes to receive it.\
2:45\
A powerful but humble king in\
the Book of Mormon understood this.\
2:51\
“What shall I do?” he asked,\
2:53\
“that I may be born of God,\
2:55\
having this wicked spirit rooted out of\
my breast, and receive his spirit, that\
3:00\
I may be filled with joy. Behold, said\
he, I will give up all that I possess,\
3:06\
yea, I will forsake my kingdom\
3:08\
that I might receive this great joy.”\
3:12\
In response to the King’s question,\
the missionary Aaron said, “If thou\
3:16\
desirest this thing, ... bow down before\
God ... and repent of all thy sins.”\
3:22\
Repentance is the pathway to joy,\
3:25\
because it is the pathway that leads\
us to the Savior Jesus Christ.\
3:30\
For some to think of repentance as\
3:32\
a pathway to joy might\
seem contradictory.\
3:35\
Repentance at times can be\
painful and difficult.\
3:39\
It requires admitting that some\
of our thoughts and actions—\
3:43\
even some of our beliefs—may be wrong.\
3:46\
Repentance also requires change, which,\
at times, can be uncomfortable.\
3:52\
But joy and comfort are\
not the same thing.\
3:55\
Sin—including the sin of complacency—\
limits our joy.\
4:00\
As stated by the Psalmist, “weeping\
may endure for a night,\
4:04\
but joy cometh in the morning.”\
4:07\
As we repent of our sins, we must focus\
on the great joy that follows.\
4:11\
The nights may seem long,\
4:13\
but the morning does come, and oh,\
how exquisite is the peace\
4:18\
and resplendent joy we feel as\
4:21\
the Savior’s Atonement frees\
us from sin and suffering!\
4:25\
Consider the experience of Alma\
in the Book of Mormon.\
4:28\
He was “racked with eternal torment,”\
4:32\
and his soul was “harrowed\
up” because of his sins.\
4:35\
But once he turned to the\
Savior for mercy,\
4:38\
he could “remember [his] pains no more.\
“And oh, what joy,” he declared,\
4:44\
“and what marvelous light I did behold,\
4:46\
yea, ... there can be nothing so\
exquisite and sweet as was my joy.”\
4:53\
This is the kind of joy available to\
those who come unto Jesus Christ\
4:56\
through repentance. As President\
Nelson has taught, quote,\
5:01\
“Repentance opens our access\
to the power of\
5:04\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ. When we\
choose to repent, we choose to change.\
5:10\
We allow the Savior to transform us into\
the better version of ourselves.\
5:15\
We choose to grow spiritually\
and receive joy,\
5:18\
the joy of redemption in Him.\
5:21\
When we choose to repent, we choose\
to become more like Jesus Christ,”\
5:27\
end quote. Repentance brings joy\
5:30\
because it prepares our hearts to\
receive the influence of the Holy Ghost.\
5:35\
To be filled with the Holy Ghost\
means to be filled with joy\
5:39\
and to be filled with joy means to\
be filled with the Holy Ghost.\
5:43\
Our joy increases as we work daily to\
bring the Spirit into our lives\
5:48\
as taught by the prophet Mormon:\
5:50\
“Nevertheless, they did\
fast and pray oft,\
5:54\
and did wax stronger and stronger\
in [their] humility and firmer\
5:58\
and firmer in [their] faith\
[in] Christ, unto\
6:02\
the filling of their souls\
with joy and consolation.”\
6:05\
The Lord promises all who\
work to follow Him,\
6:11\
“I will impart unto you my Spirit which\
shall enlighten your mind,\
6:16\
which shall fill your soul with joy.”\
6:20\
After we felt the joy that comes\
from sincere repentance,\
6:24\
we quite naturally want to share\
that joy with others. As we do,\
6:29\
our joy multiplies. That’s exactly what\
happened to Alma. “This is my glory,”\
6:35\
he said, “that perhaps I may\
be an instrument in\
6:38\
the hands of God to bring\
some soul to repentance;\
6:42\
and this is my joy. And behold,\
6:45\
when I see many of my brethren\
truly penitent and coming to\
6:49\
the Lord their God, then is\
my soul filled with joy.\
6:54\
Then do I remember what the\
Lord has done for me, ...\
6:56\
yea, then do I remember how\
merciful his arm has been,\
7:01\
which he extended [to] me.”\
Helping others repent is\
7:05\
a natural expression of our gratitude\
toward the Savior, and it is\
7:09\
a source of great joy. The\
Lord has promised,\
7:13\
“If it so be that you should\
bring save it be one soul unto me,\
7:17\
how great shall be your joy with him\
in the kingdom of my Father.\
7:22\
And now, if your joy will be great with\
one soul that you have brought unto me,\
7:26\
how great will be your joy if you\
should bring many souls unto me.”\
7:32\
I find it helpful to try\
and imagine the joy\
7:34\
the Savior must feel each\
time we receive\
7:36\
the blessings of His atoning\
sacrifice in our lives.\
7:40\
As cited by President Nelson,\
the apostle Paul,\
7:43\
in his epistle to the Hebrews,\
shared this tender insight:\
7:48\
“Lay aside every ... sin which doth\
so easily beset us, ...\
7:53\
looking unto Jesus, the author\
and finisher of our faith;\
7:57\
who, for the joy that was set before\
him endured the cross, ...\
8:02\
and is set down at the right\
hand of the throne of God.”\
8:06\
We speak often of the pain and\
suffering of Gethsemane\
8:10\
and Calvary, but seldom do\
we speak of the great joy\
8:13\
the Savior must have anticipated\
as He offered His life for us.\
8:18\
Clearly, His pain and His suffering were\
for us that we might experience\
8:23\
the joy of returning with Him\
to the presence of God.\
8:28\
After teaching the people\
of ancient America,\
8:30\
the Savior expressed His great love\
for them by saying, “Now behold,\
8:35\
my joy is great, even unto fullness,\
8:38\
because of you ...; and even the Father\
rejoiceth, and also all\
8:43\
the holy angels. ... In [you] I\
have [a] fullness of joy.”\
8:49\
Brothers and sisters, I conclude\
by sharing my personal witness,\
8:53\
which I consider a sacred gift.\
8:55\
I testify that Jesus Christ is the\
Savior and Redeemer of the world.\
9:00\
I know that He loves each of us.\
9:03\
His singular focus, His work and\
His glory, is to help us receive\
9:08\
a fullness of joy in Him.\
9:11\
I am a personal witness\
that repenting daily\
9:13\
and coming unto Jesus Christ is\
9:15\
a way to experience joy, joy beyond our\
imagination. That is why we are here.\
9:22\
That is why God prepared His great\
plan of happiness for us.\
9:26\
Jesus Christ truly is “the way,\
9:29\
the truth, and the life,” and\
9:32\
the only “name given under heaven\
whereby man can be saved in\
9:35\
the kingdom of God.” I so testify in the\
sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
