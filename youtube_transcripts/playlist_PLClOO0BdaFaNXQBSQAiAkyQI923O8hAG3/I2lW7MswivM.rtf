President Russell M. Nelson,\
our beloved prophet,\
0:05\
has profoundly emphasized our unique\
responsibility is to help gather\
0:12\
scattered Israel and prepare the world\
for the second coming of Jesus Christ.\
0:17\
The Father of our spirits desires His\
children to be safely gathered home.\
0:27\
Our Heavenly Father's plan\
0:28\
for safely gathering His children to\
our heavenly home is not based\
0:34\
on worldly success, economic status,\
education, race, or gender.\
0:40\
Father's plan is based on righteousness,\
0:44\
keeping His commandments, and receiving\
sacred ordinances and honoring\
0:50\
the covenants we make. The divinely\
inspired doctrine that we are all\
0:55\
brothers and sisters and “all are alike\
unto God” underlies this great work\
1:01\
of gathering. This doctrine accords\
with those who deeply desire\
1:07\
for people of diverse economic\
1:09\
and racial status to experience\
better lives.\
1:13\
We applaud and join in such efforts.\
1:17\
Moreover, we desire for all of God's\
children to come unto Him and receive\
1:25\
the eternal blessings He offers\
through His Gospel.\
1:30\
In the Lord’s preface to the Doctrine\
and Covenants, He declares,\
1:34\
“Hearken ye people from afar; and ye\
that are upon the islands of\
1:38\
the sea, listen together.” I love that\
the very first verse in the Doctrine\
1:44\
and Covenants includes the people who\
are on “the islands of the sea.”\
1:50\
I have had three specific calls to\
serve and live on the islands of\
1:54\
the sea. I first served as a young\
missionary to the British Isles.\
1:58\
Second, as a new General Authority in\
the Philippines islands, and then\
2:03\
as Area President in the\
Pacific Islands,\
2:05\
which includes Polynesian Islands.\
2:08\
All three of these areas have\
successfully gathered believers to\
2:13\
the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.\
2:16\
Missionaries first arrived in\
the British Isles in 1837.\
2:20\
This was one year after Joseph Smith's\
dedication of the Kirtland Temple,\
2:25\
where Moses committed “the keys of\
the gathering of Israel from\
2:30\
the four parts of the earth and the\
leading of the ten tribes from\
2:34\
the land of the north.”\
The early success in\
2:37\
the British Isles is legendary.\
2:39\
By 1851, over half the members of\
2:43\
the Church were baptized converts\
living in the British Isles.\
2:49\
In 1961, Elder Gordon\
B. Hinckley visited\
2:52\
and initiated full-time missionary\
efforts in the Philippine Islands.\
2:56\
At that time, there was only one\
Filipino Melchizedek Priesthood holder.\
3:02\
Amazingly, there are\
over 850,000\
3:07\
members of the Church today\
in the Philippine Islands.\
3:11\
I admire the Philippine people.\
3:13\
They have a deep and abiding\
love for the Savior.\
3:18\
Perhaps less well known is the\
ongoing missionary effort to\
3:22\
the Polynesian Islands. It commenced in\
1844 when Addison Pratt arrived in\
3:27\
what is now French Polynesia.\
3:30\
Many Polynesians already believed\
in eternal families\
3:34\
and accepted Jesus Christ\
as their Savior. Today,\
3:38\
almost 25 percent of Polynesians in the\
Polynesian Islands are members of\
3:44\
the Church. I once listened\
to a 17-year-old girl on\
3:48\
a distant Tahitian island who was\
a seventh generation member.\
3:54\
She paid tribute to her ancestors who\
had been converted in 1845, two years\
4:02\
before early Church members arrived\
in the Salt Lake Valley.\
4:07\
These examples are just a part\
of a much larger picture.\
4:11\
President Nelson has continuously\
emphasized that\
4:15\
the gathering of Israel is the “greatest\
challenge, cause, and ... work\
4:19\
on the earth today.” Until\
the Restoration of\
4:23\
the Church of Jesus Christ,\
4:25\
including the coming forth of the Book\
of Mormon and the revelation\
4:29\
and priesthood keys given to\
the Prophet Joseph Smith,\
4:33\
understanding of the gathering of Israel\
was fragmentary and limited.\
4:39\
The distinctive name “Israel” was the\
title conferred upon Jacob.\
4:45\
It came to represent the posterity of\
Abraham through Isaac and Jacob. The\
4:49\
original promise and covenant to Father\
Abraham is set forth in Abraham 2:9–10,\
4:54\
which reads in part: “And\
I will make of thee a great nation, ...\
5:00\
And I will bless [all nations]\
through thy name;\
5:03\
for as many as receive this Gospel\
shall be called after thy name,\
5:08\
and shall be accounted thy seed, and\
shall rise up and bless thee,\
5:13\
as their father.” During the Council in\
Heaven, in the premortal existence,\
5:19\
the plan of salvation was\
discussed and sustained.\
5:23\
It included certain laws\
and ordinances of\
5:26\
the priesthood instituted before\
the foundation of the world\
5:30\
and predicated upon the gathering.\
5:33\
It also included the overriding\
principle of agency.\
5:37\
After several centuries as a powerful\
people, including the reigns of Saul,\
5:43\
David, and Solomon, Israel was divided.\
5:46\
The tribe of Judah and part of\
the tribe of Benjamin became\
5:49\
the kingdom of Judah. The remainder,\
identified as the ten tribes,\
5:54\
became the kingdom of Israel.\
5:57\
After 200 years of separate existence,\
6:00\
the first gathering of Israel\
occurred in 721 BC when\
6:04\
the ten tribes of Israel were carried\
away captive by the Assyrian king.\
6:10\
They later went to the\
north countries. In 600 BC\
6:15\
at the commencement of\
the Book of Mormon,\
6:17\
Father Lehi led a colony of\
Israelites to the Americas.\
6:21\
Lehi understood the scattering of\
Israel, of which he was a part.\
6:26\
He is quoted by Nephi as saying that\
6:29\
“the House of Israel ... should\
be compared like unto\
6:33\
an olive tree, whose branches\
should be broken off\
6:36\
and should be scattered upon\
all the face of the earth.”\
6:41\
In the so-called New World,\
6:43\
the history of the Nephites and\
Lamanites as set forth in\
6:46\
the Book of Mormon ends\
in approximately AD 400.\
6:51\
Descendants of Father Lehi are\
spread throughout the Americas.\
6:56\
This is clearly described by Mormon\
in 3 Nephi 5:20,\
7:01\
which reads, “I am Mormon and a\
pure descendant of Lehi.\
7:06\
I have reason to bless my God\
7:08\
and my Savior Jesus Christ, that\
he brought our fathers out of\
7:12\
the land of Jerusalem.” Clearly,\
7:15\
the high point in Israel’s\
chronological history is\
7:20\
the birth, message, ministry, and\
mission of our Lord and Savior,\
7:25\
Jesus Christ. After the Savior’s\
eternity-shaping death\
7:30\
and resurrection, a second well-known\
scattering of Judah occurred between\
7:36\
70 AD and 135 AD when, due to Roman\
oppression and persecution,\
7:42\
the Jews dispersed throughout\
the then known world.\
7:46\
President Nelson has taught: “The Book\
of Mormon came forth as a sign that\
7:51\
the Lord had commenced to gather\
[the] children of the covenant.”\
7:56\
Thus, the Book of Mormon,\
7:58\
translated by the Prophet Joseph Smith\
through the gift and power of God,\
8:02\
is directed to Lehi’s descendants,\
scattered Israel,\
8:07\
and Gentiles who are adopted\
into the tribes of Israel.\
8:11\
The heading to 1 Nephi 22,\
reads in part:\
8:15\
“Israel will be scattered upon\
all the face of the earth—The\
8:20\
Gentiles will nurse and nourish Israel\
with the gospel in the last days.”\
8:26\
The Book of Mormon title page reads\
that one of its purposes is for\
8:32\
“the convincing of the Jew and Gentile\
that Jesus is the Christ.”\
8:37\
With the Restoration and Book of Mormon,\
8:40\
the concept of gathering Israel\
has greatly expanded.\
8:44\
Those who accept the gospel of Jesus\
Christ, regardless of lineage,\
8:49\
become part of gathered Israel.\
8:52\
With that gathering and the numerous\
temples built and announced,\
8:57\
we are in a unique position to gather\
Israel on both sides of the veil\
9:02\
as never before under the Father’s plan.\
9:06\
President Spencer W. Kimball, speaking\
of the literal gathering of Israel,\
9:10\
stated: “Now the gathering of Israel\
consists of joining the true church\
9:16\
and ... coming to a knowledge\
of the true God.\
9:20\
Any person, therefore, who has\
accepted the restored gospel\
9:25\
and who now seeks to worship the\
Lord in his own tongue and with\
9:30\
the saints in the nations\
where he lives,\
9:32\
has complied with the law of\
the gathering of Israel\
9:36\
and is heir to all of the blessings\
promised to Saints in these last days.\
9:42\
... The gathering of Israel now involves\
conversion,” end quote.\
9:48\
As viewed through a clear lens,\
9:50\
members of The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints have\
9:54\
the great privilege of loving, sharing,\
inviting,\
10:00\
and helping gather Israel to\
receive the fullness of\
10:04\
the Lord’s covenant blessings.\
10:06\
This includes Africans and Europeans,\
South and North Americans, Asians,\
10:12\
Australians, and those upon\
the Isles of the Sea.\
10:17\
“For verily, the voice of the\
Lord is unto all men.”\
10:22\
“This gathering shall continue until\
the righteous are assembled in\
10:25\
the congregation of the Saints,\
in the nations of the world.”\
10:30\
No one has addressed the gathering\
more directly than\
10:34\
President Russell M. Nelson.\
10:36\
“Any time you do anything that helps\
anyone on either side of the veil\
10:42\
take a step toward making\
covenants with God\
10:45\
and receiving their essential baptismal\
and temple ordinances,\
10:50\
you are helping to gather Israel. It\
is as simple as that,” end quote.\
10:56\
Where is the Church today?\
10:58\
In the 62 years since I commenced\
serving a mission in 1960,\
11:03\
the number of full-time missionaries\
serving under a call from\
11:07\
the prophet has increased from\
7,683 to 62,544.\
11:17\
The number of missions has\
increased from 58 to 411.\
11:22\
The number of members has increased\
from approximately 1,700,000\
11:28\
to approximately 17 million.\
11:32\
The COVID 19 pandemic temporarily\
impacted some of our opportunities to\
11:37\
share the gospel. It also provided\
experience using new technology,\
11:42\
which will greatly enhance\
the gathering.\
11:46\
We are grateful that members\
11:48\
and missionaries are now expanding\
efforts to gather scattered Israel.\
11:52\
Growth continues everywhere, especially\
South America and Africa.\
11:58\
We also appreciate that so many across\
12:02\
the world have responded to President\
Nelson's powerful invitation\
12:07\
for increased missionary service.\
12:10\
Nevertheless, our commitment to love,\
12:13\
share, and invite can be\
greatly expanded.\
12:17\
An essential part of this\
missionary effort is\
12:21\
for individual members to become beacon-\
light examples wherever we live.\
12:26\
We cannot be in camouflage.\
12:29\
Our Christlike example of kindness,\
righteousness,\
12:33\
happiness, and sincere love for all\
peoples can create not only\
12:39\
a guiding beacon light for them,\
12:42\
but also an understanding that\
there is a safe harbor in\
12:47\
the ordinances of salvation\
and exaltation of\
12:51\
the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.\
12:54\
Please understand that there are\
remarkable blessings in sharing\
12:59\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
13:01\
The scriptures speak of joy and peace,\
forgiveness of sins,\
13:05\
protection from temptations, and\
sustaining power from God.\
13:11\
Looking beyond this mortal life,\
13:13\
we will be prepared to share the\
gospel with those in darkness\
13:18\
and under the bondage of sin in the\
great world of the spirits of\
13:22\
the dead. My specific prayer today is\
for every child, young man, young woman,\
13:29\
family, quorum, Relief Society, and\
class to review how we individually\
13:35\
and collectively accept dramatic counsel\
to help gather Israel that has\
13:41\
been issued by the Lord and\
our beloved Prophet.\
13:45\
We respect agency. In this\
secular world,\
13:49\
many will not respond and participate\
in the gathering of Israel,\
13:53\
but many will. And the Lord expects\
those who have received His gospel to\
14:00\
urgently strive to be a beacon-light\
example that will help others come to\
14:06\
God. This allows our brothers and\
sisters across the earth to enjoy\
14:11\
the supernal blessings\
and ordinances of\
14:14\
the restored gospel of Jesus Christ\
and be safely gathered home.\
14:21\
I bear my sure and certain\
apostolic witness of\
14:25\
the divinity of Jesus Christ and our\
Father in Heaven’s plan for us.\
14:30\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
