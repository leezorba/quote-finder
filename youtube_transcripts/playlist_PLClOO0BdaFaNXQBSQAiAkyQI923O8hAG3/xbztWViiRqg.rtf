Thank you, President Oaks,\
0:04\
that was a beautiful reminder of the\
words of our Lord, whom we all love.\
0:11\
As we remember this weekend\
0:13\
the Savior’s triumphal\
entry into Jerusalem\
0:17\
shortly before His atoning sacrifice, I\
recall His words of hope and comfort:\
0:26\
“I am the resurrection, and\
0:29\
the life: he that believeth in me,\
though he were dead, yet shall he live.”\
0:38\
I love Him. I believe Him.\
0:41\
I testify that He is the resurrection\
and the life.\
0:48\
This testimony has comforted\
and strengthened me during\
0:52\
the past four and a half years since\
my wife, Barbara, passed away.\
0:58\
I miss her. Often I have been reflecting\
on our eternal marriage\
1:04\
and our life together. I previously have\
shared how I first met Barbara\
1:11\
and how that experience taught me to\
use the skill of “following up” that\
1:18\
I learned on my mission. I had to\
follow up quickly with her after\
1:24\
I first met her.\
1:27\
She was beautiful, popular, and had\
a very busy social calendar.\
1:33\
I was smitten early because she\
was approachable and friendly.\
1:39\
I admired her goodness. I felt that\
she and I belonged together.\
1:45\
It seemed simple in my mind.\
1:49\
Barbara and I dated and our relationship\
began to grow,\
1:54\
but she was uncertain that marriage\
to me was right for her.\
1:59\
It wasn’t enough for me to know, but\
Barbara needed to know for herself.\
2:06\
I knew if we spent time fasting\
and praying about the matter,\
2:11\
Barbara could receive a\
confirmation from heaven.\
2:16\
We spent a weekend without dating,\
2:19\
so we could fast and pray individually\
to know for ourselves.\
2:24\
Fortunately for me, she received the\
same confirmation that I did.\
2:31\
The rest, as they say, is history.\
2:36\
When Barbara passed away,\
2:39\
our children put on her headstone\
several lessons that Barbara wanted\
2:44\
them to remember. One of those lessons\
is “What matters most is what lasts\
2:53\
longest.” Today I will share from my\
heart a few feelings and thoughts\
3:01\
on what matters most. First,\
3:05\
the relationship with our Heavenly\
Father and His Son,\
3:10\
the Lord Jesus Christ,\
is most important.\
3:14\
This relationship matters most\
now and in eternity.\
3:20\
Second, family relationships are among\
those things that matter most.\
3:28\
Throughout my ministry, I have\
visited many individuals\
3:33\
and families impacted by devastating\
natural disasters.\
3:38\
Many were displaced, hungry,\
and frightened.\
3:44\
They needed medical assistance,\
food, and shelter.\
3:49\
They also needed their families.\
3:53\
I recognize some may not have the\
blessing of a close family,\
4:00\
so I include extended family, friends,\
and even ward families as family.\
4:09\
These relationships are essential for\
emotional and physical health.\
4:17\
These relationships can also offer love,\
joy, happiness and a sense of belonging.\
4:26\
Nurturing these important relationships\
is a choice.\
4:31\
A choice to be part of a family requires\
commitment, love, patience,\
4:38\
communication, and forgiveness. There\
may be times when we disagree with\
4:46\
another person, but we can do\
that without being disagreeable.\
4:53\
In courtship and marriage,\
4:55\
we don't fall in love\
or fall out of love\
4:59\
as though we are objects being\
moved on a chessboard.\
5:04\
We choose to love and\
sustain one another.\
5:08\
We do the same in our\
family relationships\
5:13\
and with friends who are\
like family to us.\
5:18\
The family proclamation states that\
5:22\
“The divine plan of happiness enables\
family relationships to be perpetuated\
5:30\
beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances\
5:34\
and covenants available in holy\
temples make it possible\
5:39\
for individuals to return to\
the presence of God and\
5:44\
for families to be united eternally.”\
5:49\
Another thing that matters most is\
following the promptings of the Spirit\
5:54\
in our most important relationships\
5:58\
and in our efforts to love our\
neighbors as ourselves,\
6:02\
including in our private\
and public ministries.\
6:08\
I learned this lesson early in my\
life while serving as a bishop.\
6:15\
Late one cold, snowy winter\
6:17\
evening, I was leaving my\
bishop’s office when I had\
6:22\
a strong impression to visit an\
elderly widow in the ward.\
6:28\
I glanced at my watch—it was 10 p.m.\
6:32\
I reasoned that it was too late to make\
such a visit. Besides, it was snowing.\
6:42\
I decided to visit this dear\
sister first thing in\
6:45\
the morning rather than disturbing\
her at such a late hour.\
6:50\
I drove home and went to bed,\
6:53\
but tossed and turned throughout\
the night because\
6:57\
the Spirit was stirring me.\
6:59\
Early the next morning, I drove\
straight to the widow's home.\
7:04\
Her daughter answered the door and\
tearfully said, “Oh, Bishop,\
7:11\
thank you for coming. Mother passed away\
two hours ago.” I was devastated.\
7:21\
I will never forget the feelings\
of my heart. I wept.\
7:26\
Who, more than this dear widow, deserved\
to have her bishop hold her hand,\
7:33\
comfort her, and perhaps give\
her a final blessing?\
7:38\
I missed that opportunity because\
I reasoned away this strong,\
7:45\
prompting from the Spirit.\
Brothers and sisters,\
7:50\
young men and young women\
and Primary children,\
7:54\
I testify that following the promptings\
of the Spirit is one of\
8:00\
the things that matters most\
in all our relationships.\
8:06\
Finally, on this Palm Sunday weekend,\
8:10\
I testify that being converted to the\
Lord, bearing testimony of Him\
8:17\
and serving Him, are also among\
the things that matters most.\
8:24\
Faith in Jesus Christ is the foundation\
of our testimonies.\
8:30\
A testimony is a witness or confirmation\
of eternal truth\
8:36\
impressed upon individual hearts and\
souls through the Holy Ghost.\
8:42\
A testimony of Jesus Christ, born of\
and strengthened by the Spirit,\
8:49\
changes lives. It changes the way\
we think and how we live.\
8:56\
A testimony turns us toward our Heavenly\
Father and His divine Son.\
9:03\
Alma taught: “Behold, I testify\
unto you that\
9:10\
I do know that these things whereof\
I have spoken are true.\
9:16\
And how do you suppose that\
I know of their surety?\
9:22\
Behold, I say unto you, they\
are made known unto me by\
9:27\
the Holy Spirit of God. Behold,\
9:31\
I have fasted and prayed many days that\
I may know these things of myself.\
9:38\
And now I do know of myself\
that they are true;\
9:43\
for the Lord God hath made them\
manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit.”\
9:53\
Having a testimony alone is not enough.\
As our conviction—\
10:00\
conversion to Jesus Christ grows, we\
naturally want to testify of Him—\
10:07\
His goodness, love, and kindness.\
10:11\
Often in our testimony\
and fast meetings on Sunday,\
10:18\
we hear the phrases “I’m thankful”\
and “I love” more than we hear\
10:24\
the phrases “I know” and “I believe.”\
10:30\
I invite you to bear your testimony\
of Jesus Christ more often.\
10:35\
Bear testimony of what you know\
and believe and what you feel\
10:42\
and not just what you are thankful\
for. Testify of your own experiences\
10:50\
of coming to know and love the Savior,\
10:54\
of living His teachings, and of His\
redemptive, enabling power in your life.\
11:03\
As you bear testimony of what\
you know, believe, and feel,\
11:08\
the Holy Ghost will confirm the truth\
11:11\
to those who earnestly listen\
to your testimony.\
11:17\
They will do so because they\
have watched you become\
11:22\
a peaceful follower of Jesus Christ.\
11:26\
They see what it means\
to be His disciple.\
11:31\
They will also feel something they\
may not have felt before.\
11:37\
A pure testimony comes from a changed\
heart and can be carried by\
11:44\
the power of the Holy Ghost into\
11:47\
the hearts of others who\
are open to receive it.\
11:51\
Those who feel something as a result\
of your testimony may then ask\
11:58\
the Lord in prayer to confirm\
the truth of your testimony.\
12:03\
Then they can know for themselves.\
12:07\
Brothers and sisters, I testify\
and witness to you that\
12:12\
I know that Jesus Christ is the Savior\
and Redeemer of the world. He lives.\
12:21\
He is the resurrected Son of God.\
And this is His Church,\
12:27\
led by His prophet and apostles.\
12:31\
I pray that someday when I\
pass to the next world,\
12:35\
I may do so with my testimony\
12:38\
burning brightly. In my ministry,\
12:42\
I have learned what matters most is our\
relationships with Heavenly Father\
12:49\
and His Beloved Son, our families,\
and our neighbors,\
12:54\
and allowing the Spirit of the Lord\
to guide us in those relationships\
13:01\
so we can testify of the things that\
matter most and last longest, to which I\
13:09\
share in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
