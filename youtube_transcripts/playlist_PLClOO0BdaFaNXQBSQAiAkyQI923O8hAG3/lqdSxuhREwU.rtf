As we have been reminded this morning,\
0:04\
today is Palm Sunday, marking\
0:07\
the Savior's triumphal entry\
into Jerusalem and\
0:10\
the beginning of that holy week\
preceding His great Atonement,\
0:13\
which would include His suffering,\
Crucifixion, and Resurrection.\
0:19\
Not long before His prophesied\
entry into the city,\
0:22\
Jesus Christ was fully engaged in His\
ministry when He received word from\
0:27\
his dear friends Mary and Martha that\
their brother Lazarus was sick.\
0:33\
Although Lazarus’s illness was serious,\
0:35\
the Lord “abode two days still in\
the same place where he was.\
0:40\
Then after that saith he to his\
disciples, Let us go into Judea again.”\
0:46\
Before beginning the journey to\
his friends’ home in Bethany,\
0:50\
“said Jesus plainly unto them,\
Lazarus is dead.”\
0:56\
When Jesus came into Bethany and\
met first Martha and then Mary,\
1:00\
perhaps out of frustration for His late\
arrival, they each greeted him saying,\
1:06\
“Lord, if thou hadst been here,\
my brother had not died.”\
1:12\
Martha further exclaimed,\
1:13\
“By this time he stinketh, for\
he hath been dead four days.”\
1:19\
These four days were significant\
to Mary and Martha.\
1:23\
According to some rabbinic\
schools of thought,\
1:26\
it was believed that the spirits of\
those who died would remain with\
1:30\
the body for three days, offering hope\
that life was still possible.\
1:35\
However, by the fourth day,\
that hope was lost,\
1:40\
perhaps because the body would\
begin to decay and “stinketh.”\
1:46\
Mary and Martha were in\
this state of despair,\
1:50\
“when Jesus therefore saw Mary\
weeping ...\
1:53\
he groaned in the spirit, and\
was troubled, and said,\
1:57\
Where have ye laid him? They said\
unto him, Lord, come and see.”\
2:04\
It is at this moment that we see one\
of the great miracles during\
2:08\
the Savior’s mortal ministry. First the\
Lord said, “Take ye away the stone.”\
2:14\
Then, after thanking His Father,\
“He cried with a loud voice,\
2:19\
Lazarus, come forth. And he that\
was dead came forth, bound hand\
2:24\
and foot with graveclothes: and his face\
was bound about with a napkin.\
2:29\
Jesus saith unto them, Loose\
him and let him go.”\
2:34\
Like Mary and Martha, we have\
2:37\
the opportunity to experience all of\
mortality, even sorrow and weakness.\
2:42\
Each of us will experience the\
heartache that accompanies\
2:46\
the loss of someone we love.\
2:49\
Our mortal journey might include\
personal illness or\
2:52\
the debilitating illness of a loved one;\
2:54\
depression; anxiety or other mental\
health challenges; financial hardship;\
3:01\
betrayal; sin. And sometimes these are\
accompanied by feelings of hopelessness.\
3:09\
I'm no different. Like you,\
3:11\
I have experienced a myriad of\
challenges that are expected in this\
3:15\
life. I am drawn to this account\
about the Savior\
3:19\
and what it teaches me about\
our relationship with Him.\
3:24\
During our greatest worries,\
3:26\
we, like Mary and Martha,\
3:28\
seek the Savior or ask the Father\
for His divine intervention.\
3:33\
The story of Lazarus teaches us\
principles that can be applied to our\
3:37\
own lives as we face our\
individual challenges.\
3:42\
When the Savior arrived in Bethany,\
3:45\
all had lost hope that Lazarus\
could be saved.\
3:48\
It had been four days, and he was gone.\
Sometimes our own challenges—\
3:54\
during our own challenges, we might\
feel like Christ is too late,\
3:59\
and our hope and faith might\
even feel challenged.\
4:03\
My witness and testimony is that as we\
move forward with faith in Jesus Christ,\
4:08\
the fourth day will always come.\
4:10\
He will always come to our aid or\
to raise our hopes back to life.\
4:15\
He promised, “Let not your\
heart be troubled.”\
4:19\
“I will not leave you comfortless:\
I will come to you.”\
4:23\
Sometimes it may seem like He doesn’t\
come until the figurative fourth day,\
4:29\
after all hope seems lost.\
But why so late?\
4:33\
President Thomas S. Monson taught,\
4:35\
“Our Heavenly Father, who gives\
us so much to delight in,\
4:39\
also knows that we learn and grow\
and become stronger as we face\
4:45\
and survive the trials through\
which we must pass.”\
4:49\
Even the prophet Joseph Smith faced\
an enormous fourth day experience.\
4:53\
Remember his pleading?\
“O God, where art thou?\
4:57\
And where is the pavilion that\
covereth thy hiding place?”\
5:00\
As we trust in Him, we can expect a like\
answer: “My son [or daughter], peace\
5:06\
be unto thy soul; thine adversity and\
thine afflictions shall be but\
5:10\
a small moment.” Another message\
we can learn from\
5:14\
the story of Lazarus is what\
our own role might be in\
5:17\
the divine intervention we seek.\
5:19\
When Jesus approached the tomb, He first\
said to those who were there,\
5:24\
“Take ye away the stone.” With the\
power that the Savior had,\
5:28\
could not He have miraculously moved\
the stone without effort?\
5:31\
This would have been impressive to see\
and an unforgettable experience.\
5:35\
Yet He said to the others,\
“Take ye away the stone.”\
5:40\
Secondly, the Lord “cried with a loud\
voice, Lazarus, come forth.”\
5:45\
Wouldn’t it have been more impressive\
if the Lord had Himself placed in\
5:50\
a miraculous way Lazarus at the opening,\
5:53\
so he would be immediately visible to\
the crowd when the stone was removed?\
5:57\
Thirdly, when Lazarus did come forth,\
6:00\
he was “bound hand and foot\
with graveclothes:\
6:03\
and his face was bound\
about with a napkin.\
6:05\
Jesus saith unto them, Loose\
him and let him go.”\
6:09\
I'm sure the Lord was capable of\
having Lazarus standing at\
6:13\
the opening already clean\
and approachable,\
6:15\
with his graveclothes nicely folded.\
6:18\
So what is the point of highlighting\
these aspects?\
6:22\
Each of these three things\
had something in common.\
6:25\
None required the use of\
Christ's divine power.\
6:29\
That which His disciples could do,\
He instructed them to do.\
6:35\
The disciples were certainly capable\
of moving the stone themselves.\
6:38\
Lazarus, after being raised,\
6:40\
had the capacity to stand and present\
himself at the opening of the cave.\
6:45\
And those who loved Lazarus could\
absolutely help him remove\
6:49\
the graveclothes. However,\
6:52\
it was only the Christ\
who had the power\
6:55\
and authority to raise Lazarus\
from the dead.\
6:59\
My impression is that the Savior\
expects us to do all we can do,\
7:04\
and He will do what only He can do.\
7:08\
We know that “Faith [in the Lord Jesus\
Christ] is a principle of action”\
7:12\
and “Miracles do not produce faith,\
7:14\
but strong faith is developed by\
obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
7:18\
In other words, faith comes\
by righteousness.”\
7:23\
As we strive to act righteously by\
making and keeping sacred covenants\
7:28\
and applying the doctrine\
of Christ in our lives,\
7:30\
our faith will not only be sufficient\
to carry us to the fourth day,\
7:34\
but, with the Lord’s help,\
7:35\
we will be capable of moving stones\
that are in our path,\
7:39\
arising from despair, and loosening\
ourselves of all that binds us.\
7:45\
While the Lord expects us to “do all\
things that lie in our power,”\
7:48\
remember that He will provide needed\
help in all things as we trust in Him.\
7:55\
So how can we move stones\
and build upon His rock?\
7:59\
We can abide by the counsel of prophets.\
8:03\
For example, last October,\
8:05\
President Russell M. Nelson pleaded\
with us to take charge of our own\
8:09\
testimonies of the Savior and His\
gospel, to work for them, nurture them,\
8:13\
to feed them truth, and to avoid\
polluting them with false philosophies\
8:18\
of unbelievers. He promised each of us,\
8:21\
“As you make the continual strengthening\
of your testimony of Jesus Christ\
8:26\
your highest priority, watch for\
miracles to happen in your life.”\
8:32\
We can do this! How can we figuratively\
arise and come forth?\
8:38\
We can joyfully repent and choose\
to obey commandments.\
8:42\
The Lord said, “He that hath my\
commandments, and keepeth them,\
8:47\
he it is that loveth me: and he that\
loveth me shall be loved of my Father,\
8:52\
and I will love him and will\
manifest myself to him.”\
8:57\
We can strive to repent daily and\
joyfully move forward with\
9:01\
a willing heart full of love for\
the Lord. We can do this!\
9:07\
How can we, with the Lord's help, loose\
ourselves of all that binds us?\
9:11\
We can intentionally bind\
ourselves first\
9:13\
and foremost to our Heavenly\
Father and His Son,\
9:16\
Jesus Christ, through covenants. Elder\
D. Todd Christofferson taught,\
9:20\
“What is the source of [our] moral\
and spiritual power,\
9:23\
and how do we obtain it?\
The source is God.\
9:26\
Our access to that power is through our\
covenants with Him. ... In these divine\
9:31\
agreements, God binds Himself\
to sustain, sanctify,\
9:35\
and exalt us in return for our\
commitment to serve Him\
9:39\
and keep His commandments.” We can\
make and keep sacred covenants.\
9:44\
We can do this! “Take ye away the\
stone.” “Come forth.” “Loose him, and\
9:51\
let him go.” Counsels, commandments,\
and covenants. We can do this!\
9:57\
Elder Jeffrey R. Holland promised,\
“Some blessings\
10:00\
come soon, some come late, and some\
don’t come until heaven.\
10:04\
But for those who embrace the gospel\
of Jesus Christ, they come.”\
10:09\
And finally, “Wherefore be of good\
cheer, and do not fear, for I\
10:15\
the Lord am with you, and\
will stand by you.”\
10:18\
This is my witness and testimony, in\
10:22\
the sacred name of He who will always\
come, even Jesus Christ, amen.\
