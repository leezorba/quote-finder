Brothers and sisters, I was raised\
by wonderful parents who loved\
0:08\
and faithfully taught us, their\
children, the gospel.\
0:12\
Sadly, my beloved parents struggled\
in their marriage for years.\
0:19\
I was a Primary child when\
0:21\
I was told that they would likely\
divorce some day, and my siblings and\
0:27\
I would need to choose which\
parent to live with.\
0:30\
As a result, for years, I experienced\
significant anxiety.\
0:36\
However, a gift from my Heavenly Father\
ultimately helped change everything\
0:44\
for me—my patriarchal\
blessing. At age 11,\
0:49\
increasingly worried about\
my parents’ relationship,\
0:52\
I deeply desired my\
patriarchal blessing.\
0:57\
I knew that my Heavenly Father\
knew me perfectly\
1:02\
and knew my specific circumstances,\
1:05\
and I also knew I would receive\
direction from Him.\
1:11\
Immediately after my 12th birthday, I\
received my patriarchal blessing.\
1:16\
That was more than half a century ago,\
1:19\
but I vividly remember the details\
of that sacred experience.\
1:25\
Gratefully, we have inspired direction\
about patriarchal blessings in\
1:29\
the Church’s “General Handbook.”\
1:31\
Quote: “Every worthy baptized member\
is entitled to receive a patriarchal\
1:37\
blessing, which provides inspired\
direction from Heavenly Father.”\
1:44\
A member should be “mature enough\
to understand the significance\
1:48\
and sacred nature of the blessing” and\
“understand the basic doctrine of\
1:55\
the gospel.” “Ideally, the member should\
be young enough that many important\
2:02\
decisions in life are still ahead.”\
2:06\
“Priesthood leaders should not establish\
a minimum age for a member to receive\
2:12\
a patriarchal blessing.” “Each\
patriarchal blessing is sacred,\
2:17\
confidential, and personal.”\
2:21\
“A person who receives a patriarchal\
blessing should treasure its words,\
2:26\
ponder them, and live to\
be worthy to receive\
2:29\
the promised blessings in this life\
and in eternity,” close quote.\
2:37\
Our beloved president,\
Russell M. Nelson,\
2:40\
has repeatedly taught about\
the importance of\
2:44\
a patriarchal blessing, that\
it gives each recipient\
2:48\
“a declaration of lineage back\
to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,”\
2:55\
and that each blessing is “personal\
scripture to you.”\
3:01\
My patriarchal blessing was critically\
important to me when I was young\
3:05\
for numerous reasons. First, through\
the power of the Holy Ghost,\
3:10\
my patriarchal blessing helped me\
understand my true, eternal identity—\
3:18\
who I really was,\
and who I could become.\
3:22\
It helped me know, as President Nelson\
has taught, that I was “a son of God,”\
3:27\
a “child of the covenant,” and a\
“disciple of Jesus Christ.”\
3:33\
I knew that I was known and loved by\
my Heavenly Father and my Savior,\
3:38\
and that They were personally\
involved in my life.\
3:43\
This helped me desire to draw closer\
to Them and increase my faith\
3:49\
and trust in Them. A dear friend\
who joined the Church as\
3:54\
a young adult shared, quote: “When\
the patriarch placed his hands\
3:59\
on my head and spoke my name,\
everything changed.\
4:04\
Not just then, but for\
the rest of my life.\
4:08\
I immediately sensed that—through\
the power by which he spoke—\
4:12\
I was known intimately and deeply.\
4:15\
The words he spoke penetrated\
my entire being.\
4:19\
I knew that Heavenly Father knew\
me inside and out,” close quote.\
4:26\
Knowing who I really was\
helped me understand\
4:30\
and desire to do what\
God expected of me.\
4:34\
This led me to study the covenants\
I had made and\
4:39\
the promised blessings in God's\
covenant with Abraham.\
4:44\
It gave me an eternal perspective that\
inspired me to more fully keep my\
4:48\
covenants. I studied my blessing\
frequently and as a youth, often daily,\
4:56\
which helped me feel the comforting,\
4:59\
guiding influence of the Holy Ghost,\
who helped reduce my anxiety as\
5:05\
I followed His promptings.\
5:08\
This increased my desire to actively\
invite light, truth, and\
5:13\
the Holy Ghost by studying my\
scriptures and praying daily\
5:18\
and trying to more diligently\
study and follow\
5:22\
the teachings of God’s\
prophet and apostles.\
5:26\
My patriarchal blessing also helped\
me desire to be more submissive to\
5:32\
the will of my Heavenly Father,\
5:34\
and that focus helped me\
experience great joy,\
5:39\
despite my personal circumstances.\
5:42\
I received spiritual strength each time\
I studied my patriarchal blessing.\
5:47\
When my parents finally did divorce, my\
patriarchal blessing, as President\
5:53\
Thomas S. Monson taught, had\
for me become “a precious\
5:59\
and priceless personal treasure,”\
even “a personal Liahona.”\
6:06\
Now, please don't misunderstand.\
I wasn't perfect.\
6:10\
I made all sorts of dumb mistakes.\
6:12\
My eternal companion would\
confirm that I still do,\
6:16\
but my patriarchal blessing helped me\
6:19\
and continues to help me desire\
to do better and be better.\
6:25\
Frequently studying my patriarchal\
blessing increased my desire to\
6:29\
withstand temptation. It helped me have\
the desire and courage to repent,\
6:35\
and repentance increasingly\
became a joyful process.\
6:43\
It was vital for me to receive my\
patriarchal blessing while I was young\
6:48\
and while my testimony\
was still growing.\
6:51\
And I am forever grateful\
that my parents\
6:55\
and bishop understood that my desire\
indicated I was ready.\
7:00\
When I was 12, the world was far less\
confusing and distracting than\
7:05\
the world today. President Nelson\
has described today as\
7:09\
“a most complicated time in\
the history of the world,”\
7:13\
a world that is “sin-saturated”\
and “self-centered.”\
7:19\
Fortunately, our youth today are much\
more mature than I was at 12,\
7:24\
and they too have critically important\
decisions to make while they’re young!\
7:30\
They also need to know who they really\
are and that God loves them\
7:35\
and is perfectly aware of them.\
7:39\
Not everyone will desire their\
patriarchal blessing when I did,\
7:43\
but I pray that members who have not\
7:45\
yet received their patriarchal blessing\
will prayerfully seek to know when\
7:50\
they're ready. I promise that\
if you prepare spiritually,\
7:55\
your experience, like mine,\
will be sacred to you.\
7:59\
I also pray that those who have already\
received their patriarchal blessing\
8:04\
will study it and treasure it.\
8:09\
Cherishing my patriarchal\
blessing while\
8:11\
I was young blessed me with courage\
when I was discouraged,\
8:15\
comfort when I was fearful,\
peace when I felt anxious,\
8:22\
hope when I felt hopeless, and\
joy when I needed it most.\
8:28\
My patriarchal blessing helped\
increase my faith\
8:32\
and trust in my Heavenly\
Father and my Savior.\
8:35\
It also increased my love for Them,\
and it still does.\
8:41\
I testify that patriarchal blessings\
do provide inspired direction from\
8:47\
Heavenly Father. I bear my witness of\
8:50\
the living reality of our Father in\
Heaven and His Son, our Savior,\
8:55\
Jesus Christ, who know us, love us,\
and desire to bless us.\
9:01\
I also know with certainty that\
President Russell M. Nelson is God’s\
9:06\
prophet on the earth today. In the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
