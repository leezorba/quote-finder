I am so grateful for the ongoing\
building of temples in this\
0:05\
dispensation of the fulness of times.\
0:08\
Since the early days of the Restoration,\
0:10\
faithful Saints have made many\
sacrifices to receive temple ordinances\
0:16\
and covenants. Following\
their great example,\
0:20\
in 1975, after many economic sacrifices\
to travel from Mexico City,\
0:26\
my dear wife, Evelia, and I being\
accompanied by our dear parents,\
0:32\
were sealed as an eternal husband and\
wife in the Mesa Arizona Temple.\
0:38\
That day, as we were united by the\
authority of the priesthood in\
0:44\
the house of the Lord, we truly\
experienced a glimpse of heaven.\
0:50\
That experience has permitted me\
to appreciate much better how,\
0:55\
after three years of hard work\
and great sacrifice,\
1:00\
the Saints in Kirtland, Ohio,\
1:02\
finally completed their beautiful\
temple in the spring of 1836,\
1:09\
the first in this dispensation.\
1:12\
In March of that same year,\
1:14\
over a thousand people gathered in the\
in the temple and in its entrances\
1:21\
for the dedicatory service.\
1:23\
The prophet Joseph Smith\
1:26\
arose to offer the dedicatory prayer,\
which he had received by revelation.\
1:32\
In it, he described many of\
1:35\
the extraordinary blessings that are\
bestowed upon those who\
1:40\
worthily enter the temples of the Lord.\
1:43\
Then the choir sang the hymn “The Spirit\
of God,” and the congregation stood\
1:49\
for the Hosanna Shout “with such force\
that it seemed to raise the roof from\
1:56\
the building.” One week later,\
1:59\
the Prophet described the appearance of\
the Lord in the temple, who said,\
2:05\
“For behold, I have accepted this house,\
and my name shall be here; and\
2:11\
I will manifest myself to my people\
in mercy in this house.\
2:17\
And the fame of this house shall\
spread to foreign lands;\
2:21\
and this is the beginning of\
2:23\
the blessings which shall be poured\
out upon the heads of my people.”\
2:30\
After this and other visions, Elijah\
2:33\
the Prophet, who was taken to heaven\
without tasting death,\
2:38\
appeared before the prophet Joseph Smith\
and Oliver Cowdery and said,\
2:44\
“Behold, the time has fully come, which\
was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi,\
2:52\
testifying that he [Elijah the Prophet]\
2:55\
should be sent before the great\
and dreadful day of\
2:59\
the Lord come—to turn the hearts of\
the fathers to the children and\
3:04\
the children to the fathers,\
3:06\
lest the whole earth be smitten\
with a curse—\
3:09\
Therefore, the keys of this dispensation\
are committed into your\
3:14\
hands, and by this ye may know that\
the great and dreadful day of\
3:18\
the Lord is near, even at the doors.”\
3:23\
After the Lord restored the sealing\
keys to Joseph Smith,\
3:27\
the work of salvation on both sides of\
the veil began in our dispensation.\
3:34\
Elder Boyd K. Packer taught that “This\
signal event went unheeded by\
3:40\
the world, but it will influence\
the destiny\
3:44\
of every soul who has ever\
lived or ever will live.” Things began\
3:54\
happening quietly. The Church became\
a temple-building church. “In\
4:01\
the world there emerged here and there,\
in a way thought to be spontaneous,\
4:07\
people—organizations and societies—\
interested in tracing genealogies.\
4:14\
This has all taken place since the\
appearance of Elijah in the Kirtland\
4:21\
Temple.\
From that very day, April 3, 1836,\
4:26\
the hearts of the children began\
to turn to their fathers.\
4:30\
Thereafter, ordinances were not\
tentative, but permanent.\
4:35\
The sealing power was with us. No\
authorization transcends it in value.\
4:42\
That power gives substance\
4:44\
and eternal permanence to all ordinances\
performed with proper\
4:48\
authority for both the\
living and the dead.”\
4:53\
Dear brothers and sisters,\
4:55\
the construction and proper use of\
temples has been in any dispensation\
5:01\
a sign of the true Church\
of Jesus Christ.\
5:06\
After the dedication of the\
Salt Lake Temple in 1893,\
5:11\
President Wilford Woodruff encouraged\
the members of the Church to find\
5:17\
the records of their ancestors and to\
record their genealogy by going as far\
5:23\
back as possible in order to bring the\
names into the temple and perform\
5:29\
the ordinances of salvation\
and exaltation.\
5:33\
One year later, 1894, the same\
President Woodruff oversaw\
5:40\
the creation of the Genealogical\
Society of Utah.\
5:45\
One hundred years later, in 1994,\
Elder Russell M. Nelson,\
5:51\
then a member of the Quorum\
of the Twelve Apostles,\
5:54\
said, “Events of that historic year\
established family history\
6:01\
research and temple service\
as one work in the Church.”\
6:08\
Dear brothers and sisters,\
6:10\
the Lord encourages us as members of His\
Church to preserve our own family\
6:17\
history, to learn from our ancestors,\
6:20\
and to make the necessary arrangements\
for them to receive\
6:24\
the ordinances of the gospel\
in the temples,\
6:27\
to help them to progress along\
the covenant path,\
6:31\
which will bless them with\
an eternal family.\
6:36\
That is a central focus of the plan of\
our Heavenly Father: uniting family\
6:43\
for this life and for eternity.\
6:47\
To those of you who do not feel\
capable of doing this work,\
6:52\
you should know that you are not alone.\
6:55\
We can all turn to the tools that\
the Church has prepared\
7:00\
and that are found in the\
FamilySearch Centers,\
7:04\
which we used to know as\
family history centers.\
7:07\
These FamilySearch Centers\
have been designed\
7:11\
so that almost everyone with little\
help can find their ancestors’\
7:17\
information and organize it properly\
so that they can take it to\
7:23\
the house of the Lord. Please contact\
7:27\
the family history consultants\
in your ward\
7:30\
or branch who will guide you every\
step of the way. As we follow\
7:37\
the guidance of the prophets and learn\
how to do our family history\
7:42\
and perform the temple ordinances\
for our ancestors,\
7:46\
we will experience great joy to\
7:49\
the point that we will\
not want to stop doing it.\
7:57\
The Spirit will flood our hearts,\
8:00\
awaken our faculties to do it, and\
guide us as we search for\
8:05\
the names of our ancestors.\
8:08\
But let us remember that family history\
is more than just looking for names,\
8:14\
dates, and places. It is uniting\
families and feeling\
8:19\
the joy that comes from extending to\
them the ordinances of the gospel.\
8:25\
I love the inspiring teaching\
of our beloved prophet,\
8:29\
President Russell M. Nelson, who\
has said, and I quote,\
8:34\
“The temple lies at the center\
of strengthening our faith\
8:39\
and spiritual fortitude because the\
Savior and His doctrine are\
8:44\
the very heart of the temple.\
8:47\
Everything taught in the temple, through\
instruction and through\
8:51\
the Spirit, increases our understanding\
of Jesus Christ.\
8:57\
His essential ordinances bind us to Him\
through sacred priesthood covenants.\
9:03\
Then, as we keep our covenants,\
He endows us with His healing,\
9:10\
strengthening power,” end of quotation.\
9:14\
Certainly the work of the temple\
and family history are one and\
9:22\
the same work in the Church.\
I testify to these truths.\
9:27\
I know this is the Church of the Lord\
Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer,\
9:34\
to whom we remember and venerate at this\
Easter time. I know He loves us.\
9:43\
And when we keep our covenants and\
put our confidence in Him,\
9:47\
He endows us with His healing\
and strengthening power.\
9:53\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
