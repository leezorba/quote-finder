As President Oaks has noted, today is\
Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week,\
0:09\
marking the Lord's triumphal\
entry into Jerusalem.\
0:13\
His suffering in Gethsemane and death\
on the cross just days later\
0:18\
and His glorious Resurrection\
on Easter Sunday.\
0:22\
Let us resolve never to forget what\
Christ endured to redeem us,\
0:28\
and let us never lose the overwhelming\
joy we will feel once again on Easter\
0:33\
as we contemplate His victory\
over the grave and\
0:37\
the gift of universal resurrection.\
0:41\
The evening before the trials and\
crucifixion that awaited Him,\
0:45\
Jesus joined in a Passover\
meal with His apostles.\
0:49\
At the end of this last supper, in\
a sacred intercessory prayer,\
0:55\
Jesus petitioned His father in\
these words: “Holy Father,\
1:00\
keep through thine own name\
1:02\
[mine apostles] whom thou hast given me,\
that they may be one as we are.”\
1:08\
Then, tenderly, the Savior\
extended this invitation\
1:12\
or this petition to all believers.\
1:15\
“Neither pray I for these alone,\
1:17\
but for them also which shall believe\
on me through their word;\
1:21\
That they all may be one;\
1:24\
as thou, Father, art in me, and I in\
thee, that they also may be one in us.”\
1:31\
Becoming one is a recurring theme in\
1:34\
the gospel of Jesus Christ and in God’s\
dealings with His children.\
1:38\
With respect to the city of Enoch,\
the City of Zion in Enoch's day,\
1:43\
it is said that they were of\
one heart and one mind.\
1:47\
Of the early Saints in the primitive\
Church of Jesus Christ,\
1:51\
the New Testament records,\
1:53\
“the multitude of them that believed\
were of one heart and of one soul.”\
1:59\
In our own dispensation, the Lord\
admonished, “I say unto you, be one;\
2:05\
and if ye are not one ye are not mine.”\
2:08\
Among the reasons the\
Lord gave as to why\
2:11\
the early Saints in Missouri\
had failed to establish\
2:15\
a place of Zion was that they are not\
united according to the union\
2:21\
required by the law of the\
Celestial Kingdom.\
2:24\
Where God prevails in all\
hearts and minds,\
2:27\
the people are described as in one,\
the children of Christ.\
2:32\
When the resurrected Savior appeared to\
the ancient Book of Mormon peoples,\
2:36\
He noted with disapproval that in\
2:39\
the past there had been disputations\
among the people about baptism\
2:43\
and other matters. He commanded,\
2:46\
“There shall be no disputations among\
you, as there have hitherto been;\
2:50\
neither shall there be disputations\
among you concerning\
2:53\
the points of my doctrine, as\
there have hitherto been.\
2:57\
For verily, verily I say unto you,\
2:59\
he that hath the spirit of\
contention is not of me,\
3:03\
but is of the devil, who is\
the father of contention.”\
3:07\
In our extremely contentious world,\
how can unity be achieved,\
3:12\
especially in the Church, where we\
are to have one lord, one faith,\
3:18\
one baptism? Paul gives us the key.\
3:22\
“For as many of you as have been\
baptized into Christ have put\
3:26\
on Christ. There is neither\
Jew nor Greek,\
3:29\
there is neither bond nor free, there\
is neither male nor female:\
3:33\
for ye are all one in Christ.”\
3:38\
We are too diverse and at times too\
discordant to be able to come together\
3:44\
as one on any other basis\
or under any other name.\
3:48\
Only in Jesus Christ can\
we truly become one.\
3:53\
Becoming one in Christ happens one by\
one. We each begin with ourselves.\
4:00\
We are dual beings of flesh and spirit\
4:03\
and are sometimes at war\
within ourselves.\
4:06\
As Paul expressed, “For I delight in the\
law of God after the inward man:\
4:12\
But I see another law in [the members\
of my body], warring against\
4:16\
the law of my mind, and bringing me\
into captivity to the law of sin\
4:21\
which is in my members.” Jesus was also\
a being of flesh and spirit.\
4:27\
He was tested, He understands. He can\
help us achieve unity within.\
4:33\
Therefore, drawing upon the light\
and the grace of Christ,\
4:36\
we strive to give our Spirit and\
the Holy Spirit dominance over\
4:41\
the physical. And when we fall short,\
Christ, by His Atonement,\
4:45\
has given us the gift of repentance\
and the opportunity to try again.\
4:51\
If individually we each put on Christ,\
4:55\
then together we can hope\
to become as one.\
4:58\
As Paul said, “the body of Christ.”\
To put\
5:02\
on Christ certainly includes making His\
first and great commandment our first\
5:06\
and greatest commitment. And if we love\
God, we will keep His commandments.\
5:12\
Unity with our brothers and sisters in\
the body of Christ grows as we heed\
5:16\
the second commandment, inextricably\
connected to the first,\
5:21\
to love others as ourselves.\
5:22\
And I suppose an even more perfect\
unity would obtain among us if we\
5:27\
followed the Savior's higher\
5:29\
and holier expression of this second\
commandment, to love one another not\
5:34\
only as we love ourselves,\
but as He loved us.\
5:38\
In sum, it is every man seeking\
the interest of his neighbor\
5:43\
and doing all things with an eye\
single to the glory of God.\
5:47\
President Marion G. Romney,\
5:49\
a former counselor in the First\
Presidency, in explaining how enduring\
5:54\
peace and unity are obtained,\
5:56\
said, “If a single person yielding to\
Satan is filled with the works of\
6:01\
the flesh, he wars within himself.\
6:04\
If two yield, they war within themselves\
and fight with each other.\
6:08\
If many people yield, a society reaps\
the harvest of great stress\
6:13\
and contention. If the rulers\
of a country yield,\
6:17\
there is worldwide contention.”\
6:20\
President Romney continued,\
“Ss the works of\
6:23\
the flesh have universal application, so\
likewise does the gospel of peace.\
6:28\
If one man lives it, he has\
peace within himself.\
6:31\
If two men live it, they each\
have peace within themselves\
6:35\
and with each other. If the citizens\
live it, the nation has domestic peace.\
6:41\
And when there are enough nations\
enjoying the fruit of\
6:44\
the Spirit to control world affairs,\
6:46\
then and only then will the\
war drums throb no longer,\
6:51\
and the battle flags be furled.”\
6:55\
By putting on Christ, it becomes\
possible either to resolve\
6:59\
or to lay aside differences,\
disagreements, and disputes.\
7:04\
A rather dramatic example of overcoming\
division is found in our Church history.\
7:09\
Elder Brigham Henry Roberts, commonly\
known as B. H. Roberts,\
7:14\
born in England in 1857, served as\
a member of the First Council of\
7:19\
the Seventy, what we refer to today\
as the Presidency of the Seventy.\
7:24\
Elder Roberts was an able and tireless\
defender of the restored gospel\
7:29\
and of the Church in some of\
its most difficult times.\
7:33\
In 1895, however, Elder\
Roberts’ service in\
7:36\
the Church was put in jeopardy\
by contention.\
7:39\
B. H. had been appointed as a delegate\
to the convention that drafted\
7:43\
a constitution for Utah when\
it became a state.\
7:47\
Afterward, he decided to\
become a candidate for\
7:50\
the United States Congress, but did not\
notify or seek permission from\
7:55\
the First Presidency. (Things were\
a little different then.)\
8:01\
President Joseph Smith, a counselor\
in the First Presidency,\
8:04\
censured B. H. for that failure in\
a general priesthood meeting.\
8:09\
Elder Roberts lost the election,\
8:11\
and felt his defeat was due in large\
part to President Smith's statements.\
8:16\
He was critical of Church leaders in\
some political speeches and interviews.\
8:21\
He withdrew from active Church service.\
In a lengthy meeting in\
8:26\
the Salt Lake Temple with members of\
the First Presidency and Council of\
8:30\
the Twelve, B. H. remained adamant\
in justifying himself.\
8:35\
Later, President Wilford Woodruff gave\
Elder Roberts three weeks to reconsider\
8:40\
his position.\
If he remained unrepentant,\
8:43\
they would release him from the Seventy.\
8:47\
In a subsequent private meeting\
with Apostles Heber J.\
8:50\
Grant and Francis Lyman, B. H.\
was initially unyielding,\
8:55\
but love and the Holy Spirit ultimately\
prevailed. Tears came to his eyes.\
9:01\
The two apostles were able to respond\
to certain perceived slights\
9:05\
and offenses that troubled B. H.,\
9:07\
and they left with a heartfelt\
plea for reconciliation.\
9:11\
The next morning after lengthy prayer,\
Elder Roberts sent a note to Elders\
9:15\
Grant and Lyman that he was prepared\
to reunite with his brethren.\
9:21\
When he later met with the First\
Presidency, Elder Roberts said,\
9:24\
“I went to the Lord and received light\
9:27\
and instruction through His Spirit to\
submit to the authority of God.”\
9:34\
Motivated by his love of God,\
9:36\
B. H. Roberts remained a faithful\
and an able Church leader to\
9:41\
the end of his life. We can also see in\
this example that unity does not mean\
9:48\
simply agreeing that everyone should\
do his or her own thing or go his\
9:52\
or her own way. We cannot be one unless\
we all bend our efforts to\
9:57\
the common cause. It means,\
in B. H. Roberts’ words,\
10:02\
submitting to the authority of God.\
10:05\
We are different members\
of the body of Christ,\
10:07\
fulfilling different functions\
at different times.\
10:10\
The ear, the eye, the head, the hand,\
the feet, yet all of one body.\
10:17\
Therefore, our goal is that there\
should be no schism in the body,\
10:20\
but that the members should have\
the same care one for another.\
10:24\
Unity does not require sameness,\
but it does require harmony.\
10:30\
We can have our hearts knit together in\
love, be one in faith and doctrine,\
10:35\
and still cheer for different teams or\
disagree on various political issues,\
10:40\
debate about goals and the right way to\
achieve them and many other such things.\
10:44\
But we can never disagree or contend\
with anger or contempt for one another.\
10:50\
Said the Savior, “For verily,\
10:53\
verily, I say unto you, he that hath the\
spirit of contention is not of me,\
10:57\
but is of the devil, who is\
the father of contention,\
11:01\
and he stirreth up the hearts of men to\
contend with anger, one with another.\
11:06\
Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir\
up the hearts of men with anger,\
11:11\
one against another; but this is my\
doctrine, that such things should be\
11:16\
done away.” A year ago, President\
Russell M. Nelson pled with us in these\
11:22\
words, “None of us can control\
nations or the actions of others\
11:27\
or even members of our own families.\
But we can control ourselves.\
11:33\
My call today, dear brothers\
and sisters,\
11:35\
is to end conflicts that are raging in\
your heart, your home, and your life.\
11:42\
Bury any and all inclinations\
to hurt others—\
11:45\
whether those inclinations be\
a temper, a sharp tongue,\
11:49\
or a resentment for someone\
who has hurt you.\
11:53\
The Savior commanded us to\
turn the other cheek,\
11:56\
to love our enemies, and to pray\
for those who despitefully use us.”\
12:03\
I say again that it is only in and\
through our individual loyalty to\
12:09\
and love of Jesus Christ that we can\
hope to be one. One within, one at home,\
12:18\
one in the Church, eventually\
one in Zion, and above all,\
12:24\
one with the Father and the\
Son and the Holy Ghost.\
12:29\
I returned to the events\
of Holy Week and\
12:31\
the ultimate triumph of our Redeemer,\
12:34\
the Resurrection of Jesus Christ\
bears witness of His divinity\
12:39\
and that He has overcome all things.\
12:41\
His Resurrection bears witness that,\
bound to Him by covenant,\
12:45\
we too may overcome all\
things and become one.\
12:49\
His Resurrection bears witness\
that through Him,\
12:52\
immortality and eternal\
life are realities.\
12:57\
This morning I bear witness of\
His literal Resurrection\
13:00\
and all that it implies, in the\
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\
