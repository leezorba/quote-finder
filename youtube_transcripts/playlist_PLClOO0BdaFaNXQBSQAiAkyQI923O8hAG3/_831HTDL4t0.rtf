The last time I spoke in general\
conference, my son-in-law, Ryan,\
0:06\
showed me a tweet that said, “Really?\
0:09\
The guy’s name is Bragg,\
meaning to boast,\
0:12\
and he doesn’t talk about humility?\
What a waste!”\
0:17\
Well, sadly, the disappointment\
continues.\
0:21\
My wonderful father was an all-American\
basketball player\
0:25\
for UCLA under legendary\
coach John Wooden.\
0:28\
They remained close throughout\
my father’s life,\
0:31\
and occasionally Coach and Mrs. Wooden\
would come to our home for dinner.\
0:35\
He was always happy to talk to me about\
basketball or anything else\
0:39\
on my mind. Once I asked him what\
advice he had for me as\
0:43\
I entered my senior year of high school.\
Always the teacher, he said,\
0:48\
“Your father told me that you’ve joined\
the Church of Jesus Christ,\
0:52\
so I know that you have\
faith in the Lord.\
0:55\
With that faith, be sure to have\
poise in every situation.\
1:00\
Be a good man in a storm.”\
Over the years.\
1:04\
That conversation stuck with me,\
that counsel to be calm,\
1:08\
cool, and collected in all situations,\
1:11\
particularly in times of adversity\
and pressure resonated with me.\
1:15\
I could see how Coach Wooden's\
teams played with poise and\
1:18\
the great success that they experienced\
winning ten national championships.\
1:23\
But poise isn’t spoken\
about much these days\
1:26\
and practiced even less in turbulent\
and divisive times.\
1:30\
It’s often referenced in sports—a player\
with poise is unflappable in\
1:36\
a close game or a team unravels\
due to a lack of poise.\
1:41\
But this wonderful quality\
goes way beyond sports.\
1:44\
Poise has a much broader application to\
life and can bless parents\
1:50\
and leaders, missionaries, teachers,\
1:53\
students, and everyone else facing\
the storms of life.\
1:57\
Spiritual poise blesses us to stay calm\
and focused on what matters most,\
2:03\
especially when we're under pressure.\
2:05\
President Hugh B. Brown taught,\
“Faith in God and in\
2:09\
the ultimate triumph of right,\
contributes to mental\
2:12\
and spiritual poise in the\
face of difficulties.”\
2:16\
President Russell M. Nelson is a\
wonderful example of spiritual poise.\
2:22\
One time, while performing a quadruple\
coronary artery bypass,\
2:26\
the patient's blood pressure\
dropped suddenly.\
2:29\
Dr. Nelson calmly assessed the\
situation and identified that\
2:33\
a clamp was accidentally removed\
by one of the team members.\
2:37\
It was replaced immediately, and Dr.\
Nelson comforted the team member,\
2:40\
saying, “I still love you.”\
And then added jokingly,\
2:44\
“Sometimes I love you more\
than other times.”\
2:47\
But he showed how an emergency should\
be handled—with poise focused\
2:52\
on what matters most—addressing\
the emergency.\
2:55\
President Nelson said, “It’s a matter\
of extreme self-discipline.\
3:00\
Your natural reaction is, ‘Take me out,\
coach! I want to go home.’\
3:04\
But of course you can't. A life\
is totally dependent on\
3:07\
the whole surgical team, so you've got\
to stay just as calm and relaxed\
3:12\
and sharp as you ever were.” End quote.\
3:16\
Of course, the Savior is the ultimate\
example of poise. In\
3:21\
the Garden of Gethsemane,\
3:22\
in unimaginable agony as “he sweat,\
as it were, great drops of blood,”\
3:27\
He exemplified divine poise with the\
simple yet majestic statement,\
3:33\
“Not my will, but thine be done.”\
3:37\
Under the immense pressure to enable\
the salvation of all mankind,\
3:41\
Jesus demonstrated three important\
conditions that help us understand His\
3:46\
great poise. First, He knew who He was\
and was true to His divine mission.\
3:52\
Next, He knew that there was\
a great plan of happiness.\
3:56\
And finally, He knew that through\
His infinite Atonement,\
4:00\
all who faithfully yoke themselves\
to Him by making\
4:04\
and keeping sacred covenants received\
through priesthood ordinances will be\
4:08\
saved, as was so beautifully taught\
by Elder Renlund today. To contrast\
4:13\
the difference between losing\
and maintaining poise,\
4:16\
think about what happened as Christ\
and His apostles left the\
4:19\
Garden of Gethsemane. When confronted\
by soldiers to arrest Jesus,\
4:24\
Peter's reaction was to lose his poise\
and lash out violently by cutting off\
4:29\
the ear of the high priest’s servant,\
Malchus.\
4:32\
But Jesus Christ's reaction,\
on the other hand,\
4:35\
was to keep His poise and to bring calm\
to a tense situation by healing Malchus.\
4:41\
And for those of us who struggle\
with maintaining our poise\
4:45\
or perhaps have grown discouraged,\
consider the rest of Peter's story.\
4:50\
A short time after this incident and\
4:52\
the heartbreak of denying his\
association with Christ,\
4:55\
he stood before the very same religious\
leaders who condemned the Savior\
5:00\
and with great poise, under\
intense questioning,\
5:04\
he bore eloquent testimony of the\
divinity of Jesus Christ.\
5:09\
Let’s consider elements of Christlike\
poise. To begin, knowing who we are\
5:14\
and being true to our\
divine identity brings calm.\
5:20\
Christlike poise requires that we avoid\
comparing ourselves to others\
5:24\
or pretending to be someone we’re not.\
Joseph Smith taught,\
5:28\
“If men do not comprehend\
the character of God,\
5:31\
they do not comprehend themselves.”\
End quote.\
5:35\
It's just not possible to have divine\
poise without knowing that we are\
5:40\
divine sons and daughters of\
a loving, Heavenly Father.\
5:44\
In his talk “Choices for Eternity,”\
5:47\
President Nelson taught these eternal\
truths about who we are:\
5:50\
We are children of God. We are\
children of the covenant.\
5:55\
And we are disciples of Christ.\
5:58\
He then promised, quote, “As\
you embrace these truths,\
6:02\
our Heavenly Father will help you reach\
your ultimate goal of living eternally\
6:07\
in His holy presence.” End quote.\
6:11\
We truly are divine spiritual beings,\
having a mortal experience.\
6:16\
Knowing who we are and being true to\
that divine identity are foundational\
6:21\
to the development of Christlike poise.\
6:24\
Next, remembering that there is a\
grand plan engenders courage\
6:29\
and poise in challenging conditions.\
6:32\
Nephi could “go and do” as\
the Lord commanded,\
6:35\
“not knowing beforehand” the\
things that he was to do\
6:38\
because he knew that he would be led\
by the Spirit in fulfillment of\
6:42\
the eternal plan of a loving,\
Heavenly Father.\
6:46\
Poise comes when we see things\
from an eternal perspective.\
6:51\
The Lord has counseled His disciples\
to “lift up your eyes” and “let\
6:55\
the solemnities of eternity rest upon\
your minds.” By framing challenging\
7:01\
times within an eternal plan, pressure\
becomes a privilege to love, serve,\
7:07\
teach, and bless. An eternal view\
enables Christlike poise.\
7:14\
And finally, the enabling power of\
Christ made possible by His atoning\
7:19\
sacrifice gives us the strength\
to endure and prevail.\
7:24\
Because of Jesus Christ, we\
can covenant with God\
7:27\
and be strengthened in keeping\
that covenant.\
7:29\
We can be bound to the Savior in joy\
7:32\
and calm regardless of our\
temporal circumstances.\
7:37\
Alma chapter 7 teaches beautifully\
about Christ’s enabling power. In\
7:42\
addition to redeeming us from sin,\
7:44\
the Savior can strengthen\
us in our weaknesses,\
7:47\
fears, and challenges in this life.\
7:50\
As we focus on Christ, we can hush our\
fears, as Alma’s people did in Helam.\
7:57\
As threatening armies gathered, those\
faithful disciples of Christ\
8:01\
demonstrated poise. Elder David\
A. Bednar has taught, quote,\
8:05\
“Alma counseled the believers\
to remember the Lord and\
8:09\
the deliverance only He could bestow.\
And knowledge of the Savior’s\
8:13\
protecting watchcare enabled the\
people to hush their own fears.”\
8:18\
End quote. This exemplifies poise.\
8:23\
Noah taught us much about\
patience in a storm,\
8:27\
but the Savior was the greatest teacher\
on how to survive a storm.\
8:31\
He is the great man in a storm.\
8:34\
After a long day of teaching\
with His Apostles,\
8:37\
the Savior needed some rest\
8:39\
and suggested that they cross by boat to\
the other side of the Sea of Galilee.\
8:44\
As the Savior rested, a severe\
storm arose and the wind\
8:48\
and waves threatened to sink the boat.\
8:51\
The Apostles began to fear\
for their lives.\
8:54\
And remember, several of those Apostles\
were fishermen who were very well\
8:58\
acquainted with the storms on that sea,\
9:00\
yet worried, they woke the Lord\
9:03\
and asked, “[Lord], carest thou\
not that we perish?”\
9:07\
Then, with exemplary poise,\
9:10\
the Savior “arose, and rebuked the wind,\
and said unto the sea, Peace, be still.\
9:18\
And the wind ceased, and there\
was ... great calm.” And then\
9:24\
a great lesson in poise\
for His Apostles.\
9:27\
He asked, “Why are ye so fearful?\
How is it that ye have no faith?”\
9:32\
Well, He was reminding them that\
He was the Savior of the world\
9:36\
and that He was sent by the Father\
to bring to pass the immortality\
9:40\
and eternal life of God's children.\
9:43\
Surely the Son of God would\
not perish on a boat.\
9:48\
He exemplified divine poise because\
He knew of His divinity,\
9:52\
and He knew that there was a plan\
of salvation and exaltation\
9:56\
and how essential His Atonement would be\
to the eternal success of that plan.\
10:03\
It is through Christ and His Atonement\
that all good things come into our\
10:08\
lives. As we remember who we are,\
10:12\
knowing that there is a divine plan\
of mercy and drawing courage in\
10:17\
the strength of the Lord, we can do\
all things. We will find calm.\
10:23\
We will be good women and\
men in any storm.\
10:28\
May we seek the blessings\
of Christlike poise,\
10:31\
not only to help ourselves\
in challenging times,\
10:35\
but to bless others and help them\
through the storms in their lives.\
10:41\
On this eve of Palm Sunday, I joyfully\
testify of Jesus Christ. He is risen.\
10:49\
I testify of the peace, calm,\
10:53\
and heavenly poise that only He\
brings to our lives and do\
10:57\
so in His holy name, Jesus Christ, amen.\
