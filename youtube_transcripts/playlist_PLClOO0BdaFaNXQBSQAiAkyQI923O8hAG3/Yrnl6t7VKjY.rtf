In my mind’s eye, I see the aging\
prophet Nephi at his desk,\
0:08\
the plates of gold spread before him,\
his stylus in hand.\
0:13\
Nephi was in the process of finishing\
his last engraving\
0:17\
on the record. He wrote. “And now,\
my beloved brethren,\
0:21\
I make an end of my sayings.”\
0:23\
But soon after, the Spirit urged Nephi\
to return to his record and write\
0:29\
a concluding message. Under\
the powerful influence of\
0:32\
the Holy Ghost, that great prophet\
took his stylus again in hand and wrote,\
0:37\
“Wherefore the things ... I have\
written sufficeth me, save it\
0:43\
be a few words ... I must speak\
concerning the doctrine of Christ.”\
0:48\
How eternally grateful we are\
for those “few words” and for\
0:54\
the Spirit compelling\
Nephi to write them.\
0:57\
Nephi’s treatise on the\
doctrine of Christ is\
1:00\
a treasure to those who feast upon it.\
1:03\
It contains a vision of the Savior’s\
baptism and the voice of the Son\
1:07\
inviting all to follow Him and “do the\
things which [we] have seen [Him] do.”\
1:13\
It contains Nephi's witness that those\
who, with faith in Christ,\
1:18\
sincerely repent of their sins\
and follow the Savior into\
1:22\
the waters of baptism will\
“receive the Holy Ghost.”\
1:26\
We also hear the voice of the\
Father bearing record: “Yea,\
1:30\
the words of my Beloved\
are true and faithful.\
1:34\
He that endureth to the end,\
the same shall be saved.”\
1:38\
President Russell M. Nelson emphasized\
the singular importance of\
1:43\
the doctrine of Christ during\
remarks to newly called mission leaders.\
1:48\
Quote: “More than anything else,\
1:50\
we want our missionaries to have\
1:53\
the doctrine of Christ engraved\
in their hearts—\
1:56\
rooted in the marrow of their bones,”\
end quote. Preach My Gospel\
2:01\
summarizes five important elements\
of the doctrine of Christ.\
2:05\
It says, quote, “[We] invite others to\
come unto Christ by helping them\
2:10\
receive the restored gospel through\
faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement,\
2:15\
repentance, baptism, receiving\
the gift of\
2:19\
the Holy Ghost, and enduring\
to the end,” end quote.\
2:23\
But the importance of the doctrine of\
Christ is not just for missionaries!\
2:28\
And it is much more profound than\
2:31\
a mere summary repetition of\
its five key elements.\
2:34\
It encompasses the law of the gospel. It\
is the great plan for eternal life.\
2:41\
Brothers and sisters, if we are to\
accept President Nelson's invitation to\
2:46\
have the doctrine of Christ rooted\
in the marrow of our bones,\
2:51\
we must deepen our conversion to\
the Lord by study, prayer,\
2:56\
faithful living,\
and continual repentance.\
2:59\
We must invite the Holy Ghost to engrave\
the doctrine of Christ in\
3:04\
the “fleshy tables of [our]\
heart[s]” as permanently\
3:08\
as it was engraved by Nephi\
upon the plates of gold.\
3:12\
Last October, President Nelson asked,\
3:15\
“What does it mean to\
overcome the world?”\
3:18\
Among other things, he said,\
3:20\
“It means trusting the doctrine\
of Christ more than the\
3:23\
philosophies of men.” The word “trust”\
is defined as “an assured reliance\
3:29\
on the character, ability, strength,\
or truth of someone or something.”\
3:35\
That someone is Jesus Christ and\
that something is His doctrine.\
3:41\
So how would intentionally trusting\
the doctrine of Christ change\
3:46\
the way we live our lives?\
3:48\
If we trust the doctrine of Christ,\
3:50\
we will trust Christ enough\
to live by His every word.\
3:55\
We will make a lifelong study of Jesus\
Christ, His ministry, His teachings,\
4:00\
His infinite Atonement, including\
His glorious Resurrection.\
4:04\
We will study His promises and\
4:06\
the conditions upon which those promises\
are given. As we study,\
4:11\
we will be filled with greater\
love for the Lord. If we trust\
4:15\
the doctrine of Christ, we will approach\
our Heavenly Father every day\
4:20\
in humble, secret prayer,\
4:22\
where we can express gratitude\
for the gift of His Son and\
4:25\
for all of our blessings.\
4:27\
We can pray for the revelatory\
companionship of the Holy Ghost,\
4:31\
pray to align our will with His,\
4:33\
to reflect upon our covenants and renew\
our commitment to keep them.\
4:39\
We can pray to sustain and express love\
for our prophets, seers, and revelators;\
4:45\
to pray for the cleansing power\
of forgiveness and for\
4:49\
the strength to resist temptation.\
4:52\
I invite you to make prayer\
a priority in your life,\
4:55\
seeking each day to improve your\
communication with God.\
4:59\
If we trust the doctrine of Christ,\
5:01\
we will set aside the\
shiny things of the world\
5:05\
so that we can focus on the\
Redeemer of the world.\
5:08\
We will limit or eliminate time spent\
on social media; digital games;\
5:13\
wasteful, excessive, or inappropriate\
entertainment;\
5:17\
the allure of this world’s\
treasures and vanities;\
5:20\
and any other activities that give\
place to the false traditions\
5:25\
and misguided philosophies of men.\
5:28\
It is only in Christ we find truth\
and lasting fulfillment.\
5:33\
Sincere repentance will become\
a joyful part of our lives,\
5:36\
both to be forgiven for sin and to be\
changed in the image of Christ.\
5:43\
Repentance with faith in Christ gives us\
access to the Atonement of Christ.\
5:48\
President Dallin H. Oaks has taught\
that when the Savior forgives,\
5:52\
“He does more than cleanse us from sin,\
5:55\
He also gives us new strength,”\
end quote.\
5:57\
Each one of us needs this\
strength to fulfill\
6:00\
the eternal purpose of our lives.\
6:02\
In Jesus and His doctrine, we\
find strength. He said,\
6:07\
“Verily, verily, I say unto you\
that this is my doctrine,\
6:10\
and whoso buildeth upon this,\
buildeth upon my rock and\
6:14\
the gates of hell shall not\
prevail against them.”\
6:17\
We see this promise fulfilled in\
the lives of faithful people.\
6:20\
It was a little over a year ago that\
I was privileged to meet Travis\
6:24\
and Kacie. They were married\
civilly in 2007.\
6:28\
At the time, Travis was not\
a member of the Church.\
6:31\
Kacie, though raised in an active\
Latter-day Saint home,\
6:35\
had drifted from her faith in her teens\
6:38\
and had strayed from her\
foundation. In 2018\
6:42\
Travis met the missionaries\
and was baptized in 2019.\
6:47\
Travis became a missionary to Kacie,\
6:50\
who also experienced a life-\
changing conversion.\
6:53\
They were sealed in the temple\
in September 2020.\
6:56\
About two years after his baptism,\
6:59\
Travis was called to serve\
in the bishopric.\
7:02\
Travis has a rare disease that\
continuously forms clusters of tumors\
7:07\
in his internal organs. He has undergone\
many surgeries to remove\
7:11\
recurring tumors, but the\
disease is incurable.\
7:15\
Several years ago, Travis was given\
fewer than ten years to live.\
7:19\
Kacie has retinitis pigmentosa,\
7:23\
a rare genetic disease that causes\
irreversible narrowing of\
7:27\
the field of vision until complete\
blindness sets in.\
7:31\
Kacie spoke to me of her future.\
7:33\
She anticipated the time, not far\
distant, when she would be widowed,\
7:38\
blind, without financial support,\
7:41\
and left alone to raise\
four growing children.\
7:45\
I asked Kacie how she could handle\
such a bleak future.\
7:49\
She smiled peacefully and said,\
7:51\
“I have never been more been happier\
or more hopeful in my life.\
7:57\
We hold to the promises we received in\
the temple.” Travis is now the bishop.\
8:03\
Two months ago he had another\
major surgery,\
8:06\
but he is optimistic and peaceful.\
Kacie’s vision is worsened.\
8:10\
She now has a guide dog and\
is unable to drive.\
8:13\
But she's content raising her children\
and serving as a counselor in\
8:17\
the Young Women’s presidency.\
8:19\
Travis and Kacie are building\
their house on the rock.\
8:26\
Travis and Kacie trust the\
doctrine of Christ and\
8:31\
the promise that God “shall consecrate\
[their] afflictions\
8:34\
for [their] gain.”\
In God’s perfect plan,\
8:37\
suffering with faith in Christ is linked\
to our becoming perfected in\
8:42\
Christ. Like the wise man in the parable\
“who built his house upon a rock,”\
8:46\
when the rain descends and the\
floods come and the winds blow\
8:51\
and beat upon the house Travis\
and Kacie are building,\
8:54\
it will fall not for it will\
be founded upon a rock.\
8:58\
Jesus did not speak of the possibility\
of rain and flood and wind in our lives;\
9:05\
He spoke of the certainty\
that storms will arise.\
9:08\
The variable in this parable is not\
whether storms will come, but how\
9:14\
we have responded to His loving\
invitation to both hear\
9:18\
and do what He has taught.\
9:20\
There is no other way to survive. When\
we have built our houses on\
9:25\
the foundation of a covenantal\
relationship with Christ,\
9:28\
we are trusting the doctrine of Christ.\
9:31\
And as we come unto Him, we have\
His promise of eternal life.\
9:35\
People who trust the doctrine\
of Christ endure to the end.\
9:39\
I bear my personal witness of\
9:42\
the living, resurrected reality\
of Jesus Christ.\
9:46\
I testify that God our Father\
so loved the world\
9:50\
He sent His Son to redeem us from\
sin and heal us from sorrow.\
9:56\
I testify that He has called a prophet\
of God in our time, even\
10:00\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
10:02\
through whom He speaks and guides\
us. With all my heart,\
10:05\
I invite you to trust the doctrine of\
Christ and build your lives upon\
10:10\
the rock of the Redeemer. He will never\
fail you. In the name of Jesus Christ,\
10:14\
Amen.\
