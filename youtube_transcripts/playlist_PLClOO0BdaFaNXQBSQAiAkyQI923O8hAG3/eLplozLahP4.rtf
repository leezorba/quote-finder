Dear brothers and sisters,\
0:04\
friends, welcome to general conference.\
0:08\
After general conference last October,\
0:11\
Sister Gong and I walked through the\
Conference Center to say hello\
0:15\
and to hear your gospel experiences.\
0:19\
Our members from Mexico said,\
“Hoy es el tiempo de México.”\
0:25\
We learned Gilly and Mary\
are friends from England.\
0:29\
When Mary joined the Church,\
she lost her place to live.\
0:33\
Gilly generously invited Mary to come\
live with her. Full of faith,\
0:39\
Gilly says, “I’ve never doubted the\
Lord is with me.” At conference,\
0:45\
Gilly also had a joyful reunion with\
0:48\
the sister missionary who baptized\
her 47 years ago.\
0:53\
Jeff and his wife, Melissa, were\
attending general conference for his\
0:58\
first time. Jeff played\
professional baseball.\
1:02\
He was a catcher and is now a\
physician anesthesiologist.\
1:07\
He told me, “Much to my surprise,\
1:11\
I’m moving toward baptism because\
it feels like the most authentic\
1:16\
and honest way to live.” Earlier,\
1:19\
Melissa had apologized to Jeff’s\
assigned ministering brother,\
1:23\
“Jeff does not want ‘white\
shirts’ in our house.”\
1:28\
The ministering brother said,\
“I’ll find a way.”\
1:32\
Now, he and Jeff are good friends.\
1:36\
At Jeff’s baptism, I met a congregation\
of Latter-day Saints\
1:40\
whom Jeff, Melissa, and their\
daughter, Charlotte, love.\
1:45\
As followers of Jesus Christ,\
1:48\
we seek to minister to\
others as He would\
1:52\
because lives are waiting to change.\
1:56\
When Peggy told me her husband, John,\
after 31 years of marriage,\
2:02\
was going to be baptized, I\
asked what had changed.\
2:07\
Peggy said, “John and I were studying\
the New Testament Come, Follow Me\
2:11\
and John asked about Church doctrine.”\
2:15\
Peggy said, “Let’s invite\
the missionaries.”\
2:18\
John said, “No missionaries ... unless\
my friend can come.”\
2:23\
Over ten years, John's ministering\
brother had become his trusted friend.\
2:29\
I thought, “What if John’s ministering\
brother had stopped coming after one,\
2:34\
two, or nine years?” John listened. He\
read the Book of Mormon with real\
2:42\
intent. When the missionaries invited\
John to be baptized, he said yes.\
2:47\
Peggy said, “I fell off my chair\
and started to cry.”\
2:52\
John said, “I changed as I drew\
closer to the Lord.”\
2:57\
Later, John and Peggy were sealed\
in the holy temple.\
3:01\
Last December, John passed\
away at age 92.\
3:05\
Peggy says, “John was always\
a good person,\
3:10\
but he became different in a beautiful\
way after he was baptized.”\
3:16\
Sister Gong and I met Meb and Jenny by\
video during the COVID pandemic.\
3:22\
We met many wonderful couples and\
individuals by video during COVID,\
3:26\
each prayerfully introduced\
by their stake president.\
3:30\
Meb and Jenny humbly said concerns in\
their lives made them wonder if their\
3:35\
temple marriage could be\
saved and, if so, how.\
3:39\
They believed Jesus Christ’s Atonement\
3:42\
and their covenant commitments\
could help them.\
3:45\
Imagine my joy when Meb and Jenny\
received new temple recommends\
3:50\
and returned together to the house of\
the Lord. Later, Meb almost died.\
3:56\
What a blessing Meb and Jenny had\
restored covenant relationships with\
4:01\
the Lord and each other and feel\
4:04\
the ministering love of\
many around them.\
4:07\
Everywhere I go, I gratefully learn\
from those who minister and care\
4:13\
as our Savior would. In Peru,\
4:17\
Sister Gong and I met Salvador\
and his siblings.\
4:21\
Salvador and his siblings are orphans.\
It was Salvador's birthday.\
4:27\
The Church leaders and members who\
faithfully ministered to this family\
4:31\
inspire me. “Pure religion and\
undefiled” is this—“to visit\
4:37\
the fatherless and widows,”\
“succor the weak,\
4:41\
lift up the hands which hang down, ...\
strengthen the feeble knees.”\
4:46\
In Hong Kong, an elders quorum president\
modestly shares how their\
4:51\
quorum consistently conducts 100%\
ministering interviews.\
4:56\
Quote: “We prayerfully organize\
companionships so everyone can care\
5:02\
for someone and be\
cared for,” he says.\
5:05\
“We regularly ask each companionship\
about those for whom they minister.\
5:11\
We do not check boxes. We minister to\
the ministers who care for our people,”\
5:17\
end quote. In Kinshasa, Democratic\
Republic of the Congo,\
5:23\
President Bokolo shares how he and his\
family joined the Church in France.\
5:28\
One day, as he was reading\
his patriarchal blessing,\
5:32\
the Spirit inspired Brother Bokolo\
to return with his family to\
5:36\
the DR Congo. Brother Bokolo knew they\
would face many challenges if they\
5:41\
returned, and their Church, The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\
5:47\
was not yet established in Kinshasa.\
5:50\
Yet in faith, as have many others,\
5:54\
the Bokolos followed\
the Lord’s Spirit.\
5:56\
In Kinshasa, they ministered to\
5:59\
and blessed those around them, overcame\
challenges, received spiritual\
6:05\
and temporal blessings. Today,\
6:08\
they rejoice in having a house\
of the Lord in their country.\
6:13\
A convert was ministered to by personal\
example. A as a young man,\
6:19\
he said he spent his days\
lounging at the beach.\
6:23\
One day he said, “I saw an attractive\
girl in a modest swimsuit.”\
6:30\
Amazed, he went to ask why such an\
attractive girl would wear such\
6:36\
a modest swimsuit. She was a member of\
6:40\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints and asked with a smile,\
6:45\
“Would you like to come to church\
Sunday?” He said yes.\
6:52\
Years ago, Elder L. Tom\
Perry shared how he\
6:55\
and his companion regularly ministered\
to a sister who lived alone in\
7:00\
a rough Boston neighborhood.\
7:03\
When Elder Perry and his\
companion arrived,\
7:06\
the sister cautiously directed, “Put\
your temple recommends under the door.”\
7:12\
Only after seeing the temple recommends\
would she unbolt multiple locks\
7:17\
and open the door. Of course,\
7:20\
I am not saying ministering\
companionships need temple recommends,\
7:25\
but I love the thought that\
7:27\
as those who honor covenants minister,\
hearts unlock and hearts open.\
7:36\
Elder Perry also offered practical\
advice: “Give companionships\
7:41\
a reasonable number of assignments\
prayerfully chosen,\
7:45\
clustered geographically\
where appropriate,\
7:47\
so travel time is used well,”\
7:49\
he would counsel. “Start with\
those who need visits.\
7:53\
Build from those most likely to welcome\
and respond well to visits.”\
7:59\
He concluded, “Faithful consistency\
brings miracles.” Higher\
8:06\
and holier ministering comes when we\
pray for the “pure love of Christ”\
8:12\
and follow the Spirit. It also comes\
8:15\
as elders quorum and Relief\
Society presidencies, under\
8:19\
the Bishop’s direction, oversee\
ministering efforts,\
8:23\
including assigning ministering\
companionships.\
8:27\
Please give our young men and young\
women needed opportunity to accompany\
8:33\
and be mentored by experienced\
ministering brothers and sisters.\
8:37\
And please let our young rising\
generation inspire ministering brother\
8:42\
and sister companions. In some\
places in the Church,\
8:47\
we have a ministering gap.\
8:50\
More say they are ministering than\
say they are being ministered to.\
8:57\
We do not want checklist concern,\
9:00\
but more often we need more than\
a sincere hello in the hall or\
9:05\
a casual “Can I help you?”\
in the parking lot.\
9:08\
In many places we can reach out,\
9:11\
understand others\
where they are,\
9:14\
and build relationships when we\
regularly visit members in their homes.\
9:20\
Inspired invitations change lives.\
9:24\
When invitations help us make\
and keep sacred covenants,\
9:28\
we draw closer to the\
Lord and each other.\
9:33\
It is said that those who understand\
9:34\
the true spirit of ministering\
do more than before,\
9:39\
while those who do not understand do\
less. Let’s do more as our Savior would.\
9:47\
As our hymn says, “It is a blessing of\
duty and love.” Ward councils, elders\
9:54\
quorum and Relief Societies,\
please hearken to\
9:57\
the Good Shepherd and help Him\
“seek that which was lost, ...\
10:02\
bring again that which was driven away,\
... bind up that which was broken,\
10:07\
... strengthen that which was sick.”\
10:10\
We may entertain “angels unawares”\
as we make room in His inn\
10:16\
for all. Inspired ministering blesses\
families and individuals,\
10:22\
it also strengthens wards and branches.\
10:27\
Think of your ward or branch\
as a spiritual ecosystem.\
10:31\
In the spirit of the Book of Mormon\
allegory of the olive trees,\
10:35\
the Lord of the vineyard and His\
servants bring forth precious fruit\
10:40\
and strengthen each tree by binding\
together the strength\
10:46\
and weaknesses of all the trees.\
10:49\
The Lord of the vineyard and His\
servants repeatedly ask,\
10:53\
“What more can I do?”\
10:56\
Together, they bless hearts and homes,\
10:58\
wards and branches through inspired,\
consistent ministering.\
11:06\
Ministering—shepherding—makes our\
vineyard one body, a sacred grove.\
11:14\
Each tree in our grove is a\
living family tree. Roots\
11:19\
and branches intertwine. Ministering\
blesses generations. When service is\
11:27\
needed, wise bishops, elders quorum,\
Relief Society presidencies\
11:31\
ask, “Who are the ministering\
companions?”\
11:35\
Ward councils and ministering interviews\
11:38\
ask not only about challenges\
or problems,\
11:42\
but also look with eyes\
to see and rejoice in\
11:47\
the Lord’s many tender\
mercies in our lives\
11:50\
as we minister as He would.Our\
Savior is our perfect example.\
11:57\
Because He is good, He can\
go about doing good.\
12:01\
He blesses the one and the 99.\
He is ministering personified.\
12:09\
We become more like Jesus Christ when\
we do unto the least of these\
12:14\
as we would unto Him, when we “love\
our neighbor as ourselves,”\
12:19\
when we “love one another,\
as I have loved you,”\
12:23\
and when “whosoever will be great among\
you, let him be your minister.”\
12:31\
Jesus Christ ministers. Angels\
minister.\
12:36\
Followers of Jesus Christ “minister\
one to another,” rejoice\
12:40\
with them that rejoice, and “weep\
with them that weep,” “watch\
12:45\
over ... and nourish [the people] with\
things pertaining to righteousness,”\
12:50\
“remember ... the poor and the needy,\
the sick and the afflicted.”\
12:54\
Let His name be known through\
our ministry.\
12:59\
As we minister as He would,\
we witness His miracles,\
13:03\
His blessings. We obtain\
“a more excellent ministry.”\
13:10\
We may tire physically. But in\
His service, we do “not weary\
13:15\
in well doing.” We\
diligently do our best,\
13:18\
do not run faster than we have strength,\
but trust,\
13:22\
as the Apostle Paul teaches, that “God\
loveth a cheerful giver.” For God\
13:29\
“ministereth seed to the sower\
13:31\
both minister bread for your food\
and multiply your seed sown.”\
13:36\
In other words, God enriches “every\
thing to all bountifulness.” They which\
13:43\
“soweth bountifully shall\
also reap bountifully.”\
13:47\
Wherever we are in this Easter season,\
13:50\
let us reach out and care\
as our Savior would,\
13:53\
especially to those whom we\
are privileged by love\
13:57\
and assignment to minister.\
13:59\
In so doing, may we draw closer\
to Jesus Christ and each other,\
14:05\
becoming more like Him and the\
followers of Jesus Christ\
14:09\
He would have us each be. In His sacred\
name, Jesus Christ, amen.\
