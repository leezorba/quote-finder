As announced, Jared B Larson will now\

0:20\
To the First Presidency of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
0:25\
Dear Brethren. Directed by revelation,\
0:28\
as recorded in Section 120 of\
the Doctrine and Covenants,\
0:32\
the council on the disposition\
of the tithes composed of\
0:35\
the First Presidency, the Quorum\
of the Twelve Apostles, and\
0:39\
the Presiding Bishopric authorizes\
the expenditure of Church funds.\
0:43\
Church entities disburse funds in\
accordance with approved budgets,\
0:47\
policies, and procedures.\
Church auditing,\
0:51\
which consists of credentialed\
professionals\
0:54\
and is independent of all other Church\
departments and entities,\
0:58\
has responsibility to\
perform audits for\
1:01\
the purpose of providing reasonable\
assurance regarding contributions\
1:05\
received, expenditures made,\
1:08\
and safeguarding of Church assets.\
Based upon audits performed,\
1:13\
Church auditing is of the opinion\
that in all material respects,\
1:17\
contributions received, expenditures\
made, and assets of the Church for\
1:22\
the year 2022 have been recorded\
1:26\
and administered in accordance\
with Church-approved budgets,\
1:29\
accounting practices, and policies.\
1:32\
The Church follows the practices taught\
to its members of living within\
1:36\
a budget, avoiding debt, and saving\
against a time of need.\
1:41\
Respectfully submitted, Church\
Auditing Department,\
1:44\
Jared B. Larson, Managing Director.\
