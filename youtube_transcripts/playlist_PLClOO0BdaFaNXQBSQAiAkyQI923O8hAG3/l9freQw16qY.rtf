Elder George A. Smith, an Apostle,\
0:04\
received counsel from the\
prophet Joseph Smith at\
0:08\
a time of great difficulty: “He told\
me I should never get discouraged,\
0:13\
whatever difficulties might surround\
me. If I was sunk in\
0:17\
the lowest pit of Nova Scotia and\
all the Rocky Mountains piled\
0:22\
on top of me, I ought not to be\
discouraged, but hang on,\
0:27\
exercise faith, keep up good courage,\
0:30\
and I should come out on top\
of the heap at last.”\
0:35\
How could the Prophet Joseph say that\
to someone who is suffering?\
0:42\
Because he knew it was true.\
He lived it.\
0:47\
Joseph repeatedly experienced severe\
difficulties in his life.\
0:52\
However, as he exercised faith in\
Jesus Christ and His Atonement\
0:57\
and just kept going, he overcame\
seemingly insurmountable obstacles.\
1:04\
Today, I would like to\
renew Joseph’s plea\
1:07\
not to let discouragement overwhelm\
us when we face disappointment,\
1:12\
painful experiences, our own\
inadequacies, or other challenges.\
1:18\
When I say “discouragement,”\
1:20\
I'm not talking about the more\
debilitating challenges of clinical\
1:24\
depression, anxiety disorder,\
1:26\
or other illnesses that require\
special treatment.\
1:30\
I'm just talking about plain old\
discouragement that comes with the ups\
1:35\
and downs in life. I am inspired by my\
heroes who just keep going with faith\
1:43\
no matter what. In the Book of Mormon,\
we read of Zoram, the servant of Laban.\
1:50\
When Nephi obtained the brass plates,\
1:53\
Zoram was faced with the choice to\
follow Nephi and his brothers into\
1:57\
the wilderness, or possibly lose\
his life. What a choice!\
2:03\
Zoram’s first inclination was to run,\
2:06\
but Nephi held him and made an oath\
that if he would go with them,\
2:10\
he would be free and have a\
place with their family.\
2:14\
Zoram took courage and went with them.\
2:18\
Zoram suffered afflictions\
in his new life,\
2:20\
yet he pressed forward with faith.\
2:23\
We have no indication that\
Zoram clung to his past\
2:27\
or harbored resentment toward\
God or others.\
2:31\
He was a true friend of Nephi,\
a prophet,\
2:34\
and he and his seed dwelled in freedom\
and prosperity in the promised land.\
2:40\
What had been a huge obstacle in Zoram’s\
path eventually led to rich\
2:46\
blessings due to his faithfulness\
2:49\
and willingness to just\
keep going with faith.\
2:54\
Recently, I listened to a courageous\
sister share how she persevered through\
2:59\
difficulties. She had some challenges,\
3:02\
and one Sunday she was sitting in\
Relief Society listening to\
3:06\
a teacher who she thought lived\
a picture-perfect life—\
3:09\
totally different from her own.\
She was tired and discouraged.\
3:14\
She felt like she didn’t measure\
up—or even belong—\
3:18\
so she got up and left, planning\
to never to return to church.\
3:23\
Walking to the car, she felt\
a distinct impression:\
3:27\
“Go into the chapel and listen to\
the sacrament meeting speaker.”\
3:32\
She questioned the prompting,\
but felt it again strongly.\
3:36\
So she went into the meeting. The\
message was exactly what she needed.\
3:42\
She felt the Spirit. She knew the Lord\
wanted her to stay with Him,\
3:47\
to be His disciple, and to attend\
church. And so she did.\
3:53\
Do you know what she was grateful for?\
That she didn't give up.\
3:58\
She just kept going with faith in Jesus\
Christ, even when it stretched her,\
4:04\
and she and her family are\
being abundantly blessed\
4:08\
as she presses forward.\
The God of heaven\
4:12\
and earth will help us overcome\
discouragement\
4:15\
and whatever obstacles we encounter,\
if we look to Him,\
4:19\
follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost,\
and just keep going with faith.\
4:26\
Thankfully, when we are\
weak or incapable,\
4:29\
the Lord can strengthen our faith.\
4:31\
He can increase our capacity\
beyond our own.\
4:35\
I have experienced that. More\
than 20 years ago,\
4:39\
I was unexpectedly called as an Area\
Seventy, and I felt very inadequate.\
4:45\
Following my training assignments,\
4:47\
I was to preside at my first\
stake conference.\
4:51\
The stake president and I meticulously\
planned every detail.\
4:56\
Shortly before the conference,\
President Boyd K. Packer,\
5:00\
then Acting President of the\
Quorum of Twelve Apostles,\
5:03\
called to see if he could accompany me.\
I was surprised and of course agreed.\
5:09\
I asked how he would like to proceed\
since he would preside.\
5:13\
He suggested that we undo the plans\
and prepare to follow the Spirit.\
5:21\
Thankfully, I still had\
ten days to study,\
5:24\
pray, and prepare. With an open agenda,\
5:28\
we were on the stand 20 minutes before\
the leadership meeting began.\
5:32\
I leaned over to the stake\
president and whispered,\
5:36\
“This is a wonderful stake.”\
5:38\
President Packer elbowed me gently\
and said, “No talking.”\
5:47\
I stopped talking and his general\
conference talk “Reverence Invites\
5:54\
Revelation” came to mind. I observed\
that President Packer was writing down\
5:59\
references. The Spirit confirmed to me\
that he was receiving impressions\
6:04\
for the meeting. My learning\
experience had just begun.\
6:08\
President Packer spoke for the first\
15 minutes and emphasized\
6:12\
the importance of conducting all\
meetings as guided by the Holy Spirit.\
6:18\
He then said, “We’ll now\
hear from Elder Cook.”\
6:21\
On my way to the pulpit, I asked how\
long he would like me to take\
6:25\
and if there was a topic he\
would like me to address.\
6:28\
He said, “Take 15 minutes and carry\
on as you feel inspired.”\
6:33\
I took 14 minutes and shared everything\
I had on my mind.\
6:38\
President Packer stood again and\
spoke for another 15 minutes\
6:43\
and shared this scripture:\
6:45\
“Speak the thoughts that I shall\
put into your hearts,\
6:48\
and you shall not be confounded\
before men;\
6:51\
for it will be given you ... in the\
very moment what ye shall say.”\
6:57\
He then said, “We will now hear from\
Elder Cook.” I was shocked!\
7:03\
I had never considered\
the possibility that\
7:06\
I would be asked to speak\
twice in one meeting.\
7:10\
I didn’t have anything to say in mind.\
7:13\
Praying fervently and relying\
on the Lord for help,\
7:16\
somehow I was blessed with\
a scripture, a thought,\
7:20\
and I was able to speak for 15 minutes.\
But I sat down totally exhausted.\
7:26\
President Packer spoke for 15 minutes\
about following the Spirit,\
7:30\
and shared Paul’s teachings that we\
should not speak “words which man’s\
7:35\
wisdom teacheth, but which\
the Holy Ghost teacheth.”\
7:39\
As you can imagine, I was overwhelmed\
when he said\
7:43\
for the third time, “We’ll now\
hear from Elder Cook.”\
7:48\
I was empty. I had nothing.\
7:54\
I knew it was time to\
exercise more faith.\
7:58\
Slowly, I made my way to the pulpit,\
pleading to God for help.\
8:04\
As I stepped up to the microphone,\
8:06\
the Lord miraculously blessed me to\
somehow give another 15-minute message.\
8:11\
The meeting finally ended,\
8:13\
but I quickly realized that the adult\
session would start in an hour. Oh no!\
8:22\
Like Zoram, I sincerely wanted to run.\
8:24\
But just as Nephi caught him, I knew\
President Packer would catch me.\
8:33\
The adult meeting followed\
the very same pattern.\
8:37\
I spoke three more times. The next\
day during the general session,\
8:43\
I spoke once. After the conference,\
8:46\
President Packer said with affection,\
“Let’s do it again sometime.”\
8:56\
I love President Boyd K. Packer and\
appreciate all that I learned.\
9:02\
Do you know what I'm grateful for?\
9:07\
That I didn't give up or resist.\
9:12\
If I had given in to my desperate desire\
to escape from those meetings,\
9:16\
I would have missed an opportunity\
to increase my faith,\
9:20\
to receive a rich outpouring of love and\
support from my Heavenly Father.\
9:25\
I learned of His mercy, the miraculous\
enabling power of Jesus Christ,\
9:31\
His Atonement, and the powerful\
influence of the Holy Ghost.\
9:35\
In spite of my weakness, I\
learned that I can serve;\
9:39\
I can contribute when the\
Lord is by my side\
9:43\
if I just keep going with faith.\
Regardless of the size,\
9:49\
scope, and serious challenges\
we face in life,\
9:52\
we all have times when we feel like\
stopping, leaving, escaping,\
9:57\
or possibly giving up, but exercising\
faith in our Savior Jesus Christ helps\
10:04\
us overcome discouragement, no matter\
what obstacles we encounter.\
10:10\
Just as the Savior finished the\
work He was given to do,\
10:14\
He has the power to help us finish\
the work we have been given.\
10:19\
We can be blessed to move forward\
along the covenant path,\
10:23\
no matter how rocky it becomes, and\
eventually receive eternal life.\
10:29\
As the Prophet Joseph Smith said,\
“Stand fast, ye Saints of God,\
10:35\
hold on a little while longer and\
the storm of life will be past,\
10:41\
and you will be rewarded by that\
God whose servants you are.”\
10:46\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
