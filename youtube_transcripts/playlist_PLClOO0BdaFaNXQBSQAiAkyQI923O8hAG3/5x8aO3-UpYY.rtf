We believe in Christ.\
0:06\
As members of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints,\
0:11\
we worship Him and follow His teachings\
in the scriptures. Before the fall,\
0:20\
our Heavenly Father spoke directly\
to Adam and Eve.\
0:25\
Thereafter, the Father introduced His\
Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ,\
0:31\
as our Savior and Redeemer and gave\
us the command to “hear Him.”\
0:40\
From this direction, we conclude that\
0:43\
the scriptural records of words spoken\
by “God” or the “Lord” are almost always\
0:50\
the words of Jehovah, our\
risen Lord, Jesus Christ.\
0:57\
We are given the scriptures\
to direct our lives.\
1:02\
As the prophet Nephi taught us, we\
should “feast upon the words of Christ;\
1:08\
for behold, the words of Christ will\
tell you all things that ye should do.”\
1:16\
Most of the scriptures reporting Jesus’s\
mortal ministries are descriptions\
1:22\
of what He did. My message today\
consists of a selection of\
1:30\
the words of our Savior—what He said.\
1:35\
These are words recorded\
in the New Testament\
1:38\
(including the inspired additions of\
Joseph Smith) and in the Book of Mormon.\
1:46\
Most of these selections are in\
1:48\
the sequence in which our\
Savior spoke them.\
1:55\
“Verily, verily, I say unto thee,\
1:58\
Except a man be born of water\
and of the Spirit,\
2:02\
he cannot enter into\
the kingdom of God.”\
2:07\
“Blessed are ... they [which] do hunger\
and thirst after righteousness:\
2:12\
for they shall be filled\
with the Holy Ghost.”\
2:18\
“Blessed are the peacemakers: for they\
shall be called the children of God.”\
2:25\
“Ye have heard that it was\
said by them of old time,\
2:29\
Thou shalt not commit adultery:\
2:31\
But I say unto you, That\
whosoever looketh on\
2:35\
a woman to lust after her hath committed\
adultery with her already in\
2:41\
his heart.”\
2:45\
“Ye have heard that it hath been said,\
2:47\
Thou shalt love thy neighbor,\
and hate thine enemy.\
2:52\
But I say unto you, Love your enemies,\
2:56\
bless them that curse\
you, do good to them\
3:00\
that hate you, and pray for them which\
despitefully use you, and persecute you;\
3:07\
That ye may be the children of your\
Father which is in heaven;\
3:12\
for he maketh his sun to rise\
on the evil and on the good,\
3:17\
and sendeth rain on the just\
and on the unjust.”\
3:25\
“If ye forgive men their trespasses,\
3:28\
your heavenly Father will\
also forgive you:\
3:31\
But if ye forgive not men their\
trespasses, neither will your Father\
3:37\
forgive your trespasses.”\
3:43\
“If ye were of the world, the\
world would love his own:\
3:48\
but because ye are not of the world, but\
I have chosen you out of the world,\
3:54\
therefore the world hateth you.”\
4:00\
“Wherefore, seek not the\
things of this world\
4:04\
but seek ye first to build\
up the kingdom of God\
4:08\
and establish His righteousness;\
4:10\
and all these things shall\
be added unto you.”\
4:17\
“Therefore all things whatsoever ye\
would that men should do to you, do ye\
4:24\
even so to them: for this is\
the law and the prophets.”\
4:33\
“Beware of false prophets, which come\
to you in sheep’s clothing,\
4:37\
but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\
Ye shall know them by their fruits.\
4:44\
Do men gather grapes of thorns,\
or figs of thistles?\
4:51\
Even so, every good tree bringeth\
forth good fruit;\
4:56\
but a corrupt tree bringeth\
forth evil fruit.”\
5:02\
“Not everyone that saith\
unto me, Lord, Lord,\
5:06\
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven;\
5:08\
but He that doeth the will of my\
Father which is in heaven.”\
5:18\
“Come unto me, all ye that labor and are\
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\
5:25\
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;\
for I am meek and lowly in heart:\
5:32\
and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\
For my yoke is easy,\
5:38\
and my burden is light.”\
5:44\
“If any man will come after me,\
5:47\
let him deny himself, and take\
up his cross and follow me.\
5:53\
And now for a man to take up his cross,\
is to deny himself all ungodliness,\
5:59\
and every worldly lust, and\
keep my commandments.”\
6:07\
“Therefore forsake the world\
and save your souls;\
6:12\
for what is a man profited, if he\
shall gain the whole world,\
6:17\
and lose his own soul? Or what shall a\
man give in exchange for his soul?”\
6:28\
“If any man will do his will, he\
shall know of the doctrine,\
6:32\
whether it be of God, or whether\
I speak of myself.”\
6:40\
“And I say unto you, Ask, and\
it shall be given you;\
6:45\
seek, and ye shall find; knock, and\
it shall be opened unto you.\
6:52\
For every one that asketh receiveth;\
and he that seeketh findeth;\
6:59\
and to him that knocketh\
it shall be opened.”\
7:05\
“Other sheep I have, which are not of\
this fold; them also I must bring,\
7:11\
and they shall hear my voice; and there\
shall be one fold, and one shepherd.”\
7:21\
“Jesus said unto her, I am the\
resurrection, and the life:\
7:26\
he that believeth in me, though he\
were dead, yet shall he live:\
7:32\
And whosoever liveth and believeth\
in me shall never die.”\
7:42\
“[The great commandment in the\
law is this,] Thou shalt love\
7:45\
the Lord thy God with all thy\
heart, and with all thy soul,\
7:51\
and with all thy mind. This is the\
first and great commandment.\
7:58\
And the second is like unto it, thou\
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\
8:05\
On these two commandments hang\
all the law and the prophets.”\
8:13\
“He that hath my commandments,\
and keepeth them,\
8:17\
he it is that loveth me: and he that\
loveth me shall be loved of my Father,\
8:25\
and I will love him, and will\
manifest myself to him.”\
8:32\
“Peace I leave with you, my peace\
8:37\
give I unto you: not as the world\
giveth, give I unto you.\
8:44\
Let not your heart be troubled, neither\
let it be afraid.”\
8:52\
“This is my commandment, That ye love\
one another as I have loved you.”\
9:02\
“Behold my hands and my feet, that it is\
I myself: handle me, and see,\
9:10\
for a spirit hath not flesh and\
bones, as ye see me have.”\
9:18\
“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,\
baptizing them in the name of\
9:24\
the Father, and of the Son,\
and of the Holy Ghost:\
9:29\
Teaching them to observe\
all things whatsoever\
9:32\
I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with\
you alway, even unto the end of\
9:40\
the world.”\
9:45\
After His ministry in the Holy Land,\
9:47\
Jesus Christ appeared to the righteous\
on the American continent.\
9:52\
These are some of the words\
He spoke there.\
9:58\
“Behold, I am Jesus Christ\
the Son of God.\
10:02\
I created the heavens and the earth,\
and all things that in them are.\
10:07\
I was with the Father\
from the beginning.\
10:10\
I am in the Father, and the\
Father in me; and in me\
10:15\
hath the Father glorified his name.”\
10:20\
“I am the light and the life of the\
world. I am Alpha and Omega,\
10:26\
the beginning and the end.”\
10:31\
“And ye shall offer up unto me no\
more the shedding of blood; yea,\
10:35\
your sacrifices and your burnt\
offerings shall be done away,\
10:41\
for I will accept none of your\
sacrifices and your burnt offerings.\
10:47\
And ye shall offer for\
a sacrifice unto me\
10:50\
a broken heart and a contrite spirit.\
10:54\
And whoso cometh unto me with a broken\
heart and a contrite spirit,\
10:59\
him will I baptize with fire\
and with the Holy Ghost.”\
11:07\
“Behold, I have come unto the world to\
bring redemption unto the world,\
11:12\
to save the world from sin.”\
11:18\
“And again I say unto you,\
11:20\
ye must repent, and be baptized in my\
name, and become as a little child,\
11:27\
or ye can in no wise inherit\
the kingdom of God.”\
11:33\
“Therefore I would that ye should be\
perfect even as I, or your Father\
11:39\
who is in heaven is perfect.”\
11:44\
“Verily, verily, I say unto\
you, ye must watch\
11:48\
and pray always, lest ye be\
tempted by the devil,\
11:52\
and ye be led away captive by him.”\
11:57\
“Therefore, ye must always pray\
unto the Father in my name.”\
12:03\
“Therefore, whatsoever ye shall do,\
ye shall do it in my name;\
12:09\
therefore ye shall call\
the church in my name.”\
12:16\
“Behold, I have given\
unto you my gospel,\
12:19\
and this is the gospel which I have\
given unto you—that I came into\
12:24\
the world to do the will of my Father,\
because my Father sent me.\
12:30\
And my Father sent me that I might\
be lifted up upon the cross;\
12:35\
and after that I had been\
lifted up upon the cross, that\
12:39\
I might draw all men unto me, ... to\
be judged of their works,\
12:45\
whether they be good or\
whether they be evil.”\
12:51\
“Now this is the commandment: Repent\
all ye ends of the earth,\
12:56\
and come unto me and be\
baptized in my name,\
13:00\
that ye may be sanctified by the\
reception of the Holy Ghost,\
13:05\
that ye may stand spotless before\
me at the last day.”\
13:14\
We believe in Christ. I conclude with\
what He said about how we should know\
13:22\
and follow His teachings:\
13:26\
“But the Comforter, which\
is the Holy Ghost,\
13:29\
whom the Father will send in my name,\
13:32\
he shall teach you all things,\
13:35\
and bring all things to your\
remembrance, whatsoever\
13:40\
I have said unto you.” I affirm the\
truth of these teachings in\
13:47\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
