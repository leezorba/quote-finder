You likely remember hearing\
a letter from\
0:04\
the First Presidency read in your\
ward or branch several weeks ago.\
0:09\
The letter announced that next Sunday,\
Easter Sunday,\
0:13\
all wards and branches are to meet\
for sacrament meeting only,\
0:17\
leaving additional time\
for worship at home\
0:20\
as families to commemorate this\
most important holiday.\
0:25\
The First Presidency’s letter caught my\
attention and it caused me to reflect\
0:29\
on the way our family has celebrated\
Easter through the years.\
0:34\
The more I thought about\
our celebrations,\
0:36\
the more I found myself wondering if\
we are inadvertently shortchanging\
0:41\
the true meaning of this holiday\
0:43\
so central to all believers\
in Jesus Christ.\
0:47\
Those thoughts led me to ponder\
the difference between\
0:50\
the way we have celebrated Christmas\
as compared with Easter.\
0:54\
During December, we somehow managed to\
incorporate the fun of “Jingle Bells,”\
0:59\
Christmas stockings, and\
gifts alongside other,\
1:02\
more thoughtful traditions—such\
as caring for those in need,\
1:08\
singing our favorite Christmas carols\
and hymns, and, of course,\
1:11\
opening the scriptures and reading\
the Christmas story in Luke 2.\
1:17\
Every year, as we read this beloved\
story from a large old Bible,\
1:21\
our family does what your\
family probably does,\
1:25\
dressed with towels on our heads\
1:27\
and donning bath robes\
to represent Joseph,\
1:30\
Mary, and the many who came to\
worship the Baby Jesus.\
1:34\
We reenact the treasured Christmas\
story of the Savior's birth.\
1:41\
Our family celebrations at Easter,\
however, have been somewhat different.\
1:46\
I feel our family has relied more\
on going to church to provide\
1:51\
the meaningful Christ-centered\
part of Easter,\
1:53\
and then as a family,\
1:56\
we’ve gathered to share in other\
Easter-related traditions.\
2:00\
I’ve loved watching our children\
and now our grandchildren hunt\
2:06\
for Easter eggs and dig through\
their Easter baskets.\
2:09\
But the First Presidency letter\
was a wake up call.\
2:13\
Not only did they invite all of us\
to make sure our celebration of\
2:17\
the most important event to\
ever happen on this earth—\
2:22\
the Atonement and Resurrection\
of Jesus Christ—\
2:25\
include the reverence and respect\
the Lord deserves;\
2:29\
they also gave us more time with our\
families and friends to do so\
2:35\
on Easter Sunday. These words\
of the Prophet Joseph Smith\
2:40\
add additional context to\
the significance of\
2:43\
the events surrounding Easter.\
2:45\
Quote: “The fundamental principles of\
our religion are the testimony of\
2:51\
the Apostles and Prophets\
concerning Jesus Christ,\
2:54\
that He died, was buried, and rose again\
the third day, and ascended into heaven;\
3:00\
and all other things which pertain to\
our religion are only appendages to it.”\
3:07\
Lisa and I have discussed ways that\
our family can do better during\
3:12\
the Easter season. Perhaps\
3:14\
the question we have asked ourselves is\
one we could all contemplate: How do\
3:20\
we model the teaching and celebration\
of the resurrection of Jesus Christ,\
3:25\
the Easter story, with the\
same balance, fullness,\
3:30\
and rich religious tradition of\
the birth of Jesus Christ,\
3:33\
the Christmas Story? It seems\
we’re all trying.\
3:38\
I observe a growing effort among\
Latter-day Saints toward\
3:41\
a more Christ-centered Easter.\
3:43\
This includes a greater and more\
thoughtful recognition of Palm Sunday\
3:48\
and Good Friday, as practiced by\
some of our Christian cousins.\
3:52\
We might also adopt appropriate Christ-\
centered Easter traditions found in\
3:57\
cultures and practices of\
countries worldwide.\
4:01\
New Testament scholar N. T. Wright\
suggested: “We should be taking steps to\
4:07\
celebrate Easter in creative new ways in\
art, literature, children's games,\
4:13\
poetry, music, dance, festivals, bells,\
special concerts. ...\
4:17\
This is our greatest festival.\
4:19\
Take Christmas away and in biblical\
terms you lose two chapters at\
4:25\
the front of Matthew and Luke,\
nothing else.\
4:28\
Take Easter away and you don’t\
have a New Testament;\
4:31\
You don’t have a Christianity.”\
4:34\
We cherish the Bible for all it teaches\
us about the birth, ministry,\
4:40\
Crucifixion, and Resurrection\
of Jesus Christ.\
4:43\
No three words embody more hope\
and eternal consequence\
4:48\
for all of humankind than those\
uttered by a heavenly angel\
4:53\
on Easter morning at the Garden Tomb:\
“He is risen.”\
4:58\
We are deeply grateful for New Testament\
scripture that preserves\
5:01\
the story of Easter and the Savior’s\
Easter ministry in Judea and Galilee.\
5:09\
As Lisa and I pondered ways to expand\
our family Easter celebration\
5:15\
to be more Christ-centered,\
5:17\
we discussed what scripture reading\
tradition we might introduce to our\
5:21\
family—the Luke 2 equivalent\
for Easter, if you will.\
5:27\
And then we had this heavenly epiphany:\
5:31\
In addition to the important verses\
about Easter in the New Testament,\
5:36\
we, as Latter-day Saints, are endowed\
with the most remarkable Easter gift—\
5:42\
a gift of unique witness,\
5:44\
another testament of the Easter\
miracle that contains perhaps\
5:49\
the most magnificent Easter scriptures\
in all of Christianity.\
5:55\
I'm referring, of course,\
5:56\
to the Book of Mormon, and\
more specifically to\
5:59\
the account of Jesus Christ appearing\
to the inhabitants in\
6:03\
the new world in His resurrected glory.\
6:06\
The Prophet Joseph Smith described\
the Book of Mormon as\
6:10\
“the most correct of any book,”\
6:13\
and beginning with 3 Nephi 11,\
6:15\
it tells the magnificent story of\
the resurrected Christ’s visit to\
6:21\
the Nephites, the Savior’s\
Easter ministry.\
6:25\
These Easter scriptures bear record\
of the resurrection of\
6:29\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
In these chapters,\
6:33\
Christ calls Twelve Apostles, teaches as\
He did in His Sermon on the Mount,\
6:39\
announces that He has fulfilled the\
law of Moses, and prophesies about\
6:44\
the latter-day\
gathering of Israel.\
6:47\
He heals the sick and prays\
for the people in such\
6:50\
a glorious way that\
“no tongue can speak,\
6:54\
neither can there be written by any man,\
6:57\
neither can the hearts of men conceive\
so great and marvelous things\
7:02\
as we both saw and heard Jesus speak;\
7:05\
and no one can conceive of the\
joy which filled our souls at\
7:09\
the time we heard him pray\
for us unto the Father.”\
7:14\
This Easter, our family\
is going to focus on\
7:17\
the first 17 verses of 3 Nephi 11.\
7:20\
You recall the great multitude\
round about the temple\
7:24\
and land Bountiful, who heard\
the voice of God\
7:27\
the Father and saw Jesus Christ\
descending out of heaven to extend\
7:33\
the most beautiful Easter invitation.\
7:37\
“Arise and come forth unto me, ... that\
ye may feel the prints of\
7:40\
the nails in my hands and in my feet,\
7:42\
that ye may know that I am the God of\
... the whole earth, and have been slain\
7:46\
for the sins of the world.\
7:49\
And ... the multitude went forth, ...\
one by one, ...\
7:51\
and did see with their eyes\
and feel with their hands, ...\
7:54\
and did bear record that it was he. ...\
7:58\
And ... they did cry out with one\
accord, saying: Hosanna!\
8:02\
Blessed be the name of\
the Most High God!\
8:04\
And they did fall down at the feet of\
Jesus, and did worship him.” Imagine,\
8:10\
the Nephites at the temple actually\
touched the hands of the Risen Lord!\
8:17\
We hope to make these chapters\
in 3 Nephi as much\
8:20\
a part of our Easter tradition as is\
Luke 2 of our Christmas tradition.\
8:27\
In reality, the Book of Mormon shares\
the greatest Easter story ever told.\
8:35\
Let it not be the greatest\
Easter story never told.\
8:40\
I invite you to look at the Book of\
Mormon in a new light and consider\
8:44\
the profound witness it bears of the\
reality of the Risen Christ,\
8:49\
as well as the richness and depth\
of the doctrine of Christ.\
8:53\
We might ask, how can reading Book of\
Mormon scriptures at Easter bless our\
8:59\
lives and those of our loved\
ones in a meaningful way?\
9:03\
More than one might realize. Any time we\
read and study from the Book of Mormon,\
9:08\
we can expect remarkable outcomes.\
9:11\
Recently, Lisa and I attended the\
viewing of a dear friend,\
9:15\
a woman of faith, whose life\
was cut short by illness.\
9:19\
We gathered with her family\
and close friends,\
9:22\
exchanging fond memories\
of this beautiful soul.\
9:25\
While standing away some distance from\
the casket conversing with others,\
9:30\
I noticed two young Primary-age girls\
approach the casket and stretch up\
9:35\
on their tiptoes, eyes just reaching its\
edge, to pay their final respects\
9:41\
to their beloved aunt. With\
no one else nearby,\
9:45\
Lisa slipped over and crouched down\
beside them to offer comfort\
9:49\
and teaching. She asked\
how they were doing\
9:52\
and if they knew where\
their aunt was now.\
9:55\
They shared their sadness, But then,\
with confidence brimming in their eyes,\
10:01\
they said they knew their aunt was now\
happy, and she could be with Jesus.\
10:08\
At this tender age, they found peace\
in the great plan of happiness\
10:13\
and, in their own childlike way,\
10:15\
testified of the profound reality\
and simple beauty of\
10:20\
the Resurrection of the Savior.\
10:22\
They knew this in their hearts\
10:24\
because of thoughtful teachings\
of loving parents,\
10:27\
family, and Primary leaders\
10:29\
planting a seed of faith in Jesus\
Christ and eternal life.\
10:34\
Wise beyond their years, many of\
10:37\
the truths these young girls understood\
come to us through the Easter message\
10:43\
and ministry of the Resurrected Savior\
and the words of prophets as told in\
10:50\
the Book of Mormon. I’ve observed that\
when President Russell M. Nelson gives\
10:55\
a gift of the Book of Mormon to\
someone not of our faith,\
10:58\
including world leaders, he often turns\
to 3 Nephi and reads about\
11:05\
the appearance of the resurrected\
Christ to the Nephites.\
11:10\
In doing so, the living\
prophet is, in essence,\
11:15\
bearing witness of the Living Christ.\
11:19\
We cannot stand as witnesses of Jesus\
Christ until we can bear witness of\
11:25\
Him. The Book of Mormon is another\
witness of Jesus Christ\
11:30\
because throughout its sacred pages,\
11:33\
one prophet after another testifies\
not only that Christ would come,\
11:38\
but that He did come. I am holding\
here in my hand a copy of\
11:44\
the first edition of the Book of Mormon.\
Doing so always moves me.\
11:50\
For much of my adult life,\
I have been fascinated,\
11:53\
enthralled, and riveted with what young\
Joseph Smith did to get this sacred\
11:58\
book of scripture translated\
and published.\
12:02\
But that is not why this book moves me.\
12:05\
It is because this book, more than any\
other ever published on this earth,\
12:10\
bears witness of the life, the ministry,\
the teachings,\
12:15\
the Atonement, and the Resurrection\
of Jesus Christ.\
12:20\
My dear brothers and sisters, studying\
regularly from this book will change\
12:24\
your life. It will open your\
eyes to new possibilities.\
12:28\
It will increase your hope and\
fill you with charity.\
12:32\
Most of all, it will build\
12:34\
and strengthen your faith in Jesus\
Christ and bless you with\
12:39\
a sure knowledge that He and our\
Father know you, love you,\
12:45\
and want you to find your way\
back home—with a capital “H.”\
12:51\
Dear brothers and sisters, the time has\
come foretold by prophets of old,\
12:58\
“when the knowledge of a Savior shall\
spread throughout every nation, kindred,\
13:04\
tongue, and people.” We are seeing\
13:06\
the fulfillment of this prophecy\
before our very eyes,\
13:09\
through the witness of Jesus Christ\
found in the Book of Mormon.\
13:14\
No book does more to show that\
because of Jesus Christ,\
13:20\
everything changed; because of Him,\
everything is better; because of Him,\
13:28\
life is manageable—especially\
in the painful moments;\
13:33\
because of Him, everything is possible.\
13:37\
His visit as a resurrected\
Savior introduced by God\
13:41\
the Father is a most glorious and\
triumphant Easter message.\
13:45\
It will help our families gain\
13:47\
a personal testimony of Jesus Christ as\
our Savior and Redeemer who broke\
13:51\
the bands of death. I close with my\
testimony of the truthfulness of\
13:56\
the Book of Mormon and of Jesus Christ\
as the Son of the living God.\
14:00\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
