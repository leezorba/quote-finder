Our son Daniel got very sick\
on his mission in Africa\
0:04\
and was taken to\
a medical facility\
0:06\
with limited resources.\
0:07\
As we read his first letter\
to us after his illness,\
0:10\
we expected that he\
would be discouraged,\
0:13\
but instead he wrote, "Even as\
I lay in the emergency room,\
0:16\
I felt peace.\
0:18\
I have never been so\
consistently and resiliently\
0:23\
happy in my life."\
0:25\
As my wife and I\
read these words,\
0:27\
we were overcome with emotion.\
0:28\
"Consistently and\
resiliently happy."\
0:32\
We had never heard happiness\
described that way,\
0:34\
but his words rang true.\
0:37\
We knew that the\
happiness he described\
0:39\
was not simply pleasure\
or an elevated mood\
0:42\
but a peace and joy that comes\
when we surrender ourselves\
0:47\
to God and put our trust\
in Him in all things.\
0:52\
We too had had those\
times in our lives\
0:55\
when God spoke\
peace to our souls\
0:58\
and caused us to\
have hope in Christ\
1:00\
even when life was\
hard and uncertain.\
1:04\
Lehi teaches that if Adam\
and Eve had not fallen,\
1:07\
"they would have remained\
in a state of innocence,\
1:09\
having no joy, for\
they knew no misery.\
1:13\
...\
1:13\
"But behold, all things have\
been done in the wisdom of him\
1:18\
who knoweth all things.\
1:21\
"Adam fell that men\
might be; and men\
1:24\
are, that they might have joy."\
1:28\
In a paradoxical way,\
afflictions and sorrow\
1:31\
prepare us to\
experience joy if we\
1:34\
will trust in the Lord\
and His plan for us.\
1:37\
This truth is\
beautifully expressed\
1:40\
by a 13th-century poet:\
"Sorrow prepares you for joy.\
1:44\
It violently sweeps\
everything out of your house,\
1:47\
so that new joy can\
find space to enter.\
1:50\
It shakes the yellow leaves\
from the bough of your heart,\
1:54\
so that fresh, green leaves\
can grow in their place.\
1:57\
It pulls up the rotten roots,\
so that new roots hidden beneath\
2:01\
have room to grow.\
2:03\
Whatever sorrow shakes\
from your heart,\
2:05\
far better things will\
take their place."\
2:09\
President Russell M.\
Nelson taught the joy\
2:12\
the Savior offers\
us "is constant,\
2:15\
assuring us that\
our 'afflictions\
2:17\
shall be but a small moment'\
and be consecrated to our gain."\
2:23\
Our trials and afflictions can\
make space for greater joy.\
2:28\
The good news of the gospel is\
not the promise of a life free\
2:30\
of sorrow and tribulation\
but a life full of purpose\
2:34\
and meaning--a life where our\
sorrows and afflictions can be\
2:37\
"swallowed up in\
the joy of Christ."\
2:40\
The Savior declared,\
"In the world\
2:43\
ye shall have tribulation:\
but be of good cheer;\
2:46\
I have overcome the world."\
2:49\
His gospel is a message of hope.\
2:52\
Sorrow coupled with\
hope in Jesus Christ\
2:55\
holds the promise\
of enduring joy.\
2:59\
The account of the Jaredites'\
journey to the promised land\
3:02\
can be used as a metaphor for\
our journey through mortality.\
3:06\
The Lord promised the brother\
of Jared and his people\
3:09\
that he would "go before\
[them] into a land which\
3:13\
is choice above all the\
lands of the earth."\
3:15\
He commanded them\
to build barges,\
3:18\
and they obediently went to\
work building them according\
3:21\
to the Lord's instructions.\
3:22\
However, as the work\
progressed, the brother of Jared\
3:26\
developed concerns that the\
Lord's design for the barges\
3:30\
was not sufficient.\
3:31\
He cried out:\
3:33\
"O Lord, I have performed the\
work which thou hast commanded\
3:37\
me, and I have made the\
barges according as thou hast\
3:40\
directed me.\
3:41\
"And behold, O Lord, in\
them there is no light."\
3:44\
"O Lord, wilt thou suffer that\
we shall cross this great water\
3:48\
in darkness?"\
3:50\
Have you ever poured out your\
soul to God in such a way?\
3:53\
When striving to live as the\
Lord commands and righteous\
3:56\
expectations are not\
met, have you ever\
3:59\
wondered if you must go\
through this life in darkness?\
4:03\
The brother of Jared then\
expressed an even greater\
4:06\
concern about their ability\
to survive in the barges.\
4:09\
He cried, "And also\
we shall perish,\
4:13\
for in them we cannot breathe,\
save it is the air which is\
4:17\
in them."\
4:17\
Have the difficulties of life\
ever made it hard for you\
4:21\
to breathe and\
caused you to wonder\
4:23\
how you can make\
it through the day,\
4:25\
let alone make it back\
to your heavenly home?\
4:29\
After the Lord worked with the\
brother of Jared to resolve\
4:32\
each of his concerns,\
He then explained,\
4:34\
"Ye cannot cross this great deep\
save I prepare [a way for] you\
4:41\
against the waves of the sea,\
and the winds which have gone\
4:44\
forth, and the floods\
which shall come."\
4:48\
The Lord made it clear that\
ultimately the Jaredites could\
4:52\
not make it to the\
promised land without Him.\
4:55\
They were not in\
control, and the only way\
4:58\
they could make it\
across the great deep\
5:00\
was to put their trust in Him.\
5:03\
These experiences and\
tutoring from the Lord\
5:06\
seemed to deepen the\
brother of Jared's faith\
5:09\
and strengthen his\
trust in the Lord.\
5:12\
Notice how his prayers changed\
from questions and concerns\
5:16\
to expressions of\
faith and trust:\
5:20\
"I know, O Lord, that\
thou hast all power,\
5:22\
and can do whatsoever thou wilt\
for the benefit of man. ...\
5:26\
"Behold, O Lord,\
thou canst do this.\
5:29\
We know that thou art\
able to show forth\
5:31\
great power, which looks small\
unto the understanding of men."\
5:38\
It is recorded that the\
Jaredites then "got aboard\
5:40\
of their ... barges, and\
set forth into the sea,\
5:44\
commending themselves\
unto the Lord their God."\
5:48\
To commend means to\
entrust or to surrender.\
5:52\
The Jaredites did not\
get into the barges\
5:54\
because they knew\
exactly how things\
5:56\
would work on their journey.\
5:58\
They got aboard because\
they had learned\
6:01\
to trust in the Lord's\
power, goodness, and mercy,\
6:05\
and they were therefore\
willing to surrender themselves\
6:08\
and any doubts or fears they\
may have had to the Lord.\
6:13\
Recently our grandson\
Abe was afraid to ride\
6:16\
one of the carousel animals\
that move up and down.\
6:19\
He preferred one\
that didn't move.\
6:21\
His grandmother\
finally persuaded him\
6:23\
that it would be safe, so,\
trusting her, he got aboard.\
6:26\
He then said with a big smile,\
"I don't feel safe, but I am."\
6:32\
Perhaps that is how\
the Jaredites felt.\
6:36\
Trusting God may not always feel\
safe at first, but joy follows.\
6:42\
The journey was not\
easy for the Jaredites.\
6:45\
"They were many times buried\
in the depths of the sea,\
6:48\
because of the mountain\
waves which broke upon them."\
6:51\
Yet it is recorded that\
"the wind did never\
6:55\
cease to blow [them]\
towards the promised land."\
6:59\
As difficult as it is to\
understand, especially\
7:02\
at the times in our lives\
when the headwinds are strong\
7:05\
and the seas are turbulent,\
we can take comfort\
7:08\
in knowing that God in\
His infinite goodness\
7:11\
is always blowing\
us towards home.\
7:15\
The record continues,\
"They were driven forth;\
7:18\
and no monster of the sea could\
break them, neither whale that\
7:21\
could mar them; and they\
did have light continually,\
7:24\
whether it was above the\
water or under the water."\
7:28\
We live in a world\
where the monster waves\
7:30\
of death, physical\
and mental illness,\
7:33\
and trials and afflictions\
of every kind break upon us.\
7:37\
Yet, through faith\
in Jesus Christ\
7:39\
and choosing to\
trust in Him, we too\
7:42\
can have light continually,\
whether above the water\
7:46\
or under the water.\
7:48\
We can have the\
assurance that God never\
7:51\
does cease to blow us\
towards our heavenly home.\
7:56\
While being tossed\
about in the barges,\
7:58\
the Jaredites "did sing\
praises unto the Lord; ...\
8:01\
and [they] did thank and praise\
the Lord all the day long;\
8:04\
and when the night came,\
they did not cease to praise\
8:07\
the Lord."\
8:08\
They felt joy and\
thanksgiving even\
8:11\
in the midst of\
their afflictions.\
8:13\
They had not yet arrived\
in the promised land,\
8:16\
yet they were rejoicing in\
the promised blessing because\
8:20\
of their consistent and\
resilient trust in Him.\
8:27\
The Jaredites were driven\
forth upon the water 344 days.\
8:29\
Can you imagine that?\
8:32\
Trusting in the Lord includes\
trusting in His timing\
8:36\
and requires patience\
and endurance that\
8:39\
outlasts the storms of life.\
8:43\
Ultimately, the\
Jaredites "did land\
8:45\
upon the shore of\
the promised land.\
8:47\
And when they had set their feet\
upon the shores of the promised\
8:50\
land they bowed themselves\
down upon the face of the land,\
8:54\
and did humble themselves\
before the Lord,\
8:57\
and did shed tears of\
joy before the Lord,\
9:01\
because of the multitude of\
his tender mercies over them."\
9:06\
If we are faithful in\
keeping our covenants,\
9:09\
we too will one day\
arrive safely home\
9:13\
and will bow before the\
Lord and shed tears of joy\
9:17\
for the multitude of His\
tender mercies in our lives,\
9:20\
including the sorrows that\
made space for more joy.\
9:27\
I testify that as\
we commend ourselves\
9:29\
unto the Lord and\
consistently and resiliently\
9:33\
trust in Jesus Christ and His\
divine purposes in our lives,\
9:37\
that He will visit\
us with assurances,\
9:39\
speak peace to our souls,\
and cause us to "hope\
9:43\
for our deliverance in him."\
9:46\
I witness that\
Jesus is the Christ.\
9:49\
He is the source of all joy.\
9:52\
His grace is sufficient,\
and He is mighty to save.\
9:57\
He is the light, the life,\
and the hope of the world.\
10:02\
He will not let us perish.\
10:04\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
