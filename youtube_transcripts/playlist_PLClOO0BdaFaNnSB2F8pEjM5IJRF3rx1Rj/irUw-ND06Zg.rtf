I earnestly pray\
for the assistance\
0:03\
of the Holy Ghost\
for you and for me\
0:06\
as we rejoice and worship\
together in this session\
0:09\
of general conference.\
0:12\
In April of 1976,\
Elder Boyd K. Packer\
0:16\
spoke specifically to\
the youth of the Church\
0:18\
in general conference.\
0:20\
In his classic message entitled\
"Spiritual Crocodiles,"\
0:25\
he described how during\
an assignment in Africa\
0:28\
he observed well-camouflaged\
crocodiles preying\
0:31\
on unsuspecting victims.\
0:34\
He then likened the\
crocodiles to Satan,\
0:37\
who preys on unwary\
youth by camouflaging\
0:40\
the deadly nature of sin.\
0:44\
I was 23 years old when\
Elder Packer gave that talk,\
0:47\
and Susan and I\
were anticipating\
0:50\
the birth of our first\
child in just a few days.\
0:53\
We were impressed with\
the content of his message\
0:56\
about avoiding sin\
and the masterful way\
1:00\
he used the ordinary\
behavior of animals\
1:03\
to teach an important lesson.\
1:07\
Susan and I also have traveled\
to Africa on many assignments.\
1:11\
And we have had opportunities\
to see the magnificent animals\
1:15\
that live on that continent.\
1:17\
Remembering the impact of Elder\
Packer's talk in our lives,\
1:21\
we have tried to observe\
and learn lessons\
1:24\
from the behavior\
of African wildlife.\
1:28\
I want to describe the\
characteristics and tactics\
1:31\
of two cheetahs Susan and I\
watched hunting their prey\
1:36\
and relate some of the things\
we observed to the daily living\
1:40\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
1:44\
Cheetahs are the fastest land\
animals on earth and reach\
1:49\
running speeds as high\
as 75 miles an hour.\
1:53\
These beautiful\
animals can accelerate\
1:55\
from a standstill position\
to running as fast as 68\
2:00\
mph in less than three seconds.\
2:03\
Cheetahs are predators\
that sneak up\
2:07\
on their prey and sprint a short\
distance to chase and attack.\
2:13\
Susan and I spent\
almost two hours\
2:15\
watching two cheetahs stalking\
a large group of topis,\
2:20\
Africa's most common and\
widespread antelopes.\
2:24\
The tall, dry grass\
of the African savanna\
2:27\
was golden brown and almost\
totally obscured the predators\
2:31\
as they pursued\
a group of topis.\
2:34\
The cheetahs were\
separated from each other\
2:37\
by approximately 100 yards\
but worked in tandem.\
2:42\
While one cheetah sat upright\
in the grass and did not move,\
2:47\
the other cheetah\
crouched low to the ground\
2:50\
and slowly crept closer\
to the unsuspecting topis.\
2:54\
Then the cheetah that\
had been sitting upright\
2:57\
disappeared in the grass\
at exactly the same moment\
3:01\
that the other\
cheetah sat upright.\
3:04\
This alternating pattern of\
one cheetah crouching low\
3:08\
and creeping forward while\
the other cheetah sat upright\
3:12\
in the grass continued\
for a long time.\
3:15\
The stealthy subtlety\
of the strategy\
3:19\
was intended to distract\
and deceive the topis\
3:23\
and thereby divert\
their attention away\
3:25\
from the approaching danger.\
3:28\
Patiently and steadily, the\
two cheetahs worked as a team\
3:34\
to secure their next meal.\
3:37\
Positioned between\
the large group\
3:39\
of topis and the\
approaching cheetahs\
3:42\
were several older and\
stronger topis standing\
3:45\
as sentinels on termite mounds.\
3:48\
The enhanced view of the\
grasslands from the small hills\
3:52\
enabled these guardian topis\
to watch for signs of danger.\
3:57\
Then suddenly, as\
the cheetahs appeared\
4:00\
to be within striking distance,\
the entire group of topis\
4:04\
turned and ran away.\
4:06\
I do not know if or how the\
sentinel topis communicated\
4:11\
with the larger group, but\
somehow a warning was given,\
4:16\
and all the topis moved\
to a place of safety.\
4:20\
And what did the\
cheetahs do next?\
4:23\
Without any delay,\
the two cheetahs\
4:26\
resumed their\
alternating pattern\
4:28\
of one cheetah crouching\
low and creeping forward\
4:32\
while the other cheetah\
sat upright in the grass.\
4:36\
The pattern of\
pursuit continued.\
4:39\
They did not stop.\
4:41\
They did not rest\
or take a break.\
4:44\
They were relentless in\
following their strategy\
4:47\
of distraction and diversion.\
4:51\
Susan and I watched the cheetahs\
disappear in the distance,\
4:55\
always moving closer and\
closer to the group of topis.\
5:01\
That night Susan and I had\
a memorable conversation\
5:03\
about what we had\
observed and learned.\
5:06\
We also discussed\
this experience\
5:09\
with our children\
and grandchildren\
5:11\
and identified many\
valuable lessons.\
5:14\
I now will describe just\
three of those lessons.\
5:19\
LESSON NUMBER ONE: Beware of\
evil's beguiling disguises.\
5:24\
To me, cheetahs are\
sleek, alluring,\
5:28\
and captivating creatures.\
5:30\
A cheetah's yellowish-tan\
to greyish-white coat\
5:34\
with black spots acts\
as a beautiful disguise\
5:39\
that makes these animals\
almost invisible as they\
5:42\
stalk their prey in\
the African grasslands.\
5:47\
In a similar way, spiritually\
dangerous ideas and actions\
5:52\
frequently can appear to\
be attractive, desirable,\
5:56\
or pleasurable.\
5:57\
Thus, in our contemporary\
world, each of us\
6:01\
needs to be aware of beguiling\
bad that pretends to be good.\
6:07\
As Isaiah warned,\
"Woe unto them that\
6:10\
call evil good, and good evil;\
that put darkness for light,\
6:16\
and light for darkness;\
that put bitter for sweet,\
6:20\
and sweet for bitter!"\
6:23\
In a paradoxical\
period when violating\
6:26\
the sanctity of human\
life is heralded\
6:29\
as a right and chaos is\
described as liberty, how\
6:34\
blessed we are to live in\
this latter-day dispensation\
6:38\
when restored gospel light can\
shine brightly in our lives\
6:42\
and help us to discern the\
adversary's dark deceptions\
6:47\
and distractions.\
6:50\
"For they that are wise and\
have received the truth,\
6:53\
and have taken the Holy\
Spirit for their guide,\
6:57\
and have not been\
deceived--verily I say unto\
7:01\
you, they shall not be hewn\
down and cast into the fire,\
7:05\
but shall abide the day."\
7:09\
LESSON NUMBER TWO: Stay\
awake and be alert.\
7:13\
For a topi, a brief moment of\
carelessness or inattentiveness\
7:19\
could invite a swift\
attack from a cheetah.\
7:22\
Likewise, spiritual\
complacency and casualness\
7:27\
make us vulnerable to the\
advances of the adversary.\
7:31\
Spiritual thoughtlessness\
invites great danger\
7:35\
into our lives.\
7:38\
Nephi described how in the\
latter days Satan would attempt\
7:41\
to pacify and lull the children\
of God into a false sense\
7:46\
of "carnal security, that they\
will say: All is well in Zion;\
7:51\
yea, Zion prospereth, all\
is well--and thus the devil\
7:57\
cheateth their souls, and\
leadeth them away carefully\
8:01\
down to hell."\
8:03\
Constant vigilance is\
required to counteract\
8:07\
complacency and casualness.\
8:10\
To be vigilant is\
the state or action\
8:13\
of keeping careful watch\
for possible danger\
8:17\
or difficulties.\
8:19\
And keeping watch denotes\
the act of staying awake\
8:22\
to guard and protect.\
8:25\
Spiritually speaking, we\
need to stay awake and be\
8:29\
alert to the promptings\
of the Holy Ghost\
8:31\
and to the signals that\
come from the Lord's\
8:34\
watchmen on the towers.\
8:38\
"Yea, and I also exhort you ...\
that ye be watchful unto prayer\
8:41\
continually, that ye may not\
be led away by the temptations\
8:45\
of the devil, ... for behold,\
he rewardeth you no good thing."\
8:52\
Focusing our lives\
in and on the Savior\
8:55\
and His gospel\
enables us to overcome\
8:59\
the tendency of the\
natural man to be\
9:01\
spiritually snoozy and lazy.\
9:04\
As we are blessed with eyes\
to see and ears to hear,\
9:09\
the Holy Ghost can\
increase our capacity\
9:12\
to look and listen when\
we may not typically\
9:15\
think we need to look or\
listen or when we may not think\
9:21\
anything can be seen or heard.\
9:25\
"Watch, therefore,\
that ye may be ready."\
9:30\
LESSON NUMBER THREE: Understand\
the intent of the enemy.\
9:33\
A cheetah is a\
predator that naturally\
9:38\
preys on other animals.\
9:40\
All day, every day, a\
cheetah is a predator.\
9:47\
Satan "is the enemy of\
righteousness and of those who\
9:50\
seek to do the will of God."\
9:52\
All day, every day, his\
only intent and sole purpose\
9:58\
are to make the sons\
and daughters of God\
10:00\
miserable like unto himself.\
10:04\
The Father's plan\
of happiness is\
10:06\
designed to provide\
direction for His children,\
10:09\
to help them experience\
enduring joy,\
10:12\
and to bring them\
safely home to Him\
10:14\
with resurrected,\
exalted bodies.\
10:17\
The devil labors to make the\
sons and daughters of God\
10:21\
confused and unhappy\
and to hinder\
10:25\
their eternal progression.\
10:27\
The adversary works\
relentlessly to attack\
10:30\
the elements of the Father's\
plan he hates the most.\
10:36\
Satan does not have a body,\
and his eternal progress\
10:41\
has been halted.\
10:42\
Just as water flowing in a\
riverbed is stopped by a dam,\
10:47\
so the adversary's\
eternal progress\
10:50\
is thwarted because he does\
not have a physical body.\
10:54\
Because of his\
rebellion, Lucifer\
10:57\
has denied himself all\
of the mortal blessings\
11:00\
and experiences made possible\
through a tabernacle of flesh\
11:04\
and bones.\
11:06\
One of the potent scriptural\
meanings of the word damned\
11:11\
is illustrated in his\
inability to continue\
11:14\
progressing and becoming\
like our Heavenly Father.\
11:19\
Because a physical body is so\
central to the Father's plan\
11:22\
of happiness and our\
spiritual development,\
11:25\
Lucifer seeks to\
frustrate our progression\
11:29\
by tempting us to use\
our bodies improperly.\
11:33\
President Russell M. Nelson has\
taught that spiritual safety\
11:38\
ultimately lies in "'never\
taking the first enticing step\
11:44\
toward going where you should\
not go and doing what you\
11:48\
should not do.' ...\
11:50\
As human beings we all\
have [physical] appetites\
11:53\
necessary for our survival.\
11:56\
'These appetites are absolutely\
essential for the perpetuation\
12:00\
of life.\
12:02\
So, what does the\
adversary do? ...\
12:04\
He attacks us through\
our appetites.\
12:07\
He tempts us to eat\
things we should not eat,\
12:11\
to drink things we\
should not drink,\
12:13\
and to love as we\
should not love!'"\
12:19\
One of the ultimate\
ironies of eternity\
12:23\
is that the adversary,\
who is miserable precisely\
12:27\
because he has no physical\
body, invites and entices\
12:32\
us to share in his misery\
through the improper use\
12:36\
of our bodies.\
12:38\
The very tool he does not\
have and cannot use is thus\
12:43\
the primary target of his\
attempts to lure us to physical\
12:47\
and spiritual destruction.\
12:51\
Understanding the\
intent of an enemy\
12:53\
is vital to\
effective preparation\
12:56\
for possible attacks.\
12:58\
Precisely because Captain\
Moroni knew the intention\
13:01\
of the Lamanites,\
he was prepared\
13:04\
to meet them at the\
time of their coming\
13:07\
and was victorious.\
13:09\
And that same principle and\
promise applies to each of us.\
13:14\
"If ye are prepared,\
ye shall not fear.\
13:19\
"And that ye might escape\
the power of the enemy."\
13:25\
Just as important\
lessons can be learned\
13:27\
by observing the behavior\
of cheetahs and topis,\
13:30\
so each of us should look for\
the lessons and warnings found\
13:34\
in the simple events\
of everyday life.\
13:37\
As we seek for a mind\
and heart open to receive\
13:41\
heavenly direction by the\
power of the Holy Ghost,\
13:44\
then some of\
greatest instructions\
13:47\
that we can receive and many\
of the most powerful warnings\
13:51\
that can safeguard\
us will originate\
13:54\
in our own ordinary experiences.\
13:57\
Powerful parables are contained\
in both the scriptures\
14:02\
and in our daily lives.\
14:05\
I have highlighted only three\
of the many lessons that\
14:08\
can be identified in\
this adventure Susan\
14:10\
and I had in Africa.\
14:12\
I invite and encourage\
you to reflect\
14:15\
on this episode with the\
cheetahs and the topis\
14:18\
and identify additional lessons\
for you and your family.\
14:24\
Please remember always that\
your home is the true center\
14:29\
of gospel learning and living.\
14:32\
As you respond in faith to\
this invitation, inspired\
14:36\
thoughts will come to your mind,\
spiritual feelings will swell\
14:41\
in your heart, and you will\
recognize actions that should\
14:45\
be undertaken or continued\
so that you can "take\
14:49\
upon you [the] whole\
armor [of God],\
14:52\
that ye may be able to withstand\
the evil day, having done all,\
14:56\
that ye may be able to stand."\
14:59\
I promise that the blessings\
of effective preparation\
15:04\
and spiritual protection\
will flow into your life\
15:08\
as you are watchful unto prayer\
vigilantly and continually.\
15:15\
I testify that pressing\
forward on the covenant path\
15:18\
provides spiritual safety\
and invites enduring joy\
15:23\
into our lives.\
15:24\
And I witness that\
the risen and living\
15:27\
Savior will sustain\
and strengthen us\
15:31\
in times both good and bad.\
15:33\
Of these truths I testify\
in the sacred name\
15:38\
of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen\
