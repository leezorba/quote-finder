Not long ago, I\
woke up and prepared\
0:04\
to study the scriptures.\
0:06\
I picked up my smartphone and\
sat in a chair next to my bed,\
0:10\
with the intention of opening\
the Gospel Library app.\
0:13\
I unlocked my phone and\
was just about to begin\
0:17\
studying when I saw a half dozen\
notifications for text messages\
0:22\
and emails that had\
come during the night.\
0:24\
I thought, "I'll quickly\
check those messages,\
0:28\
and then I'll get right\
to the scriptures."\
0:30\
Well, two hours\
later, I was sitting\
0:35\
reading text messages, emails,\
news briefs, and social media\
0:39\
posts.\
0:40\
When I realized\
what time it was,\
0:42\
I frantically rushed to\
get ready for the day.\
0:45\
That morning I missed\
my scripture study,\
0:49\
and consequently I didn't\
get the spiritual nourishment\
0:52\
I was hoping for.\
0:54\
I'm sure many of you can relate.\
0:56\
Modern technologies\
bless us in many ways.\
1:01\
They can connect us\
with friends and family,\
1:04\
with information, and with\
news about current events\
1:07\
around the world.\
1:08\
However, they can\
also distract us\
1:11\
from the most\
important connection:\
1:14\
our connection with heaven.\
1:17\
I repeat what our prophet,\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
1:20\
has said: "We live in\
a world that is complex\
1:24\
and increasingly contentious.\
1:26\
The constant availability of\
social media and a 24-hour news\
1:30\
cycle bombard us with\
relentless messages.\
1:34\
If we are to have any\
hope of sifting through\
1:37\
the myriad of voices and\
the philosophies of men\
1:40\
that attack truth, we must\
learn to receive revelation."\
1:46\
President Nelson went on to\
warn that "in coming days,\
1:48\
it will not be possible\
to survive spiritually\
1:52\
without the guiding,\
directing, comforting,\
1:55\
and constant influence\
of the Holy Ghost."\
1:58\
Years ago, President Boyd K.\
Packer told of a herd of deer\
2:02\
that, because of\
heavy snowfall, was\
2:04\
trapped outside\
its natural habitat\
2:06\
and faced possible starvation.\
2:09\
Some well-meaning people, in\
an effort to save the deer,\
2:13\
dumped truckloads of\
hay around the area.\
2:16\
It wasn't what deer\
would normally eat,\
2:18\
but they hoped it\
would at least get\
2:20\
the deer through the winter.\
2:22\
Sadly, most of the deer\
were later found dead.\
2:26\
They had eaten the hay, but\
it did not nourish them,\
2:30\
and they starved to death\
with their stomachs full.\
2:34\
Many of the messages that\
bombard us in the information\
2:37\
age are the spiritual equivalent\
of feeding hay to deer--we can\
2:42\
eat it all day long, but\
it will not nourish us.\
2:46\
Where do we find true\
spiritual nourishment?\
2:50\
Most often, it is not\
trending on social media.\
2:54\
We find it when we "press [our]\
way forward" on the covenant\
2:57\
path, "continually holding\
fast to the rod of iron,"\
3:02\
and partake of the fruit\
of the tree of life.\
3:05\
This means that we must\
deliberately take time each day\
3:09\
to disconnect from the world\
and connect with heaven.\
3:13\
In his dream, Lehi saw people\
who partook of the fruit\
3:18\
but then abandoned it\
because of the influence\
3:21\
of the great and\
spacious building,\
3:23\
the pride of the world.\
3:25\
It is possible for young people\
to be raised in a Latter-day\
3:29\
Saint home, attend all the right\
Church meetings and classes,\
3:33\
even participate in\
ordinances in the temple,\
3:36\
and then walk away\
"into forbidden paths\
3:40\
and [become] lost."\
3:41\
Why does this happen?\
3:43\
In many cases it is\
because, while they\
3:46\
may have been going through\
the motions of spirituality,\
3:50\
they were not truly converted.\
3:52\
They were fed but not nourished.\
3:56\
In contrast, I have\
met many of you\
3:59\
young Latter-day Saints who are\
strong, bright, and faithful.\
4:04\
You know that you are\
sons and daughters of God\
4:07\
and that He has a\
work for you to do.\
4:10\
You love God with all\
your "heart, might, mind\
4:13\
and strength."\
4:14\
You keep your covenants\
and serve others,\
4:17\
beginning at home.\
4:18\
You exercise faith, repent,\
and improve each day,\
4:22\
and this brings\
you enduring joy.\
4:25\
You are preparing\
for temple blessings\
4:27\
and other opportunities you\
will have as true followers\
4:31\
of the Savior.\
4:32\
And you are helping prepare the\
world for the Second Coming,\
4:36\
inviting all to come\
unto Christ and receive\
4:39\
the blessings of His Atonement.\
4:41\
You are connected with heaven.\
4:44\
Yes, you face challenges.\
4:46\
But so does every generation.\
4:49\
These are our days, and we need\
to be faithful, not faithless.\
4:55\
I testify that the Lord\
knows about our challenges,\
4:59\
and through the leadership\
of President Nelson,\
5:02\
He is preparing us to meet them.\
5:04\
I believe that the prophet's\
recent call for a home-centered\
5:08\
church, supported by what\
we do in our buildings,\
5:11\
is designed to help us\
survive--even thrive--in this\
5:15\
day of spiritual malnutrition.\
5:19\
What does it mean to be\
a home-centered church?\
5:21\
Homes can look very\
different across the world.\
5:24\
You may belong to a family\
who has been in the Church\
5:27\
for many generations.\
5:29\
Or you may be the only member\
of the Church in your family.\
5:33\
You may be married or single,\
with or without children\
5:36\
at home.\
5:38\
Regardless of your\
circumstances,\
5:40\
you can make your\
home the center\
5:43\
of gospel learning and living.\
5:45\
It simply means taking\
personal responsibility\
5:49\
for your conversion\
and spiritual growth.\
5:51\
It means following\
President Nelson's counsel\
5:54\
"to [remodel your] home\
into a sanctuary of faith."\
6:00\
The adversary will\
try to persuade you\
6:02\
that spiritual nourishment isn't\
necessary or, more cunningly,\
6:06\
that it can wait.\
6:08\
He is the master of distraction\
and author of procrastination.\
6:13\
He will bring things\
to your attention\
6:16\
that seem urgent but in\
reality aren't that important.\
6:19\
He would have you\
become so "troubled\
6:22\
about many things" that\
you neglect the "one\
6:24\
thing [that] is needful."\
6:27\
How grateful I am for\
my "goodly parents,"\
6:30\
who raised their\
family in a home\
6:32\
of constant spiritual\
nourishment,\
6:34\
loving relationships, and\
wholesome recreational\
6:37\
activities.\
6:38\
The teachings they\
provided in my youth\
6:40\
have held me in good stead.\
6:42\
Parents, please build\
strong relationships\
6:45\
with your children.\
6:46\
They need more of\
your time, not less.\
6:50\
As you do, the Church\
is there to support you.\
6:53\
Our experiences at\
church can reinforce\
6:56\
the spiritual nourishment\
that happens at home.\
6:59\
So far, we have seen this\
kind of Church support\
7:02\
in Sunday School and Primary.\
7:04\
And we will see more of it in\
Aaronic Priesthood and Young\
7:07\
Women meetings too.\
7:09\
Starting this January, the\
curriculum for these meetings\
7:12\
will be adjusted slightly.\
7:14\
It will still focus\
on gospel topics,\
7:17\
but those topics will\
be aligned with Come,\
7:19\
Follow Me--For\
Individuals and Families.\
7:22\
This is a small change, but\
it can make a big impact\
7:26\
on the spiritual\
nourishment of the youth.\
7:30\
What other kinds of support\
does the Church provide?\
7:33\
At church we partake\
of the sacrament,\
7:35\
which helps us\
reestablish our commitment\
7:38\
to the Savior each week.\
7:40\
And at church we gather\
with other believers who\
7:43\
have made that same commitment.\
7:46\
The loving\
relationships we develop\
7:48\
with fellow disciples\
of Jesus Christ\
7:51\
can be a powerful support to\
our home-centered discipleship.\
7:57\
When I was 14, my family\
moved to a new neighborhood.\
8:00\
Now this may not seem\
like a terrible tragedy\
8:03\
to you, but in my mind, at\
that time, it was devastating.\
8:07\
It meant being surrounded\
by people I didn't know.\
8:09\
It meant that all the\
other young men in my ward\
8:12\
would be attending a\
different school than I was.\
8:14\
And in my 14-year-old mind, I\
thought, "How could my parents\
8:17\
do this to me?"\
8:19\
I felt as if my life\
had been ruined.\
8:22\
However, through our\
Young Men activities,\
8:25\
I was able to\
build relationships\
8:27\
with the other\
members of my quorum,\
8:29\
and they became my friends.\
8:31\
In addition, members of\
the bishopric and Aaronic\
8:34\
Priesthood advisers began\
to take a special interest\
8:38\
in my life.\
8:39\
They attended my\
athletic events.\
8:41\
They wrote me encouraging notes\
that I have kept to this day.\
8:45\
They continued to keep in touch\
with me after I went to college\
8:49\
and when I left for a mission.\
8:51\
One of them was even at the\
airport when I came home.\
8:54\
I will be forever grateful\
for these good brothers\
8:58\
and their combination of high\
love and high expectations.\
9:03\
They pointed me heavenward,\
and life became bright, happy,\
9:07\
and joyful.\
9:09\
How do we, as\
parents and leaders,\
9:11\
help the youth know\
they are not alone\
9:14\
as they walk the covenant path?\
9:16\
In addition to building\
personal relationships,\
9:19\
we invite them to gatherings\
large and small--from FSY\
9:24\
conferences and youth camps\
to weekly quorum and class\
9:27\
activities.\
9:29\
Never underestimate\
the strength that\
9:31\
comes from gathering\
with others who\
9:34\
are also trying to be strong.\
9:36\
Bishops and other\
leaders, please focus\
9:39\
on nourishing the children\
and youth in your ward.\
9:42\
They need more of\
your time, not less.\
9:46\
Whether you are a leader, a\
neighbor, a quorum member,\
9:49\
or simply a fellow Saint,\
if you have the opportunity\
9:52\
to touch the life of a\
young person, help him\
9:55\
or her connect with heaven.\
9:58\
Your influence might be\
exactly the "Church support"\
10:01\
that young person needs.\
10:04\
Brothers and sisters, I\
testify that Jesus Christ\
10:08\
is at the head of this Church.\
10:10\
He is inspiring our\
leaders, guiding us\
10:13\
to the spiritual nourishment\
we need to survive and thrive\
10:17\
in the latter days.\
10:19\
That spiritual\
nourishment will help us\
10:22\
be faithful and not faithless.\
10:24\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
