I am grateful for the\
blessing of addressing you,\
0:06\
the covenant daughters of God.\
0:09\
Tonight my purpose\
is to encourage you\
0:14\
in the great service to\
which you are called.\
0:19\
Yes, every daughter of\
God listening to my voice\
0:25\
has received a call from\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
0:30\
Your call began when you\
were placed into mortality,\
0:34\
in a place and\
time chosen for you\
0:38\
by a God who knows you perfectly\
and loves you as His daughter.\
0:45\
In the spirit world, He knew you\
and taught you and placed you\
0:52\
where you would have\
the opportunity,\
0:54\
rare in the history\
of the world,\
0:57\
to be invited into\
a baptismal font.\
1:01\
There, you would\
hear these words\
1:05\
spoken by a called\
servant of Jesus Christ:\
1:11\
"Having been commissioned\
of Jesus Christ,\
1:15\
I baptize you in the name of\
the Father, and of the Son,\
1:20\
and of the Holy Ghost.\
1:22\
Amen."\
1:25\
When you came up\
out of the water,\
1:28\
you had accepted\
another call to serve.\
1:32\
As a new covenant daughter\
of God, you made a promise\
1:37\
and received an\
assignment in The Church\
1:41\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints, of which you\
1:44\
were confirmed a member.\
1:47\
You covenanted with God\
to take upon yourself\
1:51\
the name of Jesus Christ,\
to keep His commandments,\
1:56\
and to serve Him.\
2:00\
For each one who\
makes these covenants,\
2:02\
the service that the Lord\
calls him or her to do\
2:06\
will be suited perfectly\
to that person.\
2:10\
The covenant daughters\
and sons of God,\
2:13\
however, all share one\
important and joyful call.\
2:20\
It is to serve others for Him.\
2:25\
Speaking to sisters,\
President Russell M. Nelson\
2:29\
gave a wonderful summary\
of the Lord's call\
2:32\
to you to join Him in His work.\
2:36\
President Nelson described\
your call in this way:\
2:42\
"The Lord said, 'My work and\
my glory [is] to bring to pass\
2:47\
the immortality and\
eternal life of man.'\
2:51\
So His devoted\
daughter-disciple may truly say,\
2:57\
'My work and my glory is to\
help my loved ones reach that\
3:04\
heavenly goal.'"\
3:07\
HE WENT ON: "To help\
another human being reach\
3:10\
one's [essential]\
potential is part\
3:13\
of the divine mission of woman.\
3:17\
As mother, teacher,\
or nurturing Saint,\
3:23\
she molds living clay to\
the shape of her hopes.\
3:30\
In partnership with\
God, her divine mission\
3:34\
is to help spirits live\
and souls be lifted.\
3:39\
This is the measure\
of her creation.\
3:43\
It is ennobling,\
edifying, and exalting."\
3:50\
You cannot know when, or\
for what length of time,\
3:54\
your personal mission will be\
focused on service in calls\
3:59\
such as mother, leader,\
or ministering sister.\
4:05\
The Lord, out of love,\
does not leave us\
4:09\
the choice of the\
timing, duration,\
4:13\
or sequence of our assignments.\
4:17\
Yet you know from scripture\
and living prophets\
4:21\
that all of these assignments\
will come, either in this life\
4:26\
or in the next, to\
every daughter of God.\
4:32\
And all of them are preparation\
for eternal life in loving\
4:37\
families--the greatest\
of all the gifts of God.\
4:43\
You will be wise to bend\
every effort to prepare now\
4:48\
with the end in mind.\
4:51\
That task is made\
simpler because each\
4:55\
of these assignments require\
much of the same preparation.\
5:00\
Let's start with the assignment\
to be a ministering sister.\
5:06\
Whether you have that assignment\
as a 10-year-old daughter\
5:09\
in a family where\
the father has died,\
5:12\
or as a Relief Society president\
whose town has recently been\
5:18\
affected by fire, or when you\
are in a hospital recovering\
5:22\
from surgery--you have a chance\
to fulfill your call from\
5:27\
the Lord to be His\
ministering daughter.\
5:32\
Those appear to\
be very different\
5:34\
ministering assignments.\
5:35\
Yet they all require\
the preparation\
5:39\
of a powerful, loving\
heart, a fearless faith\
5:43\
that the Lord gives no command\
save He prepares a way,\
5:48\
and a desire to\
go and do for Him.\
5:53\
Because she was prepared,\
the 10-year-old daughter\
5:56\
put her arms around\
her widowed mother\
5:59\
and prayed to know how\
to help her family.\
6:02\
And she keeps at it.\
6:05\
The Relief Society president\
had prepared to minister\
6:08\
before the unexpected\
fire in her area.\
6:11\
She had come to know\
and love the people.\
6:15\
Her faith in Jesus Christ\
had grown over the years\
6:19\
from having received answers\
to her prayers for the Lord\
6:24\
to help her in small\
services for Him.\
6:27\
Because of her long\
preparation, she\
6:30\
was ready and eager to organize\
her sisters to minister\
6:34\
to people and\
families in distress.\
6:39\
A sister recovering in\
a hospital from surgery\
6:42\
was prepared to minister\
to her fellow patients.\
6:46\
She had spent a lifetime\
ministering for the Lord\
6:50\
to every stranger\
as if he or she\
6:53\
was a neighbor and a friend.\
6:55\
When she felt in her\
heart the call to minister\
6:58\
in the hospital, she\
served others so bravely\
7:03\
and with much love\
that the other patients\
7:05\
began to hope she would never\
recover, or at least not soon.\
7:12\
In the same way that\
you prepare to minister,\
7:14\
you can and must\
prepare for your call\
7:17\
to be a leader for the\
Lord when it comes.\
7:20\
It will require faith\
in Jesus Christ rooted\
7:25\
in your deep love of the\
scriptures to lead people\
7:28\
and to teach His\
word without fear.\
7:32\
Then you will be prepared\
to have the Holy Ghost\
7:35\
as your constant companion.\
7:38\
You will be eager\
to say "I will"\
7:40\
when your counselor in\
the Young Women presidency\
7:44\
says, with panic in her voice,\
"Sister Alvarez is sick today.\
7:48\
Who will teach her class?"\
7:50\
It takes much the\
same preparation\
7:53\
for the wonderful day\
when the Lord calls you\
7:56\
to an assignment as a mother.\
8:01\
But it will also take an\
even more loving heart\
8:04\
than you needed earlier.\
8:05\
It will take faith\
in Jesus Christ\
8:09\
beyond what has ever\
been in your heart.\
8:11\
And it will take\
a capacity to pray\
8:15\
for the influence,\
direction, and comfort\
8:18\
of the Holy Ghost beyond\
what you may have felt\
8:21\
was even possible.\
8:24\
Now, you might reasonably ask--I\
can just hear you thinking--how\
8:27\
a man of any age can\
know what mothers need.\
8:32\
[LAUGHTER]\
8:34\
It's a valid question.\
8:36\
[LAUGHTER]\
8:38\
Men can't know\
everything, but we\
8:40\
can learn from lessons\
by revelation from God.\
8:43\
And we can also learn\
much by observation,\
8:47\
when we take the opportunity\
to seek the Spirit to help\
8:51\
us understand what we observe.\
8:54\
I have been observing Kathleen\
Johnson Eyring for the 57 years\
8:58\
that we have been married.\
9:00\
She is the mother of\
four boys and two girls.\
9:04\
To date, she has\
accepted the call\
9:06\
to be a mothering influence\
on more than a hundred\
9:09\
direct family members and\
hundreds more whom she has\
9:12\
adopted into her mother heart.\
9:16\
You remember President\
Nelson's perfect descriptions\
9:20\
of a woman's divine\
mission--including her mission\
9:24\
of mothering: "As mother,\
teacher, or nurturing Saint,\
9:31\
she molds living clay to\
the shape of her hopes.\
9:37\
In partnership with\
God, her divine mission\
9:41\
is to help spirits live\
and souls be lifted.\
9:45\
This is the measure\
of her creation."\
9:49\
As nearly as I can\
discern, my wife, Kathleen,\
9:52\
has followed that charge, given\
to our Father's daughters.\
9:57\
The key appears to be the\
words "she molds living clay\
10:03\
to the shape of her hopes\
... in partnership with God."\
10:07\
Kathy did not force.\
10:10\
She molded.\
10:11\
And she had a\
template for her hopes\
10:14\
to which she tried to mold\
those she loved and mothered.\
10:19\
Her template was the gospel of\
Jesus Christ--as I could see\
10:25\
through prayerful\
observation over the years.\
10:29\
Becoming a covenant woman\
in partnership with God\
10:32\
is how great and good daughters\
have always mothered, led,\
10:38\
ministered, served\
in whatever the place\
10:42\
He has called them\
and prepared for them.\
10:46\
I promise that you will\
find joy in your journey\
10:51\
to your heavenly\
home as you return\
10:53\
to Him as a covenant-keeping\
daughter of God.\
10:59\
I testify that God the Father\
lives and He loves you.\
11:05\
His Beloved Son leads,\
in every detail,\
11:09\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
11:13\
President Russell M. Nelson\
is His living prophet.\
11:17\
And Joseph Smith saw and spoke\
with God the Father and Jesus\
11:22\
Christ in a grove of trees\
in Palmyra, New York.\
11:26\
I know that is true.\
11:28\
I also testify that He\
will answer your prayers.\
11:35\
Your Heavenly Father loves you.\
11:37\
Jesus Christ, your\
Savior, loves you.\
11:43\
And through His Atonement,\
you can be purified and lifted\
11:48\
to the high and holy callings\
which will come to you.\
11:52\
I so testify in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
