Brothers and sisters,\
this is Sammy Ho Ching,\
0:06\
seven months old, watching\
general conference\
0:10\
on television in\
his home last April.\
0:15\
As time approached to\
sustain President Nelson\
0:19\
and the other\
General Authorities,\
0:21\
Sammy's arms were busy\
holding his bottle.\
0:26\
So he did the next best thing.\
0:28\
Sammy gives, Sammy\
gives entirely new\
0:38\
meaning to the concept\
of voting with your feet.\
0:44\
Welcome to this\
semiannual conference\
0:47\
of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
0:52\
To set the stage\
for a discussion\
0:55\
of the meaning of these\
twice-a-year gatherings,\
0:59\
I invoke this scene from\
Luke's New Testament account:\
1:06\
"It came to pass, that as\
[Jesus] was come nigh unto\
1:10\
Jericho, a certain blind man\
sat by the way side begging:\
1:17\
"...\
1:17\
Hearing [a] multitude pass\
by, he asked what it meant.\
1:25\
"...\
1:26\
They told him, that Jesus\
of Nazareth passeth by.\
1:32\
"And he cried, saying,\
Jesus, thou Son of David,\
1:38\
have mercy on me."\
1:42\
Startled at his boldness, the\
crowd tried to silence the man,\
1:47\
but "he cried so much\
the more," it says.\
1:51\
As a result of his\
persistence, he\
1:54\
was brought to Jesus, who\
heard his faith-filled plea\
1:59\
for the restoration of his\
sight, and He healed him.\
2:05\
I am moved by this vivid, little\
vignette every time I read it.\
2:10\
We can sense the man's distress.\
2:13\
We can almost hear him shouting\
for the Savior's attention.\
2:19\
We smile at his refusal\
to be silent--indeed,\
2:23\
his determination to turn the\
volume up when everyone else\
2:27\
was telling him to turn it down.\
2:30\
It is, in and of itself, a sweet\
story of very determined faith.\
2:36\
But as with all scripture,\
the more we read it,\
2:40\
the more we find in it.\
2:43\
One thought that struck\
me only recently is\
2:47\
the good sense this\
man had in having\
2:51\
spiritually sensitive\
people around him.\
2:54\
The entire significance\
of this story\
2:58\
hinges on a handful of\
anonymous women and men who,\
3:06\
when asked by their\
colleague, "What\
3:08\
does this commotion mean?"\
3:10\
had the vision, if you\
will, to identify Christ\
3:15\
as the reason for the clamor;\
He was Meaning Personified.\
3:22\
There is a lesson in this\
little exchange for all of us.\
3:27\
In matters of faith\
and conviction,\
3:31\
it helps to direct your\
inquiry toward those\
3:36\
who actually have some!\
3:38\
"Can the blind lead the blind?"\
3:41\
Jesus once asked.\
3:42\
"[If so,] shall they not\
both fall into the ditch?"\
3:48\
Such a quest for\
faith and conviction\
3:51\
is our purpose in\
these conferences,\
3:55\
and by joining with\
us today you will\
3:57\
realize that this search is\
a broadly shared endeavor.\
4:02\
Look around you.\
4:03\
Here on these grounds you see\
families of all sizes coming\
4:09\
from every direction.\
4:10\
Old friends embrace\
in joyful reunion,\
4:15\
a marvelous choir is warming\
up, and protestors shout\
4:20\
from their favorite soapbox.\
4:22\
Missionaries of an earlier day\
look for former companions,\
4:27\
while recently\
returned missionaries\
4:30\
look for entirely new companions\
(if you know what I mean!).\
4:36\
And more power to you.\
4:41\
And photos?\
4:42\
Heaven help us!\
4:44\
With cell phones\
in every hand, we\
4:47\
have morphed from "every\
member a missionary"\
4:49\
to "every member\
a photographer."\
4:53\
In the midst of all of\
this delightful commotion,\
4:57\
one could justifiably ask,\
"What does it all mean?"\
5:03\
As in our New Testament story,\
those blessed with sight\
5:08\
will recognize that,\
in spite of everything\
5:10\
else this conference\
tradition may offer us,\
5:15\
it will mean little or\
nothing unless we find\
5:19\
Jesus at the center of it all.\
5:23\
To grasp the vision\
we are seeking,\
5:26\
the healing that He promises,\
the significance we somehow\
5:31\
know is here, we must cut\
through the commotion--joyful\
5:36\
as it is--and fix\
our attention on Him.\
5:40\
The prayer of every speaker,\
the hope of all who sing,\
5:46\
the reverence of every guest--we\
are all dedicated to inviting\
5:52\
the Spirit of Him whose Church\
this is, the living Christ,\
5:58\
the Lamb of God,\
the Prince of Peace.\
6:03\
But we don't have to be in a\
conference center to find Him.\
6:07\
When a child reads the Book\
of Mormon for the first time\
6:10\
and is enamored with Abinadi's\
courage or the march of 2,000\
6:16\
stripling warriors,\
we can gently\
6:18\
add that Jesus is the\
omnipresent central figure\
6:24\
in this marvelous\
chronicle, standing\
6:27\
like a colossus over\
virtually every page of it\
6:31\
and providing the link to all\
of the other faith-promoting\
6:36\
figures in it.\
6:38\
Likewise, when a friend is\
learning about our faith,\
6:41\
she or he can be a bit\
overwhelmed by some\
6:46\
of the unique elements\
and unfamiliar vocabulary\
6:49\
of our religious\
practice--dietary restrictions,\
6:54\
self-reliance supplies, pioneer\
treks, digitized family trees,\
7:01\
with an untold number\
of stake centers,\
7:04\
where some have undoubtedly\
expected to be served a fine\
7:08\
charbroiled sirloin,\
medium rare.\
7:11\
So, as our new\
friends experience\
7:14\
a multitude of new\
sights and sounds,\
7:17\
we must point past\
the hustle and bustle\
7:21\
and concentrate them\
on the meaning of it\
7:24\
all, on the beating heart\
of the eternal gospel:\
7:29\
the love of Heavenly\
Parents, the atoning gift\
7:34\
of a divine Son, the comforting\
guidance of the Holy Ghost,\
7:40\
the latter-day Restoration\
of all these truths,\
7:44\
and so much more.\
7:47\
When one goes to the holy\
temple for the first time,\
7:50\
he or she may be somewhat\
awestruck by that experience.\
7:55\
Our job is to ensure\
that the sacred symbols\
7:59\
and revealed rituals,\
the ceremonial clothing,\
8:02\
and the visual\
presentations never distract\
8:06\
but rather point toward the\
Savior, whom we are there\
8:10\
to worship.\
8:11\
The temple is His house,\
and He should be uppermost\
8:16\
in our minds and hearts--the\
majestic doctrine of Christ\
8:21\
pervading our very being\
as it pervades the temple\
8:26\
ordinances--from the time\
we read the inscription over\
8:31\
the front door to the\
very last moment we spend\
8:35\
in the building.\
8:36\
Amid all the wonder\
we encounter,\
8:40\
we are to see above all else the\
meaning of Jesus in the temple.\
8:48\
Consider the swirl\
of bold initiatives\
8:51\
and new announcements in the\
Church in these recent months.\
8:55\
As we minister to one another\
or refine our Sabbath experience\
9:00\
or embrace a new program\
for children and youth,\
9:04\
we will miss the real reason\
for these revelatory adjustments\
9:09\
if we see them as disparate,\
unrelated elements rather than\
9:16\
an interrelated effort to\
help us build more firmly\
9:20\
on the Rock of our Salvation.\
9:23\
Surely, surely this is\
what President Russell M.\
9:28\
Nelson intends in having\
us use the revealed name\
9:33\
of the Church.\
9:34\
If Jesus--His name, His\
doctrine, His example,\
9:40\
His divinity--if He can be\
at the center of our worship,\
9:45\
we will be reinforcing the\
great truth Alma once taught:\
9:51\
"There be many things\
to come; [but] behold,\
9:57\
there is one thing which is of\
more importance than they all\
10:01\
...\
10:02\
the Redeemer [who] liveth\
and cometh among his people."\
10:09\
One concluding thought.\
10:11\
Joseph Smith's 19th-century\
frontier environment\
10:16\
was aflame with competing\
crowds of Christian witnesses.\
10:22\
But in the tumult they created,\
these exuberant revivalists\
10:27\
were, ironically, obscuring\
the very Savior young\
10:33\
Joseph so earnestly sought.\
10:36\
Battling what he called\
"darkness and confusion,"\
10:40\
he retreated to the solitude\
of a grove of trees,\
10:44\
where he saw and heard\
a more glorious witness\
10:49\
of the Savior's centrality\
to the gospel than anything\
10:53\
we have mentioned\
here this morning.\
10:55\
With a gift of sight\
unimagined and unanticipated,\
11:02\
Joseph beheld in vision\
his Heavenly Father,\
11:06\
the great God of the\
universe, and Jesus Christ,\
11:10\
His perfect Only Begotten Son.\
11:15\
Then the Father set the\
example we have been applauding\
11:19\
this morning: He\
pointed to Jesus,\
11:22\
saying: "This is My Beloved Son.\
11:26\
Hear Him!"\
11:28\
No greater expression of\
Jesus's divine identity,\
11:34\
His primacy in the\
plan of salvation,\
11:38\
and His standing\
in the eyes of God\
11:41\
could ever exceed that short,\
seven-word declaration.\
11:50\
Commotion and\
confusion and crowds?\
11:53\
Even contention?\
11:55\
There is plenty of\
all that in our world.\
11:59\
Indeed, skeptics\
and the faithful\
12:04\
still contend over this\
vision and virtually\
12:08\
all else I have\
referred to today.\
12:11\
In case you may be striving\
to see more clearly\
12:17\
and to find meaning in the midst\
of a multitude of opinions,\
12:23\
I point you toward that\
same Jesus and bear\
12:28\
apostolic witness of\
Joseph Smith's experience,\
12:33\
coming as it did\
some 1,800 years\
12:38\
after our blind friend\
received his sight\
12:43\
on the ancient Jericho Road.\
12:46\
I testify with these\
two and a host of others\
12:52\
down through time that surely\
the most thrilling sight\
12:57\
and sound in life is that\
of Jesus not only passing\
13:03\
by but His coming to\
us, stopping beside us,\
13:10\
and making His abode with us.\
13:15\
Sisters and brothers, through\
the incessant din and drumbeat\
13:21\
of our day, may we\
strive to see Christ\
13:27\
at the center of our lives, of\
our faith, and of our service.\
13:34\
That is where true meaning lies.\
13:38\
And if some days our vision is\
limited or our confidence has\
13:44\
waned or our belief is being\
tested and refined--as surely\
13:50\
it will be--may we cry out\
then the louder, "Jesus,\
13:56\
thou son of David,\
have mercy on me."\
14:03\
I promise with apostolic\
fervor and prophetic conviction\
14:09\
that He will hear you and will\
say, soon or late, "Receive thy\
14:17\
sight: thy faith\
hath saved thee."\
14:23\
Welcome to general conference.\
14:26\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
