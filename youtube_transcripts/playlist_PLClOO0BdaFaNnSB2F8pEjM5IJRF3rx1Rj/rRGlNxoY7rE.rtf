My dear sisters in the\
gospel of Jesus Christ,\
0:05\
I greet you as divinely\
assigned guardians\
0:10\
of the eternal family.\
0:13\
President Russell M.\
Nelson has taught us\
0:17\
"This Church was restored so\
that families could be formed,\
0:22\
sealed, and exalted eternally."\
0:28\
That teaching has\
important implications\
0:32\
for persons who identify\
as lesbian, gay, bisexual,\
0:37\
or transgender, commonly\
referred to as LGBT.\
0:43\
President Nelson has also\
reminded us that we don't "have\
0:48\
to always agree with each\
other to love each other."\
0:53\
These prophetic teachings\
are important for family\
0:57\
discussions to answer\
the questions of children\
1:00\
and youth.\
1:02\
I have prayerfully\
sought inspiration\
1:05\
to speak to this audience\
because you are uniquely\
1:10\
affected by these\
questions, which\
1:12\
directly or indirectly affect\
every family in the Church.\
1:19\
I begin with what Jesus\
taught were the two\
1:22\
great commandments.\
1:24\
"Thou shalt love the Lord\
thy God with all thy heart,\
1:28\
and with all thy soul,\
and with all thy mind.\
1:33\
"This is the first\
and great commandment.\
1:36\
"And the second is like unto it,\
Thou shalt love thy neighbour\
1:40\
as thyself."\
1:44\
This means we are\
commanded to love everyone,\
1:48\
since Jesus's parable\
of the good Samaritan\
1:51\
teaches that everyone\
is our neighbor.\
1:55\
But our zeal to keep\
this second commandment\
1:59\
must not cause us\
to forget the first,\
2:03\
to love God with all our\
heart, soul, and mind.\
2:07\
We show that love by\
"keep[ing] [His] commandments."\
2:12\
God requires us to obey His\
commandments because only\
2:17\
through that obedience,\
including repentance,\
2:20\
can we return to\
live in His presence\
2:23\
and become perfect as He is.\
2:28\
In his recent talk to the\
young adults of the Church,\
2:31\
President Russell M.\
Nelson spoke of what\
2:34\
he called the "strong\
connection between God's love\
2:39\
and His laws."\
2:41\
The law that applies\
most significantly\
2:46\
to the issues relating to\
those identifying as LGBT\
2:52\
is God's law of marriage and\
its companion law of chastity.\
3:00\
Both are essential in our Father\
in Heaven's plan of salvation\
3:06\
for His children.\
3:07\
As President Nelson\
taught, "God's laws\
3:11\
are motivated entirely by\
His infinite love for us\
3:16\
and His desire for us to\
become all we can become."\
3:24\
PRESIDENT NELSON TAUGHT:\
"Many countries ...\
3:26\
have legalized\
same-sex marriage.\
3:29\
As members of the Church, we\
respect the laws of the land\
3:32\
..., including civil marriage.\
3:35\
The truth is, however,\
that in the beginning ...\
3:39\
marriage was ordained by God!\
3:42\
And to this day it\
is defined by Him\
3:45\
as being between\
a man and a woman.\
3:48\
God has not changed His\
definition of marriage."\
3:55\
PRESIDENT NELSON CONTINUED:\
"God has also not changed\
3:59\
[the] law of chastity.\
4:01\
Requirements to enter the\
temple have not changed."\
4:07\
President Nelson\
reminded all of us\
4:09\
that "our commission as Apostles\
is to teach nothing but truth.\
4:14\
That commission does not\
give [Apostles] the authority\
4:19\
to modify divine law."\
4:25\
Thus, my sisters, the\
leaders of the Church\
4:28\
must always teach\
the unique importance\
4:32\
of marriage between\
a man and a woman\
4:35\
and the related law of chastity.\
4:41\
The work of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
4:44\
is ultimately concerned\
with preparing\
4:48\
the children of God for\
the celestial kingdom,\
4:52\
and most particularly for\
its highest glory, exaltation\
4:57\
or eternal life.\
4:59\
That highest destiny is only\
possible through marriage\
5:04\
for eternity.\
5:05\
Eternal life includes the\
creative powers inherent\
5:11\
in the combination of male and\
female--what modern revelation\
5:15\
describes as "the continuation\
of the seeds forever and ever."\
5:23\
In his BYU talk President Nelson\
taught, "Abiding by God's laws\
5:29\
will keep you safe\
as you progress\
5:32\
toward eventual exaltation."\
5:37\
That is to become like God,\
with the exalted life and divine\
5:43\
potential of our\
Heavenly Parents.\
5:46\
That is the destiny we\
desire for all we love.\
5:51\
Because of that love, we\
cannot let our love supersede\
5:57\
the commandments and the\
plan and work of God,\
6:00\
which we know will bring\
those we love their greatest\
6:04\
happiness.\
6:07\
But there are many\
we love, including\
6:09\
some who have the restored\
gospel, who do not\
6:12\
believe in or\
choose not to follow\
6:15\
God's commandments\
about marriage\
6:17\
and the law of chastity.\
6:19\
What about them?\
6:21\
God's doctrine shows that\
all of us are His children\
6:25\
and that He has\
created us to have joy.\
6:29\
Modern revelation teaches\
that God has provided a plan\
6:35\
for a mortal experience\
in which all can choose\
6:39\
obedience to seek\
His highest blessings\
6:43\
or make choices that lead to one\
of the less glorious kingdoms.\
6:48\
Because of God's great love\
for all of His children,\
6:53\
those lesser kingdoms\
are still more wonderful\
6:57\
than mortals can comprehend.\
6:59\
The Atonement of Jesus Christ\
makes all of this possible,\
7:04\
as He "glorifies the\
Father, and saves\
7:10\
all the works of his hands."\
7:17\
I have spoken of the\
first commandment,\
7:19\
but what of the second?\
7:20\
How do we keep the commandment\
to love our neighbors?\
7:25\
We seek to persuade our members\
that those who follow lesbian,\
7:30\
gay, bisexual, or transgender\
teachings and actions\
7:36\
should be treated with the love\
our Savior commands us to show\
7:41\
toward all our neighbors.\
7:44\
Thus, when same-sex\
marriage was declared legal,\
7:48\
the First Presidency and\
Quorum of the Twelve declared:\
7:52\
"The gospel of Jesus Christ\
teaches us to love and treat\
7:57\
all people with kindness\
and civility--even when we\
8:01\
disagree.\
8:02\
We affirm that those who avail\
themselves of laws or court\
8:07\
rulings authorizing\
same-sex marriage\
8:11\
should not be treated\
disrespectfully."\
8:17\
Further, we must\
never persecute those\
8:20\
who do not share our\
beliefs and commitments.\
8:23\
Regretfully, some persons\
facing these issues\
8:28\
continue to feel\
marginalized and rejected\
8:32\
by some members and leaders\
in our families, wards,\
8:37\
and stakes.\
8:39\
We must all strive to be\
kinder and more civil.\
8:45\
For reasons we do\
not understand,\
8:47\
we have different challenges\
in our mortal experiences.\
8:51\
But we do know that God\
will help each of us\
8:54\
overcome these challenges if\
we sincerely seek His help.\
9:00\
After suffering and repenting\
for violations of laws\
9:05\
we have been taught,\
we are all destined\
9:08\
for a kingdom of glory.\
9:10\
The ultimate and\
final judgment will\
9:13\
be by the Lord, who alone has\
the required knowledge, wisdom,\
9:19\
and grace to judge each of us.\
9:23\
Meanwhile, we must try to keep\
both of the great commandments.\
9:28\
To do so we walk a fine line\
between law and love--keeping\
9:33\
the commandments and\
walking the covenant path,\
9:37\
while loving our\
neighbors along the way.\
9:40\
This walk requires us to seek\
divine inspiration on what\
9:44\
to support and what\
to oppose and how\
9:48\
to love and listen respectfully\
and teach in the process.\
9:53\
Our walk demands that we not\
compromise on commandments\
9:57\
but show forth a full measure\
of understanding and love.\
10:01\
Our walk must be\
considerate of children\
10:05\
who are uncertain about\
their sexual orientation,\
10:10\
but it discourages\
premature labeling\
10:13\
because, in most children,\
such uncertainty decreases\
10:17\
significantly over time.\
10:21\
Our walk opposes recruitment\
away from the covenant path,\
10:25\
and it denies support to any who\
lead people away from the Lord.\
10:31\
In all of this we\
remember that God\
10:34\
promises hope and ultimate\
joy and blessings for all\
10:40\
who keep His commandments.\
10:45\
Mothers and fathers\
and all of us\
10:46\
are responsible to teach both\
of the two great commandments.\
10:52\
For the women of the\
Church, President Spencer W.\
10:56\
Kimball described that duty\
in this great prophecy:\
11:01\
"Much of the major growth\
that is coming to the Church\
11:05\
in the last days will come\
because many of the good women\
11:09\
of the world ... will be drawn\
to the Church in large numbers.\
11:14\
This will happen to the degree\
that the women of the Church\
11:18\
reflect righteousness and\
articulateness in their lives\
11:23\
and to the degree that the\
women of the Church are seen\
11:27\
as distinct and different ...\
from the women of the world.\
11:30\
...\
11:30\
Thus it will be that female\
exemplars of the Church\
11:35\
will be a significant\
force in both\
11:38\
the numerical and\
the spiritual growth\
11:41\
of the Church in the last days."\
11:47\
Speaking of that prophecy,\
President Russell M. Nelson\
11:50\
declared that "the day that\
President Kimball foresaw\
11:54\
is today.\
11:55\
You are the women he foresaw!"\
12:00\
Little did we who heard that\
prophecy 40 years ago realize\
12:05\
that among those the women\
of this Church may save\
12:09\
will be their own dear friends\
and family who are currently\
12:14\
influenced by worldly priorities\
and devilish distortions.\
12:20\
My prayer and\
blessing is that you\
12:23\
will teach and act to fulfill\
that prophecy, in the name\
12:28\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
