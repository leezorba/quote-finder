As I was leaving a Young\
Women camp this summer,\
0:03\
a sweet young woman\
handed me a note.\
0:06\
In it, she asked, "How\
can I tell when God is\
0:10\
trying to tell me something?"\
0:11\
I love her question.\
0:14\
Our souls long for a connection\
with our heavenly home.\
0:18\
We want to feel\
needed and useful.\
0:21\
But at times we\
struggle to distinguish\
0:23\
between our own thoughts\
and the gentle impressions\
0:26\
of the Spirit.\
0:28\
Prophets, ancient\
and modern, have\
0:30\
taught that if something\
"invites and entices to do\
0:34\
good, it comes from Christ."\
0:37\
President Russell M.\
Nelson has extended\
0:40\
a simple, powerful invitation:\
"My beloved brothers\
0:44\
and sisters, I plead\
with you to increase\
0:48\
your spiritual capacity\
to receive revelation.\
0:51\
...\
0:52\
Choose to do the\
spiritual work required\
0:55\
to enjoy the gift\
of the Holy Ghost\
0:57\
and hear the voice of the\
Spirit more frequently\
1:01\
and more clearly."\
1:03\
My desire this morning\
is to speak to you\
1:06\
from my heart about\
four ways to increase\
1:09\
your spiritual capacity\
to receive revelation.\
1:14\
NUMBER ONE: Be intentional\
about creating time and space\
1:19\
to hear God's voice.\
1:21\
As you use your agency to\
carve out time every day\
1:26\
to draw close to God's\
voice, especially\
1:29\
in the Book of Mormon,\
over time His voice\
1:32\
will become clearer and\
more familiar to you.\
1:36\
In contrast, the\
distractions and noise\
1:39\
that fill the world and\
our homes and our lives\
1:41\
can make it more difficult\
to hear His voice.\
1:44\
These distractions can so\
occupy our minds and hearts\
1:49\
that we leave no room\
for the gentle promptings\
1:52\
of the Holy Ghost.\
1:54\
The Prophet Joseph Smith\
taught that most often God\
1:57\
reveals Himself "to individuals\
in private, in their chamber;\
2:02\
in the wilderness or fields,\
and that generally without noise\
2:07\
or tumult."\
2:09\
Satan wants to separate\
us from God's voice\
2:12\
by keeping us out of\
those quiet places.\
2:15\
If God speaks in a\
still, small voice,\
2:18\
you and I need to draw\
close to hear Him.\
2:21\
Just imagine what would happen\
if we were as intent on staying\
2:26\
connected with heaven as we are\
on staying connected to Wi-Fi!\
2:31\
Pick a time and place and listen\
for God's voice every day.\
2:36\
And keep the sacred\
appointment with exactness,\
2:40\
for so very much depends on it!\
2:44\
NUMBER TWO: Act without delay.\
2:47\
When you receive promptings\
and then act with intention,\
2:51\
the Lord can use you.\
2:53\
The more you act,\
the more familiar\
2:56\
the voice of the Spirit becomes.\
2:58\
You will increasingly recognize\
God's guidance and that He is\
3:02\
"willing ... to reveal\
His mind and will."\
3:05\
If you delay, you might\
forget the prompting\
3:08\
or miss the chance to\
help someone for God.\
3:13\
NUMBER THREE: Get your\
errand from the Lord.\
3:17\
The prayer Heavenly Father\
seems eager to answer\
3:20\
is our plea to be led to\
someone who needs our help.\
3:23\
President Eyring has taught\
us to seek revelation\
3:27\
by asking God who\
we can help for Him.\
3:32\
"If you ask questions like\
that, the Holy Ghost will come\
3:36\
and you'll feel\
nudges about things\
3:37\
you can do for other people.\
3:39\
When you go and do those things,\
you're on the Lord's errand,\
3:43\
and when you're on\
the Lord's errand,\
3:46\
you qualify for the\
gift of the Holy Ghost."\
3:50\
You can pray and ask\
the Lord for an errand.\
3:53\
As you do, He can use\
your ordinary skills\
3:57\
to accomplish His\
extraordinary work.\
4:01\
My grandfather, Fritz\
Hjalmar Lundgren,\
4:04\
immigrated from Sweden\
when he was 19 years old.\
4:08\
He arrived in America alone,\
with a suitcase and six years\
4:13\
of formal schooling.\
4:14\
Unable to speak any English,\
he made his way to Oregon\
4:19\
and worked there as\
a lumberjack and then\
4:21\
later, with my grandmother\
and mother, joined the Church.\
4:25\
He never presided over a ward,\
but as a faithful home teacher,\
4:29\
he brought more than\
50 different families\
4:32\
into Church activity.\
4:34\
How did he do that?\
4:36\
After Grandpa's\
death, I was going\
4:38\
through a box of\
his papers, and I\
4:40\
came across a letter\
written by a man who\
4:42\
had come back to church\
because of Grandpa's love.\
4:45\
The letter read, "Brother\
Fritz's secret, I believe,\
4:49\
is that he is always on an\
errand for Heavenly Father."\
4:54\
That letter was from\
Brother Wayne Simonis.\
4:57\
Grandpa visited him and got to\
know each member of the family.\
5:00\
In time, Grandpa told them that\
they were needed and invited\
5:04\
them to attend church.\
5:05\
But that Sunday, Brother Simonis\
awoke with a dilemma--he had\
5:10\
not finished\
reroofing his house,\
5:11\
and rain was expected that week.\
5:14\
He decided that\
he'd go to church,\
5:16\
shake hands with Grandpa,\
and then leave and go home\
5:19\
and finish the roof.\
5:20\
His family could attend\
sacrament meeting without him.\
5:24\
His plan was working just\
fine until, on the roof,\
5:27\
he heard someone\
climbing the ladder.\
5:29\
In his words: "When\
I looked up, ...\
5:33\
standing at the top of the\
ladder was Brother Fritz.\
5:36\
He just gave me that big smile.\
5:38\
At first, I was\
embarrassed and felt\
5:40\
like a little kid getting\
caught for skipping school.\
5:43\
Then ...\
5:44\
I felt anger.\
5:46\
[But Brother Fritz just]\
took off his suit coat\
5:49\
and hung it on the ladder.\
5:50\
As he rolled up the\
sleeves of his white shirt,\
5:53\
he turned to me and\
said, 'Brother Simonis,\
5:56\
do you have another hammer?\
5:58\
This work must be very important\
or you wouldn't have left\
6:01\
your family, and if it's that\
important, I want to help you.'\
6:06\
As I looked into his eyes, I\
saw only kindness and Christlike\
6:10\
love.\
6:11\
My anger left. ...\
6:12\
I laid my tools down that Sunday\
and followed my good friend\
6:16\
down the ladder and\
back to the chapel."\
6:20\
Grandpa had obtained his\
errand from the Lord,\
6:23\
and he knew he was to\
seek out lost sheep.\
6:26\
Just as the four men who\
carried their friend with palsy\
6:30\
onto a roof and\
then let him down\
6:32\
to be healed by\
Jesus Christ, so too\
6:35\
did Grandpa's errand\
take him to a rooftop.\
6:39\
The Lord sends revelation to\
those seeking to help others.\
6:44\
AND FOUR: Believe and trust.\
6:47\
Recently, I read\
in the scriptures\
6:49\
about another great\
missionary who obtained\
6:51\
his errand from the Lord.\
6:53\
Aaron was teaching the\
king of the Lamanites, who\
6:56\
wondered why Aaron's\
brother Ammon had not also\
6:59\
come to teach him.\
7:00\
"And Aaron said unto the king:\
Behold, the Spirit of the Lord\
7:05\
has called him another way."\
7:10\
THE SPIRIT SPOKE TO\
MY HEART: each of us\
7:12\
has a different\
mission to perform,\
7:14\
and at times the Spirit may\
call us in "another way."\
7:18\
There are many ways to\
build the kingdom of God\
7:21\
as covenant-making,\
covenant-keeping disciples\
7:24\
of Jesus Christ.\
7:26\
As His faithful\
disciple, you can\
7:29\
receive personal\
inspiration and revelation,\
7:32\
consistent with\
His commandments,\
7:35\
that is tailored to you.\
7:37\
You have unique missions\
and roles to perform in life\
7:41\
and will be given unique\
guidance to fulfill them.\
7:45\
Nephi, the brother of Jared, and\
even Moses all had a large body\
7:50\
of water to cross--and\
each did it differently.\
7:53\
Nephi worked "timbers\
of curious workmanship."\
7:56\
The brother of\
Jared built barges\
7:58\
that were "tight\
like unto a dish,"\
8:00\
and Moses "walked upon dry\
land in the midst of the sea."\
8:05\
They each received personalized\
direction, tailored to them,\
8:10\
and each trusted and acted.\
8:13\
The Lord is mindful\
of those who obey\
8:16\
and, in the words of Nephi,\
"will prepare a way for [us to]\
8:20\
accomplish the thing\
which he commandeth."\
8:22\
Note that Nephi says,\
"a way"--not "the way."\
8:29\
Do we miss or dismiss\
personal errands from the Lord\
8:32\
because He has prepared "a\
way" different than the one\
8:35\
we expect?\
8:38\
My grandpa was led to an unusual\
place--in a suit, on a rooftop,\
8:43\
on a Sunday.\
8:45\
Trust God to lead you, even\
if that way looks different\
8:49\
than you expected or is\
different from others.\
8:53\
Latter-day Saints come\
in many shapes and sizes,\
8:56\
but "all are alike unto\
God"--"black and white,\
9:00\
bond and free, male and\
female," single and married,\
9:04\
rich and poor, young and old,\
lifelong member and recent\
9:08\
convert.\
9:09\
No matter who you are or\
what you're dealing with,\
9:12\
you are invited to\
the Lord's table.\
9:16\
As seeking and doing\
the will of the Father\
9:18\
becomes the cadence\
of your daily life,\
9:20\
you will, of course, be\
led to change and repent.\
9:25\
Well, the Church's new\
program for children and youth\
9:27\
is built on the foundation of\
learning to seek revelation,\
9:32\
discovering what the\
Lord would have us do,\
9:35\
and then acting\
on that direction.\
9:37\
Each one of us, regardless\
of age or circumstance,\
9:41\
can strive to seek,\
receive, and act.\
9:46\
As you follow this eternal\
pattern ordained for our day,\
9:50\
you will draw nearer to Jesus\
Christ--His love, His light,\
9:55\
His direction, His peace, His\
healing and enabling power.\
10:00\
And you will increase\
your spiritual capacity\
10:03\
to become an everyday\
instrument of His hands\
10:07\
in accomplishing His great work.\
10:09\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
