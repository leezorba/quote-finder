The Book of Mormon prophet\
Enos, Lehi's grandson,\
0:06\
wrote of a singular\
experience that\
0:09\
happened earlier in his life.\
0:11\
While hunting alone\
in the forest,\
0:13\
Enos began pondering on the\
teachings of his father, Jacob.\
0:19\
He related, "The words which\
I had often heard my father\
0:24\
speak concerning eternal life,\
and the joy of the saints,\
0:28\
sunk deep into my heart."\
0:31\
In the spiritual\
hunger of his soul,\
0:34\
Enos knelt in prayer, a\
remarkable prayer that\
0:37\
lasted through the day and\
into the night, a prayer that\
0:41\
brought him crucial revelations,\
assurances, and promises.\
0:47\
There is much to be learned\
from Enos's experience,\
0:50\
but today what\
stands out in my mind\
0:53\
is Enos's memory of his\
father speaking often\
0:57\
of "the joy of the saints."\
1:01\
In this conference three years\
ago, President Russell M.\
1:05\
Nelson spoke of joy.\
1:07\
Among other things, he said:\
1:10\
"The joy we feel\
has little to do\
1:12\
with the circumstances of\
our lives and everything\
1:16\
to do with the\
focus of our lives.\
1:19\
"When the focus of our lives is\
on God's plan of salvation ...\
1:24\
and Jesus Christ and His gospel,\
we can feel joy regardless\
1:29\
of what is happening--or\
not happening--in our lives.\
1:33\
Joy comes from and\
because of Him. ...\
1:36\
For Latter-day Saints,\
Jesus Christ is joy!"\
1:43\
Saints are those who have\
entered into the gospel\
1:46\
covenant through baptism\
and are striving to follow\
1:49\
Christ as His disciples.\
1:52\
Thus, "the joy of\
the saints" denotes\
1:55\
the joy of becoming Christlike.\
1:59\
I would like to\
speak of the joy that\
2:01\
comes from keeping\
His commandments,\
2:03\
the joy that arises\
from overcoming sorrow\
2:07\
and weakness through Him, and\
the joy inherent in serving\
2:11\
as He served.\
2:13\
The joy of keeping\
Christ's commandments.\
2:16\
We live in a hedonistic\
age, when many\
2:19\
question the importance\
of the Lord's commandments\
2:22\
or simply ignore them.\
2:24\
Not infrequently,\
people who flout\
2:26\
divine directives such\
as the law of chastity,\
2:30\
the standard of honesty,\
the holiness of the Sabbath\
2:34\
seem to prosper and enjoy the\
good things of life, at times\
2:38\
even more so than those who\
are striving to be obedient.\
2:42\
Some begin to wonder if the\
effort and sacrifices are\
2:45\
worth it.\
2:47\
The ancient people of\
Israel once complained:\
2:51\
"It is vain to serve\
God: and what profit\
2:54\
is it that we have\
kept his ordinance,\
2:56\
and that we have\
walked mournfully\
2:58\
before the Lord of hosts?\
3:01\
"And now we call\
the proud happy;\
3:03\
yea, they that work wickedness\
are set up; yea, they\
3:07\
that tempt God are\
even delivered."\
3:10\
Just wait, said the\
Lord, until "that day\
3:13\
when I make up my jewels."\
3:14\
"Then shall ye ... discern\
between the righteous\
3:17\
and the wicked, between him\
that serveth God and him that\
3:21\
serveth him not."\
3:23\
The wicked may "have joy in\
their works for a season,"\
3:26\
but it is always temporary.\
3:29\
The joy of the\
Saints is enduring.\
3:33\
God sees things in\
their true perspective,\
3:35\
and He shares that\
perspective with us\
3:37\
through His commandments,\
effectively guiding us\
3:41\
around the pitfalls and\
potholes of mortality\
3:44\
toward eternal joy.\
3:45\
The Prophet Joseph\
Smith explained:\
3:48\
"When His commandments teach\
us it is in view of eternity;\
3:53\
for we are looked upon by God\
as though we were in eternity.\
3:57\
God dwells in eternity and\
does not view things as we do."\
4:02\
I haven't met anyone who\
found the gospel later in life\
4:05\
that didn't wish it\
could have been earlier.\
4:07\
"Oh, the poor choices, the\
mistakes I could have avoided,"\
4:11\
they will say.\
4:12\
The Lord's commandments\
are our guide\
4:15\
to better choices\
and happier outcomes.\
4:17\
How we ought to\
rejoice and thank Him\
4:20\
for showing us this\
more excellent way.\
4:24\
As a teenager, Sister\
Kalombo Rosette Kamwanya\
4:28\
from the DR Congo, now serving\
in the Cote d'Ivoire Abidjan\
4:32\
West Mission, fasted and\
prayed for three days\
4:36\
to find the direction\
God wanted her to take.\
4:40\
In a remarkable\
night vision, she\
4:43\
was shown two\
buildings, a chapel\
4:46\
and what she now\
realizes was a temple.\
4:49\
She began to search and\
soon found the chapel\
4:53\
she had seen in her dream.\
4:55\
The sign said, "The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
4:59\
Saints."\
5:01\
Sister Kamwanya was baptized\
and then her mother and her six\
5:05\
brothers.\
5:06\
Sister Kamwanya said, "When\
I received the gospel,\
5:10\
I felt like a captured bird\
that had been liberated.\
5:13\
My heart was filled\
with joy. ...\
5:16\
I had the assurance\
that God loves me."\
5:20\
Keeping the Lord's\
commandments enables us\
5:22\
more fully and more\
easily to feel His love.\
5:25\
The strait and narrow\
path of the commandments\
5:28\
leads directly to\
the tree of life.\
5:30\
And the tree and its fruit, the\
sweetest and "most desirable\
5:34\
above all things,"\
are a representation\
5:37\
of the love of God\
and fill the soul\
5:39\
"with exceedingly great joy."\
5:43\
SAID THE SAVIOR: "If ye\
keep my commandments,\
5:45\
ye shall abide in\
my love; even as I\
5:48\
have kept my Father's\
commandments,\
5:50\
and abide in his love.\
5:53\
"These things have\
I spoken unto you,\
5:55\
that my joy might remain\
in you, and that your joy\
5:59\
might be full."\
6:01\
Second, the joy of\
overcoming through Christ.\
6:05\
Even when we are\
found faithfully\
6:07\
keeping the commandments,\
there are trials and tragedies\
6:10\
that could interrupt our joy.\
6:12\
But as we strive to\
overcome these challenges\
6:15\
with the Savior's\
help, it preserves\
6:18\
both the joy we feel now\
and the joy we anticipate.\
6:22\
Christ reassured His\
disciples, "In the world\
6:25\
ye shall have tribulation:\
but be of good cheer;\
6:28\
I have overcome the world."\
6:31\
It is in turning to Him, obeying\
Him, binding ourselves to Him\
6:37\
that trial and sorrow\
are turned to joy.\
6:41\
I mention one example.\
6:45\
In 1989, Jack\
Rushton was serving\
6:47\
as president of the\
Irvine California Stake,\
6:51\
in the United States.\
6:52\
During a family vacation\
on the California coast,\
6:56\
Jack was bodysurfing\
when a wave swept him\
6:59\
into a submerged rock,\
breaking his neck\
7:02\
and severely injuring\
his spinal cord.\
7:05\
Jack said later, "The instant\
I hit, I knew I was paralyzed."\
7:10\
He could no longer talk or\
even breathe on his own.\
7:15\
Family, friends,\
and stake members\
7:17\
rallied around Brother\
Rushton and his wife, Jo Anne,\
7:21\
and, among other\
things, remodeled\
7:23\
a section of their home to\
accommodate Jack's wheelchair.\
7:26\
Jo Anne became Jack's\
principal caregiver\
7:29\
for the next 23 years.\
7:32\
Referring to Book of\
Mormon accounts of how\
7:36\
the Lord visited his\
people in their afflictions\
7:38\
and made their burdens\
light, Jo Anne said,\
7:42\
"I am often amazed at\
the lightness of heart I\
7:45\
feel in caring for my husband."\
7:49\
An alteration to his\
respiration system\
7:52\
restored Jack's ability to\
speak, and within the year\
7:56\
Jack was called as Gospel\
Doctrine teacher and stake\
7:59\
patriarch.\
8:01\
When he would give a\
patriarchal blessing,\
8:04\
another priesthood holder\
placed Brother Rushton's hand\
8:07\
on the head of the person\
receiving the blessing\
8:09\
and supported his hand and\
arm during the blessing.\
8:13\
Jack passed away on\
Christmas Day 2012,\
8:18\
after 22 years of\
devoted service.\
8:22\
Once in an interview,\
Jack observed:\
8:26\
"Problems will come\
into all ... our lives;\
8:29\
it's [just] part of ...\
being here ... on this earth.\
8:33\
And some people think that\
religion or having faith in God\
8:36\
will protect you\
from bad things.\
8:39\
I don't think that's the point.\
8:41\
I think the point is that\
if our faith is strong,\
8:45\
that when bad things\
happen, which they will,\
8:48\
we'll be able to deal with them.\
8:51\
...\
8:51\
My faith never wavered,\
but that didn't mean\
8:55\
that I didn't have depressions.\
8:57\
I think for the first\
time in my life,\
9:00\
I was pushed to the\
limit, and literally\
9:03\
there was nowhere to turn,\
and so I turned to the Lord,\
9:06\
and to this day, I feel\
a spontaneity of joy."\
9:12\
This is a day of sometimes\
merciless attacks\
9:15\
in social media and in\
person against those\
9:19\
who seek to uphold the\
Lord's standard in dress,\
9:22\
entertainment,\
and sexual purity.\
9:24\
It is often the youth and\
young adults among the Saints,\
9:28\
as well as women\
and mothers, who\
9:30\
bear this cross of\
mocking and persecution.\
9:34\
It is not easy to\
rise above such abuse,\
9:37\
but remember the\
words of Peter: "If ye\
9:40\
be reproached for\
the name of Christ,\
9:42\
happy are ye; for\
the spirit of glory\
9:47\
and of God resteth upon you:\
on their part he is evil\
9:52\
spoken of, but on your\
part he is glorified."\
9:57\
In the Garden of\
Eden, Adam and Eve\
9:59\
were "in a state of\
innocence, having no joy,\
10:02\
for they knew no misery."\
10:04\
Now, as accountable\
beings, we find joy\
10:08\
in overcoming misery\
in whatever form,\
10:11\
whether it be sin, trial,\
weakness, or any other obstacle\
10:16\
to happiness.\
10:17\
This is the joy of sensing\
progress in the path\
10:21\
of discipleship; the joy of\
"having received a remission\
10:25\
of ... sins, and having\
peace of conscience";\
10:28\
the joy of feeling one's\
soul expand and grow through\
10:33\
the grace of Christ.\
10:36\
Finally, the joy of\
serving as Christ.\
10:40\
The Savior finds joy in\
bringing to pass our immortality\
10:45\
and eternal life.\
10:46\
In speaking of the\
Savior's Atonement,\
10:49\
President Russell\
M. Nelson said:\
10:52\
"As in all things, Jesus Christ\
is our ultimate exemplar,\
10:57\
'who for the joy that was set\
before him endured the cross.'\
11:01\
Think of that!\
11:03\
In order for Him to endure the\
most excruciating experience\
11:06\
ever endured on earth,\
our Savior focused on joy!\
11:12\
"And what was the joy\
that was set before Him?\
11:15\
Surely it included the joy of\
cleansing [and] healing ...\
11:19\
and strengthening us; the joy of\
paying for the sins of all who\
11:24\
would repent; the joy of making\
it possible for you and me\
11:27\
to return home--clean\
and worthy--to live with\
11:31\
our Heavenly Parents\
and families."\
11:36\
Similarly, the joy\
"set before us"\
11:38\
is the joy of\
assisting the Savior\
11:41\
in His work of redemption.\
11:43\
As the seed and\
children of Abraham,\
11:46\
we participate in\
blessing all the families\
11:49\
of the earth "with the\
blessings of the Gospel, which\
11:52\
are the blessings of salvation,\
even of life eternal."\
11:59\
THE WORDS OF ALMA COME TO MIND:\
"This is my glory, that perhaps\
12:03\
I may be an instrument\
in the hands of God\
12:06\
to bring some soul to\
repentance; and this is my joy.\
12:11\
"And behold, when I see many\
of my brethren truly penitent,\
12:15\
and coming to the\
Lord their God,\
12:17\
then is my soul\
filled with joy. ...\
12:21\
"But I do not joy in\
my own success alone,\
12:24\
but my joy is more full because\
of the success of my brethren,\
12:28\
who have been up to\
the land of Nephi. ...\
12:32\
"Now, when I think of the\
success of these my brethren\
12:35\
my soul is carried away,\
even to the separation of it\
12:38\
from the body, as it\
were, so great is my joy."\
12:43\
The fruits of our service\
to one another in the Church\
12:46\
are part of the joy\
"set before us."\
12:50\
Even in times of\
discouragement or stress,\
12:53\
we can minister patiently\
if we are focused\
12:56\
on the joy of pleasing God\
and bringing light, relief,\
13:01\
and happiness to His children,\
our brothers and sisters.\
13:06\
When in Haiti last\
month for the dedication\
13:09\
of the Port-au-Prince temple,\
Elder David and Sister Susan\
13:12\
Bednar met with a young\
sister whose husband\
13:16\
had been killed a few days\
earlier in a tragic accident.\
13:20\
They wept together with her.\
13:23\
Yet on Sunday,\
this dear woman was\
13:27\
in her place as an usher\
at the dedication services\
13:30\
with a soft, welcoming smile\
for all who entered the temple.\
13:38\
I believe that the ultimate\
"joy of the saints"\
13:41\
comes in knowing that the\
Savior pleads their cause,\
13:46\
"and no one can conceive of the\
joy which [will fill] our souls\
13:50\
[as] we [hear Jesus] pray\
for us unto the Father."\
13:53\
With President\
Russell M. Nelson,\
13:56\
I testify that joy is a gift\
for faithful Saints "who\
14:00\
have endured the\
crosses of the world"\
14:02\
and who are\
"intentionally trying\
14:05\
to live a righteous life,\
as taught by Jesus Christ."\
14:09\
May your joy be full, I pray, in\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
