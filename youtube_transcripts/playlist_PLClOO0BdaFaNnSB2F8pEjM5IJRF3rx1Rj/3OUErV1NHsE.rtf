My dear brothers and sisters,\
as October general conference\
0:06\
approached last year, I\
prepared my conference talk\
0:11\
to highlight the\
100th anniversary\
0:14\
of the vision of\
the spirit world\
0:17\
given to President Joseph\
F. Smith on October 3, 1918.\
0:22\
A few days after I had submitted\
my talk for translation,\
0:28\
my beloved eternal\
companion, Barbara,\
0:32\
completed her mortal\
probation and passed\
0:35\
into the world of the spirit.\
0:39\
As the days have turned into\
weeks, and then months, and now\
0:43\
a year since\
Barbara's passing, I\
0:46\
find myself more fully\
appreciative of the scripture:\
0:51\
"Thou shalt live\
together in love,\
0:54\
insomuch that thou shalt weep\
for the loss of them that die."\
0:59\
Barbara and I were blessed to\
live together for 67 years.\
1:04\
But I have learned\
in a very real way\
1:06\
what it means to "weep for\
the loss" of those we love.\
1:12\
Oh, how I love and miss her!\
1:15\
I suppose most of us fail to\
fully appreciate what others\
1:19\
do for us until they are gone.\
1:22\
I knew Barbara was always\
busy, but I did not fully\
1:26\
understand the constant family,\
Church, and community demands\
1:31\
upon her time.\
1:32\
There were daily\
consecrated efforts\
1:35\
repeated thousands of times\
through the years that\
1:38\
kept our family functioning.\
1:42\
And through it all,\
no one in our family\
1:46\
ever heard her raise her\
voice or say an unkind word.\
1:51\
Floods of memories have\
washed over me this past year.\
1:54\
I have thought about the\
physically demanding choice\
1:58\
she made to be the\
mother to seven children.\
2:02\
Being a homemaker was the\
only career she ever wanted,\
2:06\
and she was in every aspect\
the consummate professional.\
2:12\
Often I have\
wondered how she kept\
2:14\
track of our children and me.\
2:17\
Meal preparation alone\
was a truly daunting task,\
2:23\
not to mention\
activities such as doing\
2:27\
the mountains of laundry our\
family generated every week,\
2:32\
keeping shoes and appropriately\
sized clothing on the children.\
2:37\
We all turned to her on\
a myriad of other issues\
2:42\
that were important to us.\
2:44\
And because they\
were important to us,\
2:47\
they were also important to her.\
2:50\
She was, in a word,\
magnificent--as a wife,\
2:55\
as a mother, as a\
friend, as a neighbor,\
2:59\
and as a daughter of God.\
3:02\
Now that she has moved\
on, I am happy that I\
3:05\
chose to sit next to her when\
I came home from the office\
3:10\
during the last few\
months of her life.\
3:14\
as we watched the endings\
of some of her favorite\
3:18\
musicals--over and over again\
because Alzheimer's would not\
3:24\
allow her to remember that\
she had seen them just\
3:27\
the afternoon before.\
3:29\
Memories of those special\
hand-holding sessions\
3:33\
are now very precious to me.\
3:37\
Brothers and sisters,\
please do not\
3:40\
miss an opportunity to look into\
the eyes of your family members\
3:45\
with love.\
3:46\
Children and parents,\
reach out to each other\
3:49\
and express your love\
and appreciation.\
3:53\
Like me, some of you\
may wake up one day\
3:57\
and discover that the time for\
such important communication\
4:01\
has passed.\
4:02\
Live each day\
together with hearts\
4:05\
filled with the gratitude,\
good memories, service,\
4:09\
and much love.\
4:12\
During this past\
year I have pondered\
4:14\
more intently than ever before\
about our Heavenly Father's\
4:20\
plan.\
4:21\
In teaching his\
son Corianton, Alma\
4:24\
referred to it as "the\
great plan of happiness."\
4:29\
The word that keeps\
coming to my mind\
4:31\
now when I consider\
the plan is reunion.\
4:36\
It is a plan designed by our\
loving Father in Heaven that\
4:41\
has at its center the grand\
and glorious possibilities\
4:46\
of family reunion--of eternally\
reuniting husbands and wives,\
4:53\
parents and children,\
generation upon generation\
4:58\
in the household of God.\
5:02\
That thought brings me\
comfort, the assurance\
5:05\
that I will be\
with Barbara again.\
5:08\
Although she physically suffered\
toward the end of her life,\
5:13\
her spirit was strong,\
noble, and pure.\
5:18\
She had prepared\
herself in all things\
5:21\
so that when the\
day comes, she can\
5:24\
stand before "the pleasing bar\
of God," full of confidence\
5:29\
and peaceful assurance.\
5:31\
But here I am, in two\
days 91 years old,\
5:37\
and I'm still\
wondering, "Am I ready?\
5:41\
Am I doing everything\
I need to do to be\
5:44\
able to hold her hand again?"\
5:47\
The most simple, basic\
certainty of life is this:\
5:52\
We are all going to die.\
5:54\
Whether we die old or\
young, easy or hard,\
5:59\
wealthy or indigent, beloved or\
lonely, nobody escapes death.\
6:07\
A few years ago, President\
Gordon B. Hinckley\
6:09\
said something that\
is particularly\
6:12\
meaningful about this: "How\
sweet is the assurance, how\
6:18\
comforting is the peace that\
[comes] from the knowledge\
6:22\
that if we marry\
right and live right,\
6:26\
our relationship will continue,\
notwithstanding the certainty\
6:31\
of death and the\
passage of time."\
6:36\
I certainly married right.\
6:38\
Of that there can be no doubt.\
6:40\
But that isn't enough,\
according to President Hinckley.\
6:44\
I also have to live right.\
6:48\
Today, "living right" can be\
a pretty confusing concept,\
6:52\
especially if you spend much\
time on social media, where\
6:56\
any voice can declare real\
truths or false concepts\
7:01\
about God and His\
plan for His children.\
7:05\
Thankfully, members\
of the Church\
7:08\
have eternally true\
gospel principles\
7:12\
to know how to live so that we\
might be better prepared when\
7:17\
we must die.\
7:19\
Just a few months\
before I was born,\
7:22\
my Apostle grandfather,\
Elder Melvin J. Ballard,\
7:26\
gave a talk that,\
for some people,\
7:29\
captured the essence of\
what it means to live right.\
7:33\
The talk was titled "The\
Struggle for the Soul."\
7:38\
His talk focused on\
the ongoing battle\
7:42\
between our physical body\
and our eternal spirits.\
7:48\
He said, "The greatest conflict\
that any man or woman will ever\
7:53\
have ... will be the battle\
that is had with self,"\
7:58\
explaining that Satan,\
"the enemy of our souls,"\
8:02\
attacks us through "the\
lusts, the appetites,\
8:07\
the ambitions of the flesh."\
8:09\
So the primary battle\
is "between our divine\
8:12\
and spiritual nature and\
the carnal natural man."\
8:20\
Brothers and\
sisters, remember, we\
8:23\
can receive spiritual\
help through the influence\
8:26\
of the Holy Ghost that can\
"teach you all things."\
8:30\
Help can also come through\
the power and blessings\
8:33\
of the priesthood.\
8:36\
Now I ask all of\
us for a moment,\
8:39\
how is this battle going\
with each one of you?\
8:43\
PRESIDENT DAVID O. MCKAY\
SAID: "Man's earthly existence\
8:48\
is but a test as to\
whether he will concentrate\
8:52\
his efforts, his mind, his\
soul, upon [the] things which\
8:57\
contribute to the\
comfort and gratification\
9:01\
of his physical\
nature, or whether he\
9:04\
will make as his life's\
purpose the acquisition\
9:09\
of spiritual qualities."\
9:13\
This battle between our carnal\
and our spiritual natures\
9:17\
isn't a new thing.\
9:19\
In his final sermon\
to his people,\
9:22\
King Benjamin taught that "the\
natural man is an enemy to God,\
9:29\
and has been from\
the fall of Adam,\
9:32\
and will be, forever and\
ever, unless he yields\
9:37\
to the enticings\
of the Holy Spirit,\
9:40\
and putteth off the natural\
man and becometh a saint\
9:44\
through the atonement\
of Christ the Lord."\
9:49\
The Apostle Paul taught that\
"they that are after the flesh\
9:55\
do mind the things of\
the flesh; but they\
9:59\
that are after the Spirit\
the things of the Spirit.\
10:03\
"For to be carnally\
minded is death;\
10:06\
but to be spiritually\
minded is life and peace."\
10:13\
It seems clear to me that one\
of the most important things we\
10:17\
can learn in this life\
is how to emphasize\
10:21\
our eternal spiritual nature\
and control our evil desires.\
10:29\
This should not\
be that difficult.\
10:31\
After all, our spirit has\
been around a lot longer\
10:34\
than our physical body.\
10:36\
Before this earth was formed,\
we lived in the spirit world\
10:41\
as sons and daughters of\
Heavenly Parents, who loved\
10:45\
us and continue to love us now.\
10:48\
And yes, we did have to\
make life-changing decisions\
10:52\
and choices in that\
premortal realm.\
10:55\
Every person who has\
ever lived or ever will\
10:59\
live on this planet made\
an essential decision\
11:02\
to choose to accept\
Heavenly Father's\
11:05\
plan for our salvation.\
11:08\
So we all came to earth\
with a proven track\
11:12\
record of a successful spiritual\
nature and eternal destiny.\
11:20\
Think about that for a moment.\
11:22\
This is who you and I really are\
and who you have always been:\
11:29\
a son or a daughter of\
God, with spiritual roots\
11:34\
in eternity and a\
future overflowing\
11:38\
with infinite possibilities.\
11:41\
You are--first and foremost\
and always--a spiritual being.\
11:47\
And so when one chooses to\
put our carnal nature ahead\
11:51\
of our spiritual\
nature, we are choosing\
11:54\
something that is contrary\
to our real, true, authentic\
12:00\
spiritual selves.\
12:02\
Still, there's no question\
that flesh and earthly impulses\
12:07\
complicate the decision making.\
12:09\
With a veil of\
forgetfulness drawn\
12:13\
between the premortal spirit\
world and this mortal world,\
12:17\
we can lose sight\
of our relationship\
12:20\
to God and our spiritual\
nature, and our carnal nature\
12:24\
can give priority to\
what we want right now.\
12:29\
Learning to choose the things\
of the Spirit over the things\
12:34\
of the flesh is one\
of the primary reasons\
12:37\
why this earthly experience is\
part of Heavenly Father's plan.\
12:42\
It's also why the plan is built\
upon the solid, sure foundation\
12:49\
of the Atonement of the Lord\
and Savior Jesus Christ,\
12:54\
so that our sins, including the\
errors we make when we yield\
12:59\
to the flesh, can be overcome\
through constant repentance\
13:04\
and we can live\
spiritually focused.\
13:07\
Now is the time to control\
our bodily appetites\
13:11\
to comply with the spiritual\
doctrine of Christ.\
13:17\
That is why we must\
not procrastinate\
13:20\
the day of our repentance.\
13:23\
Repentance, therefore, becomes\
an indispensable weapon\
13:27\
in our battle over self.\
13:29\
Just last general conference,\
President Russell M. Nelson\
13:32\
referred to this\
battle and reminded us\
13:36\
that "when we choose to\
repent, we choose to change!\
13:41\
We allow the Savior\
to transform us\
13:44\
into the best\
version of ourselves.\
13:46\
We choose to grow spiritually\
and receive joy--the joy\
13:51\
of redemption in Him.\
13:53\
When we choose to repent,\
we choose to become more\
13:57\
like Jesus Christ!"\
14:01\
Every night as I\
review my day in prayer\
14:04\
with my Father in Heaven,\
I ask to be forgiven\
14:08\
if I did anything\
wrong and promise\
14:11\
to try to be better tomorrow.\
14:13\
I believe this regular\
daily repentance\
14:16\
helps my spirit remind my\
body who is in charge of me.\
14:23\
Another resource is\
the weekly opportunity\
14:26\
we all have to refresh ourselves\
spiritually by partaking\
14:31\
of the sacrament in\
remembrance of the Atonement\
14:34\
and the perfect love that our\
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,\
14:39\
has for us.\
14:41\
Brothers and sisters, I\
encourage you to slow down\
14:45\
a bit and think about where\
you are now in subjugating\
14:51\
your carnal nature and\
empowering your divine,\
14:56\
spiritual nature so\
when the time comes,\
14:59\
you may pass into the spirit\
world to a joyful reunion with\
15:05\
your loved ones--for\
this for all of us,\
15:09\
I humbly pray in the sacred name\
of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
