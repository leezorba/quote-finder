One of our beloved\
hymns expresses the plea\
0:04\
"Thru cloud and sunshine,\
Lord, abide with me!"\
0:08\
I was once on a plane as it\
approached a large storm.\
0:12\
Looking out the window, I could\
see a dense blanket of clouds\
0:16\
below us.\
0:18\
The rays of the setting sun\
reflected off the clouds,\
0:21\
causing them to shine\
with intense brightness.\
0:24\
Soon the plane descended\
through the heavy clouds,\
0:29\
and we were suddenly enveloped\
in a thick darkness that\
0:33\
completely blinded us to the\
intense light we had witnessed\
0:38\
just moments earlier.\
0:41\
Black clouds may also\
form in our lives, which\
0:44\
can blind us to\
God's light and even\
0:47\
cause us to question if that\
light exists for us anymore.\
0:52\
Some of those clouds are\
of depression, anxiety,\
0:56\
and other forms of mental\
and emotional affliction.\
1:00\
They can distort the way we\
perceive ourselves, others,\
1:04\
and even God.\
1:06\
They affect women\
and men of all ages\
1:10\
in all corners of the world.\
1:13\
Likewise damaging is\
the desensitizing cloud\
1:17\
of skepticism that can\
affect others who have not\
1:21\
experienced these challenges.\
1:23\
Like any part of\
the body, the brain\
1:26\
is subject to illnesses,\
trauma, and chemical imbalances.\
1:31\
When our minds are\
suffering, it is\
1:33\
appropriate to seek help from\
God, from those around us,\
1:38\
and from medical and mental\
health professionals.\
1:42\
"All human beings--male\
and female--are created\
1:46\
in the image of God.\
1:48\
Each is a beloved spirit son or\
daughter of heavenly parents,\
1:53\
and ... each has a divine\
nature and destiny."\
1:57\
Like our Heavenly\
Parents and our Savior,\
2:00\
we have a physical body\
and experience emotions.\
2:06\
My dear sisters, it is normal\
to feel sad or worried once\
2:10\
in a while.\
2:11\
Sadness and anxiety are\
natural human emotions.\
2:16\
However, if we\
are constantly sad\
2:19\
and if our pain\
blocks our ability\
2:21\
to feel the love of our\
Heavenly Father and His Son\
2:26\
and the influence\
of the Holy Ghost,\
2:29\
then we may be suffering\
from depression, anxiety,\
2:34\
or another emotional condition.\
2:39\
MY DAUGHTER ONCE WROTE:\
"There was a time ...\
2:42\
[when] I was extremely\
sad all of the time.\
2:45\
I always thought that sadness\
was something to be ashamed of,\
2:50\
and that it was a\
sign of weakness.\
2:52\
So I kept my sadness to myself.\
2:55\
...\
2:55\
I felt completely worthless."\
3:01\
A FRIEND DESCRIBED IT THIS\
WAY: "Since my early childhood,\
3:05\
I have faced a constant battle\
with feelings of hopelessness,\
3:09\
darkness, loneliness, and\
fear and the sense that I\
3:14\
am broken or defective.\
3:17\
I did everything to hide\
my pain and to never give\
3:21\
the impression that I\
was anything but thriving\
3:24\
and strong."\
3:26\
My dear friends, it can happen\
to any of us--especially when,\
3:31\
as believers in the\
plan of happiness,\
3:34\
we place unnecessary burdens on\
ourselves by thinking we need\
3:39\
to be perfect now.\
3:41\
Such thoughts can\
be overwhelming.\
3:44\
Achieving perfection is a\
process that will take place\
3:49\
throughout our mortal life\
and beyond--and only through\
3:54\
the grace of Jesus Christ.\
3:58\
In contrast, when we open up\
about our emotional challenges,\
4:03\
admitting we are not\
perfect, we give others\
4:06\
permission to share\
their struggles.\
4:09\
Together we realize\
there is hope\
4:12\
and we do not have\
to suffer alone.\
4:15\
As disciples of Jesus Christ,\
we have made a covenant with God\
4:20\
that we "are willing to\
bear one another's burdens"\
4:24\
and "to mourn with\
those that mourn."\
4:27\
This may include\
becoming informed\
4:29\
about emotional illnesses,\
finding resources\
4:33\
that can help address\
these struggles,\
4:37\
and ultimately bringing\
ourselves and others to Christ,\
4:42\
who is the Master Healer.\
4:44\
Even if we do not know how to\
relate to what others are going\
4:49\
through, validating\
that their pain is real\
4:52\
can be an important first\
step in finding understanding\
4:57\
and healing.\
4:59\
In some cases, the cause\
of depression or anxiety\
5:02\
can be identified,\
while other times it\
5:06\
may be harder to discern.\
5:08\
Our brains may suffer because\
of stress or staggering fatigue,\
5:13\
which can sometimes be improved\
through adjustments in diet,\
5:17\
sleep, and exercise.\
5:19\
Other times, therapy\
or medication\
5:22\
under the direction of\
trained professionals\
5:25\
may also be needed.\
5:28\
Untreated mental or\
emotional illness\
5:30\
can lead to increased\
isolation, misunderstandings,\
5:35\
broken relationships,\
self-harm, and even suicide.\
5:41\
I know this firsthand,\
as my own father\
5:46\
died of suicide many years ago.\
5:50\
His death was shocking\
and heartbreaking\
5:54\
for my family and me.\
5:56\
It has taken me years to\
work through my grief,\
6:00\
and it was only\
recently that I learned\
6:04\
talking about suicide\
in appropriate ways\
6:07\
actually helps to prevent\
it rather than encourage it.\
6:11\
I have now openly discussed my\
father's death with my children\
6:15\
and witnessed the healing\
that the Savior can\
6:19\
give on both sides of the veil.\
6:23\
Sadly, many who suffer from\
severe depression distance\
6:27\
themselves from\
their fellow Saints\
6:30\
because they feel they do\
not fit some imaginary mold.\
6:34\
We can help them know and\
feel that they do indeed\
6:38\
belong with us.\
6:40\
It is important to recognize\
that depression is not\
6:44\
the result of weakness, nor is\
it usually the result of sin.\
6:49\
It "thrives in secrecy\
but shrinks in empathy."\
6:55\
Together, we can break through\
the clouds of isolation\
6:59\
and stigma so the burden\
of shame is lifted\
7:02\
and miracles of\
healing can occur.\
7:06\
During His mortal\
ministry, Jesus Christ\
7:09\
healed the sick\
and the afflicted,\
7:11\
but each person had to\
exercise faith in Him\
7:15\
and act to receive His healing.\
7:18\
Some walked for long distances,\
others extended their hand\
7:23\
to touch His garment, and\
others had to be carried to Him\
7:28\
in order to be healed.\
7:30\
When it comes to healing, don't\
we all need Him desperately?\
7:36\
"Are we not all beggars?"\
7:40\
Let us follow the Savior's path\
and increase our compassion,\
7:44\
diminish our tendency\
to judge, and stop\
7:47\
being the inspectors of\
the spirituality of others.\
7:52\
Listening with love\
is one of the greatest\
7:54\
gifts we can offer, and we may\
be able to help carry or lift\
7:59\
the heavy clouds that suffocate\
our loved ones and friends so\
8:03\
that, through our love, they can\
once again feel the Holy Ghost\
8:08\
and perceive the light that\
emanates from Jesus Christ.\
8:15\
If you are constantly surrounded\
by a "mist of darkness,"\
8:18\
turn to Heavenly Father.\
8:21\
Nothing that you\
have experienced\
8:23\
can change the eternal\
truth that you are His child\
8:28\
and that He loves you.\
8:31\
Remember that Christ is\
your Savior and Redeemer,\
8:35\
and God is your Father.\
8:37\
They understand.\
8:40\
Picture Them close by you,\
listening and offering support.\
8:44\
"[They] will console you\
in your afflictions."\
8:48\
Do all you can and trust in\
the Lord's atoning grace.\
8:53\
Your struggles do not define\
you, but they can refine you.\
8:58\
Because of a "thorn\
in the flesh,"\
9:01\
you may have the ability to feel\
more compassion toward others.\
9:06\
As guided by the Holy\
Ghost, share your story\
9:10\
in order to "succor\
the weak, lift up\
9:13\
the hands which hang down, and\
strengthen the feeble knees."\
9:18\
For those of us currently\
struggling or supporting\
9:21\
someone who is\
struggling, let us\
9:24\
be willing to follow\
God's commandments\
9:26\
so we may always have\
His Spirit with us.\
9:30\
Let us do the "small and simple\
things" that will give us\
9:34\
spiritual strength.\
9:35\
As President Russell\
M. Nelson said,\
9:39\
"Nothing opens the heavens\
quite like the combination\
9:43\
of increased purity,\
exact obedience,\
9:47\
earnest seeking, daily\
feasting on the words of Christ\
9:51\
in the Book of Mormon,\
and regular time\
9:54\
committed to temple and\
family history work."\
9:58\
Let us all remember that\
our Savior, Jesus Christ,\
10:02\
"[has taken] upon him\
[our] infirmities,\
10:05\
that his bowels may\
be filled with mercy,\
10:08\
according to the flesh,\
that he may know ...\
10:11\
how to succor [us] according\
to [our] infirmities."\
10:15\
He came "to bind up\
the brokenhearted, ...\
10:19\
to comfort all that mourn;\
... to give unto them beauty\
10:22\
for ashes, the oil\
of joy for mourning,\
10:26\
the garment of praise for\
the spirit of heaviness."\
10:29\
I testify to you that\
"thru cloud and sunshine"\
10:34\
the Lord will abide with us,\
our "afflictions [can be]\
10:37\
swallowed up in\
the joy of Christ,"\
10:40\
and "it is by grace that we are\
saved, after all we can do."\
10:44\
I testify that Jesus Christ\
will return to the earth\
10:48\
"with healing in his wings."\
10:51\
Ultimately, He "shall wipe\
away all tears from [our] eyes;\
10:56\
and there shall be\
no more ... sorrow."\
10:58\
For all who will\
"come unto Christ,\
11:01\
and be perfected in him," the\
"sun shall no more go down; ...\
11:06\
for the Lord shall be\
[our] everlasting light,\
11:10\
and the days of [our]\
mourning shall be ended."\
11:13\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
