One of my favorite Primary\
songs begins with these words:\
0:07\
"I belong to The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
0:12\
I know who I am.\
0:13\
I know God's plan.\
0:15\
I'll follow him in faith.\
0:17\
I believe in the\
Savior, Jesus Christ."\
0:21\
What a simple and beautiful\
statement of the truths\
0:24\
we believe!\
0:26\
As members of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
0:29\
Saints, we know who we are.\
0:31\
We know that "God is the\
Father of our spirits.\
0:35\
We are ...\
0:36\
His children, and He loves us.\
0:39\
We lived [with Him in heaven]\
before we [came to] earth."\
0:43\
We know God's plan.\
0:45\
We were there with Him\
as He presented it.\
0:48\
Our Father in Heaven's "whole\
purpose--His work and His\
0:55\
glory--is to enable each of\
us to enjoy all His blessings.\
1:01\
He ... provided a perfect plan\
to accomplish His purpose.\
1:06\
We understood and accepted\
this plan ... of happiness, ...\
1:10\
[plan of] redemption\
and ... salvation"\
1:12\
before we came to earth.\
1:15\
"Jesus Christ is\
central to God's plan.\
1:18\
Through His Atonement,\
Jesus Christ\
1:21\
fulfilled His Father's\
purpose and made\
1:24\
it possible for\
each of us to enjoy\
1:27\
immortality and exaltation.\
1:30\
Satan, or the devil, is\
an enemy to God's plan"\
1:34\
and has been from the beginning.\
1:38\
"Agency, or the\
ability to choose,\
1:40\
is one of God's greatest\
gifts to His children.\
1:44\
...\
1:44\
We must choose whether to follow\
Jesus Christ or follow Satan."\
1:50\
These are simple truths\
we can share with others.\
1:54\
Let me tell you of a time\
when my mother shared\
1:57\
such a simple truth\
by simply being\
2:00\
open to having a conversation\
and recognizing an opportunity.\
2:05\
Many years ago, my mother\
was returning to Argentina\
2:08\
for a visit with my brother.\
2:10\
And my mom never\
liked, really, flying,\
2:14\
so she asked one of my sons to\
give her a blessing of comfort\
2:18\
and protection.\
2:19\
He felt prompted to\
also bless his grandma\
2:22\
with special guidance and\
direction from the Holy Ghost\
2:27\
to strengthen and touch\
the hearts of many\
2:31\
who were desirous to\
learn of the gospel.\
2:35\
At the Salt Lake airport,\
my mother and brother\
2:38\
met a seven-year-old girl\
who was returning home\
2:42\
from a skiing trip\
with her family.\
2:45\
Her parents noticed\
how long she had\
2:48\
been talking to\
my mom and brother\
2:50\
and decided to join them.\
2:52\
They introduced themselves\
and their daughter as Eduardo,\
2:57\
Maria Susana, and Giada Pol.\
3:00\
There was a natural\
and warm connection\
3:03\
to this sweet family.\
3:05\
Both families were excited\
to be traveling together\
3:09\
on the same flight to\
Buenos Aires, Argentina.\
3:13\
As their conversation\
continued, my mother\
3:16\
noted that until\
that moment, they'd\
3:18\
never heard about the restored\
Church of Jesus Christ.\
3:24\
One of the first\
questions Susana asked\
3:26\
was "Would you tell me\
about that beautiful museum\
3:29\
with that golden statue on top?"\
3:34\
My mom explained that the\
beautiful edifice was not\
3:37\
a museum but a\
temple of the Lord\
3:39\
where we make covenants\
with God so we can return\
3:43\
to live with Him one day.\
3:46\
Susana confessed to my mom that\
before their trip to Salt Lake,\
3:50\
she had prayed for something\
to strengthen her spirit.\
3:55\
During the flight, my mom bore\
her simple but strong testimony\
3:58\
of the gospel and invited\
Susana to find the missionaries\
4:02\
in her hometown.\
4:03\
Susana asked my mom,\
"How will I find them?"\
4:07\
My mom replied, "You\
can't miss them;\
4:10\
they are either two young\
men dressed in white shirts\
4:13\
and ties or two nicely\
dressed young women,\
4:16\
and they always wear a tag\
showing their name and also\
4:20\
'The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.'"\
4:24\
The families exchanged\
phone numbers\
4:26\
and said goodbye at the\
Buenos Aires airport.\
4:29\
Susana, who since then\
has become my good friend,\
4:33\
told me many times that\
she felt so sad to leave\
4:37\
my mom at the airport.\
4:39\
She said, "Your mom glowed.\
4:42\
I can't explain it, but she\
had a brightness about her\
4:46\
that I didn't want\
to leave behind."\
4:49\
As soon as Susana got\
back to her hometown,\
4:52\
she and her\
daughter, Giada, went\
4:55\
to share this experience\
with Susana's mom, who\
4:58\
lived just a few blocks\
away from their home.\
5:01\
As they were driving,\
Susana happened\
5:03\
to see two young men walking\
down the street, dressed\
5:07\
as my mom described.\
5:09\
She stopped the car in\
the middle of the street,\
5:12\
got out, and asked\
these two young men,\
5:15\
"Are you by chance from the\
Church of Jesus Christ?"\
5:18\
They said, "Yes."\
5:19\
"Missionaries?"\
5:20\
she asked.\
5:21\
They both replied,\
"Yes, we are!"\
5:24\
She then said, "Get\
into my car; you're\
5:26\
coming home to teach me."\
5:30\
[LAUGHTER]\
5:32\
You've got to love her.\
5:35\
Two months later, Maria\
Susana was baptized.\
5:38\
Her daughter, Giada, was also\
baptized when she turned nine.\
5:42\
We are still working on Eduardo,\
whom we love no matter what.\
5:48\
Since then, Susana has\
become one of the greatest\
5:52\
missionaries I have ever met.\
5:54\
She is like the sons of Mosiah,\
bringing many souls to Christ.\
5:59\
In one of our\
conversations, I asked her,\
6:02\
"What is your secret?\
6:03\
How do you share the\
gospel with others?"\
6:06\
She told me, "It is very simple.\
6:08\
Every day before\
I leave my house,\
6:10\
I pray, asking Heavenly Father\
to direct me to someone who\
6:15\
needs the gospel in their life.\
6:17\
I sometimes take\
a Book of Mormon\
6:20\
to share with them or pass-along\
cards from the missionaries,\
6:25\
and when I start\
talking to someone,\
6:27\
I simply ask them if they\
have heard about the Church."\
6:32\
Susana also said,\
"Other times I just\
6:35\
smile while I am\
waiting for the train.\
6:38\
One day a man looked\
at me and said,\
6:42\
'What are you smiling about?'\
6:45\
He kind of caught me off guard.\
6:47\
"I replied, 'I'm smiling\
because I'm happy!'\
6:52\
"He then said, 'And what\
are you so happy about?'\
6:55\
"I answered, 'I am a\
member of The Church\
6:57\
of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints,\
6:59\
and that makes me happy.\
7:02\
Have you heard about it?'"\
7:04\
When he said no, she gave\
him a pass-along card\
7:07\
and invited him to attend\
the upcoming Sunday services.\
7:11\
The following Sunday, she\
greeted him at the door.\
7:16\
President Dallin H. Oaks taught:\
7:19\
"There are three\
things all members can\
7:22\
do to help share the gospel.\
7:24\
...\
7:25\
"First, we can all\
pray for desire\
7:28\
to help with this vital part\
of the work of salvation.\
7:32\
...\
7:32\
"Second, we can keep the\
commandments [ourselves].\
7:36\
...\
7:37\
Faithful members will always\
have the Savior's Spirit ...\
7:40\
with them to guide them as\
they seek to participate\
7:44\
in the great work of sharing\
the restored gospel of Jesus\
7:47\
Christ.\
7:49\
"Third, we can pray for\
inspiration on what we can do\
7:53\
... to share the\
gospel with others ...\
7:56\
[and] pray with a commitment\
to act upon the inspiration you\
8:02\
receive."\
8:03\
Brothers and sisters,\
children and youth,\
8:06\
can we be like my friend\
Susana and share the gospel\
8:09\
with others?\
8:11\
Can we invite a\
friend who is not\
8:13\
of our faith to come to\
church with us on Sunday?\
8:17\
Or can we perhaps share a\
copy of the Book of Mormon\
8:21\
with a relative or a friend?\
8:23\
Can we help others find their\
ancestors on FamilySearch\
8:28\
or share with others what we\
have learned during the week\
8:32\
as we have been studying\
Come, Follow Me?\
8:36\
Can we be more like our\
Savior, Jesus Christ, and share\
8:41\
with others what brings\
us joy to our lives?\
8:45\
The answer to all of\
these questions is yes!\
8:49\
We can do it!\
8:51\
In the scriptures we read that\
"members of The Church of Jesus\
8:56\
Christ are sent forth\
'to labor in his vineyard\
9:00\
for the salvation of\
the souls of men.'\
9:03\
This work of salvation includes\
member missionary work,\
9:08\
convert retention, activation\
of less-active members, temple\
9:13\
and family history work,\
and teaching the gospel."\
9:17\
My dear friends, the Lord\
needs us to gather Israel.\
9:21\
In the Doctrine and\
Covenants He has said,\
9:24\
"Neither take ye thought\
beforehand what ye shall say;\
9:29\
but treasure up in your minds\
continually the words of life,\
9:33\
and it shall be given\
you in the very hour\
9:36\
that portion that shall\
be meted unto every man."\
9:40\
In addition, He has promised us:\
9:44\
"And if it so be\
that you should labor\
9:46\
all your days in crying\
repentance unto this people,\
9:51\
and bring, save it\
be one soul unto me,\
9:54\
how great shall be\
your joy with him\
9:57\
in the kingdom of my Father!\
10:00\
"And now, if your joy will\
be great with one soul\
10:04\
that you have brought unto me\
[in] the kingdom of my Father,\
10:09\
how great will be your joy if\
you should bring many souls\
10:15\
unto me!"\
10:17\
The Primary song I\
began with concludes\
10:20\
with this profound statement:\
10:23\
"I believe in the\
Savior, Jesus Christ.\
10:26\
I'll honor his name.\
10:28\
I'll do what is right;\
10:29\
I'll follow his light.\
10:31\
His truth I will proclaim."\
10:34\
I bear witness that\
these words are true\
10:37\
and that we have a\
loving Father in Heaven,\
10:40\
who is waiting for us to turn\
to Him to bless our lives\
10:45\
and the lives of\
those around us.\
10:47\
May we have the desire\
to bring our brothers\
10:51\
and sisters to\
Christ is my prayer,\
10:54\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
