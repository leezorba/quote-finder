As parents excitedly await\
the birth of a child,\
0:04\
they have the\
responsibility of choosing\
0:06\
a name for their new baby.\
0:09\
Perhaps when you were\
born, you received\
0:11\
a name that was passed down in\
your family for generations.\
0:15\
Or maybe the name you were\
given was popular in the year\
0:19\
or area in which you were born.\
0:22\
The prophet Helaman and his wife\
gave meaningful family names\
0:27\
to their infant\
sons Nephi and Lehi.\
0:30\
Helaman told his sons:\
0:33\
"I have given unto you the\
names of our first parents ...\
0:36\
that when you remember your\
names ye may remember them;\
0:40\
and when ye remember them ye\
may remember their works ...\
0:44\
that it is said, and also\
written, that they were good.\
0:48\
"Therefore, my sons,\
I would that ye\
0:50\
should do that which is good."\
0:54\
Nephi's and Lehi's\
names helped them\
0:57\
remember the good works\
of their ancestors\
1:00\
and encouraged them\
to do good as well.\
1:04\
Sisters, no matter where we\
live, what language we speak,\
1:07\
or whether we are\
eight years old or 108,\
1:11\
we all share a special name\
that has these same purposes.\
1:17\
"For as many of [us] as have\
been baptized into Christ have\
1:21\
put on Christ ... for [we]\
are all one in Christ Jesus."\
1:27\
As members of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
1:30\
Saints, "we first pledge[d]\
our willingness to take upon us\
1:34\
the name of Christ ... by\
the ordinance of baptism."\
1:37\
Through this\
covenant, we promised\
1:39\
to always remember Him, keep His\
commandments, and serve others.\
1:44\
Our willingness to keep this\
covenant is renewed each\
1:48\
Sabbath day when we partake of\
the sacrament and rejoice once\
1:52\
again in the blessing of\
"walk[ing] in newness of life."\
1:57\
The name we were given\
at birth reflects\
2:00\
our individual identity\
and gives us belonging\
2:04\
within our earthly families.\
2:06\
However, when we were\
"born again" at baptism,\
2:10\
our understanding of\
who we are was enlarged.\
2:14\
"Because of the covenant which\
ye have made ye shall be called\
2:18\
the children of Christ,\
... for behold, ...\
2:21\
he hath spiritually\
begotten you;\
2:24\
for ye say that your hearts are\
changed through faith on his\
2:27\
name; therefore, ye\
are born of him."\
2:32\
Thus, with covenant\
identity and belonging,\
2:36\
we are called by the\
name of Jesus Christ.\
2:40\
And "there [is] no\
other name given\
2:42\
nor any other way nor means\
whereby salvation can come\
2:46\
unto the children of men,\
only in and through the name\
2:51\
of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent."\
2:54\
The name of Jesus was known\
long before His birth.\
2:59\
To King Benjamin,\
an angel prophesied,\
3:02\
"And he shall be called Jesus\
Christ, the Son of God, ...\
3:06\
and his mother shall\
be called Mary."\
3:09\
His work of "redeeming\
love" was also\
3:12\
made known to God's children\
whenever the gospel has\
3:15\
been on the earth, from\
the days of Adam and Eve\
3:19\
until our present\
day, so they could\
3:22\
"know to what\
source they may look\
3:24\
for a remission of their sins."\
3:28\
Last year, President\
Russell M. Nelson\
3:30\
extended "a prophetic\
plea" to the sisters\
3:34\
to "shape the future by helping\
to gather scattered Israel."\
3:38\
He invited us to read\
the Book of Mormon\
3:41\
and "mark each verse that speaks\
of or refers to the Savior."\
3:46\
He asked that we "be intentional\
about talking of Christ,\
3:50\
rejoicing in Christ,\
and preaching of Christ\
3:53\
with [our] family and friends."\
3:56\
Perhaps you have\
begun to recognize\
4:00\
the fruits of his promise\
that "you and they will\
4:03\
be drawn closer to the Savior.\
4:05\
...\
4:06\
And changes, even miracles,\
will begin to happen."\
4:11\
Our promise to always remember\
the Savior gives us strength\
4:15\
to stand for truth and\
righteousness--whether we are\
4:18\
in a large crowd or in\
our solitary places,\
4:22\
where no one knows our\
actions except for God.\
4:26\
When we remember\
Him and His name\
4:28\
we bear, we have no place for\
self-degrading comparisons\
4:33\
or overbearing judgments.\
4:35\
With our eyes on the Savior, we\
see ourselves for who we really\
4:41\
are--a cherished child of God.\
4:46\
Our covenant remembering\
quiets worldly\
4:50\
worries, turns\
self-doubt into courage,\
4:54\
and gives hope in\
times of trial.\
4:57\
And when we stumble and\
fall in our progression\
5:01\
along the covenant\
path, we have only\
5:04\
to remember His name and His\
loving-kindness towards us.\
5:08\
"For he has all [wisdom], all\
[power], and all understanding;\
5:14\
he comprehendeth all things,\
and he is a merciful Being ...\
5:19\
to those who will repent\
and believe on his name."\
5:23\
Surely there is no sweeter\
sound than the name\
5:28\
of Jesus to all those\
who, with a broken heart\
5:32\
and a contrite spirit, seek\
to "do better and be better."\
5:39\
PRESIDENT NELSON\
TAUGHT: "The day\
5:41\
is gone when you can be a quiet\
and comfortable Christian.\
5:45\
Your religion is not just\
about showing up for Church\
5:48\
on Sunday.\
5:49\
It is about showing up as a true\
disciple from Sunday morning\
5:53\
through Saturday night. ...\
5:55\
There is no such thing\
as a 'part-time' disciple\
5:59\
of the Lord Jesus Christ."\
6:02\
Our willingness to take\
upon us the name of Christ\
6:05\
is more than a formal\
exchange of words.\
6:09\
It is not a passive promise\
or a cultural contrivance.\
6:14\
It is not a rite of passage\
or a name tag that we wear.\
6:19\
It is not a saying that\
we simply place on a shelf\
6:22\
or hang on a wall.\
6:24\
His is a name that is "put\
on," written in our hearts,\
6:30\
and "engraven upon\
[our] countenances."\
6:33\
The Savior's atoning sacrifice\
should be remembered always\
6:37\
through our thoughts, actions,\
and interactions with others.\
6:43\
Not only does He\
remember our names,\
6:46\
but He remembers us always.\
6:49\
The Savior declared:\
6:52\
"For can a woman forget\
her sucking child,\
6:55\
that she should\
not have compassion\
6:57\
on the son of her womb?\
6:59\
Yea, they may forget, yet\
will I not forget thee,\
7:03\
O house of Israel.\
7:05\
"Behold, I have graven thee\
upon the palms of my hands."\
7:12\
President George\
Albert Smith taught,\
7:15\
"Honor the names that you bear,\
because some day you will have\
7:20\
the privilege and the\
obligation of reporting ...\
7:24\
to your Father in heaven ...\
what you have done with [those\
7:28\
names]."\
7:30\
Like the carefully chosen\
names of Nephi and Lehi,\
7:34\
can it be said and written of\
us that we are true disciples\
7:38\
of the Lord Jesus Christ?\
7:40\
Do we honor the\
name of Jesus Christ\
7:44\
that we have willingly\
taken upon ourselves?\
7:47\
Are we both "a\
minister and a witness"\
7:51\
of His loving-kindness\
and His redeeming power?\
7:57\
Not long ago, I was listening\
to the Book of Mormon.\
8:01\
In the last chapter\
of 2 Nephi, I\
8:04\
heard Nephi say something\
that I had never\
8:07\
read the same way before.\
8:10\
All throughout his record,\
he teaches and testifies\
8:14\
of the "Redeemer," the "Holy One\
of Israel," the "Lamb of God,"\
8:19\
and the "Messiah."\
8:21\
But as he closed his account,\
I heard him say these words:\
8:26\
"I glory in plainness; I glory\
in truth; I glory in my Jesus,\
8:35\
for he hath redeemed my soul."\
8:40\
When I heard these\
words, my heart rejoiced,\
8:43\
and I had to listen\
over and over again.\
8:46\
I recognized and\
responded to that verse\
8:50\
just like I recognize and\
respond to my own name.\
8:55\
The Lord has said, "Yea,\
blessed is this people who\
8:59\
are willing to bear my name;\
for in my name shall they\
9:04\
be called; and they are mine."\
9:10\
As members of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
9:12\
Saints, may we\
"gladly [take upon us]\
9:16\
the name of Christ" by honoring\
His name with love, devotion,\
9:22\
and good works.\
9:24\
I testify that He\
is "the Lamb of God,\
9:27\
yea, even the Son of\
the Eternal Father."\
9:30\
In the name of His Holy\
Child, Jesus Christ, amen.\
