Thank you, Sister\
Franco, Elder Gong.\
0:05\
Thank you, choir.\
0:06\
Thank you, President\
Nelson, First Presidency,\
0:10\
for already a wonderful general\
conference week and weekend.\
0:16\
A beloved children's fantasy\
novel written many years ago\
0:21\
begins with the sentence\
"In a hole in the ground\
0:24\
there lived a hobbit."\
0:27\
The story of Bilbo\
Baggins is about\
0:30\
a most normal and\
unremarkable hobbit\
0:34\
who is presented with a\
most remarkable opportunity:\
0:38\
the wonderful\
chance at adventure\
0:41\
and the promise\
of a great reward.\
0:45\
The problem is that most\
self-respecting hobbits want\
0:48\
nothing to do with adventures.\
0:50\
Their lives are\
all about comfort.\
0:53\
They enjoy eating\
six meals a day\
0:55\
when they can get them and spend\
their days in their gardens,\
0:59\
swapping tales with\
visitors, singing,\
1:02\
playing musical\
instruments, and basking\
1:05\
in the simple joys of life.\
1:08\
However, when Bilbo is\
presented with the prospect\
1:13\
of a grand adventure, something\
surges deep within his heart.\
1:20\
He understands from the\
outset that the journey\
1:23\
will be challenging.\
1:24\
Even dangerous.\
1:26\
There is even a possibility\
he might not return.\
1:30\
And yet, the call to\
adventure has reached deep\
1:35\
into his heart.\
1:36\
And so, this unremarkable\
hobbit leaves comfort behind\
1:42\
and enters the path\
to a great adventure\
1:46\
that will take him all the\
way to "there and back again."\
1:52\
Perhaps one of the reasons this\
story resonates with so many\
1:55\
is because it is our story too.\
2:00\
Long, long ago,\
even before we were\
2:02\
born, in an age dimmed by\
time and clouded from memory,\
2:08\
we too were invited to\
embark on an adventure.\
2:11\
It was proposed by God,\
our Heavenly Father.\
2:15\
Accepting this\
adventure would mean\
2:18\
leaving the comfort and security\
of His immediate presence.\
2:24\
It would mean coming to\
earth for a journey filled\
2:28\
with unknown danger and trial.\
2:31\
We knew it would not be easy.\
2:35\
But we also knew that we\
would gain precious treasures,\
2:39\
including a physical body and\
experiencing the intense joys\
2:44\
and sorrows of mortality.\
2:47\
We would learn to strive,\
to seek, and to struggle.\
2:50\
We would discover truths\
about God and ourselves.\
2:56\
Of course, we knew we would make\
many mistakes along the way.\
3:01\
But we also had a\
promise: that because\
3:05\
of the great sacrifice\
of Jesus Christ,\
3:09\
we could be cleansed\
of our transgressions,\
3:14\
refined and purified\
in our spirits,\
3:17\
and one day resurrected and\
reunited with those we love.\
3:24\
We learned how\
much God loves us.\
3:27\
He gave us life and He\
wants us to succeed.\
3:30\
Therefore, He prepared\
a Savior for us.\
3:35\
"Nevertheless," our\
Father in Heaven said,\
3:39\
"thou mayest choose for thyself,\
for it is given unto thee."\
3:46\
There must have been parts\
of the mortal adventure\
3:49\
that worried and even\
terrified God's children,\
3:52\
since a large number of our\
spiritual brothers and sisters\
3:57\
decided against it.\
4:01\
By the gift and power\
of moral agency,\
4:04\
we determined that\
the potential of what\
4:08\
we could learn and eternally\
become was well worth the risk.\
4:16\
And so, trusting the promise\
and power of God and His Beloved\
4:21\
Son, we accepted the challenge.\
4:26\
I did.\
4:28\
And so did you.\
4:30\
We agreed to leave the\
security of our first estate\
4:33\
and embark on our\
own great adventure\
4:36\
of "there and back again."\
4:41\
And yet, mortal life has a way\
of distracting us, doesn't it?\
4:46\
We tend to lose sight of our\
great quest, preferring comfort\
4:51\
and ease over\
growth and progress.\
4:55\
Still, there remains\
something undeniable\
4:59\
deep within our hearts\
that hungers for a higher\
5:05\
and nobler purpose.\
5:08\
This hunger is one reason why\
people are drawn to the gospel\
5:12\
and Church of Jesus Christ.\
5:16\
The restored gospel\
is, in a sense,\
5:20\
a renewal of the\
call to adventure\
5:23\
we accepted so long ago.\
5:26\
The Savior invites us, each\
day, to set aside our comforts\
5:32\
and securities and join Him on\
the journey of discipleship.\
5:39\
There are many\
bends in this road.\
5:41\
There are hills,\
valleys, and detours.\
5:45\
There may even be\
metaphorical spiders, trolls,\
5:49\
and even a dragon or two.\
5:53\
But if you stay on the\
path and trust in God,\
5:57\
you will eventually find the\
way to our glorious destiny\
6:01\
and back to our heavenly home.\
6:06\
So how do you begin?\
6:09\
It's quite simple.\
6:11\
First, you need to choose to\
incline your heart to God.\
6:15\
Strive each day to find Him.\
6:18\
Learn to love Him.\
6:20\
And then let that\
love inspire you\
6:24\
to learn, understand,\
and follow His teachings\
6:28\
and keep God's commandments.\
6:32\
The restored gospel\
of Jesus Christ\
6:35\
is given to us in a\
plain and simple way\
6:38\
that a child can understand.\
6:40\
Yet the gospel of Jesus\
Christ has the answers\
6:44\
to the most complex\
questions in life\
6:47\
and has such profound\
depth and complexity\
6:51\
that even with a\
lifetime of study\
6:54\
and pondering, we can scarcely\
comprehend even the smallest\
7:01\
part.\
7:03\
If you hesitate\
in this adventure\
7:04\
because you doubt your ability,\
remember that discipleship\
7:11\
is not about doing\
things perfectly;\
7:14\
it's about doing\
things intentionally.\
7:20\
It is your choices that\
show what you truly are,\
7:25\
far more than your abilities.\
7:29\
Even when you fail,\
you can choose\
7:33\
not to give up, but rather\
discover your courage,\
7:38\
press forward, and rise up.\
7:41\
That is the great\
test of the journey.\
7:46\
God knows that you\
are not perfect,\
7:49\
that you will fail at times.\
7:51\
God loves you no less when you\
struggle than when you triumph.\
7:58\
Like a loving parent, He merely\
wants you to keep intentionally\
8:02\
trying.\
8:03\
Discipleship is like\
learning to play the piano.\
8:07\
Perhaps all you can do at first\
is play a barely recognizable\
8:13\
rendition of "Chopsticks."\
8:16\
But if you continue\
practicing, the simple tunes\
8:20\
will one day give way to\
wondrous sonatas, rhapsodies,\
8:24\
and concertos.\
8:26\
Now, that day may not\
come during this life,\
8:30\
but it will come.\
8:35\
All God asks is that you\
consciously keep striving.\
8:42\
There is something interesting,\
almost paradoxical,\
8:47\
about this path you've\
chosen: the only way for you\
8:52\
to progress in your\
gospel adventure\
8:56\
is to help others\
progress as well.\
9:02\
To help others is the\
path of discipleship.\
9:08\
Faith, hope, love,\
compassion, and service\
9:15\
refine us as disciples.\
9:19\
Through your efforts to\
help the poor and the needy,\
9:23\
to reach out to\
those in distress,\
9:25\
your own character is\
purified and forged,\
9:30\
your spirit is enlarged, and\
you walk a little taller.\
9:36\
But this love cannot come with\
expectations of repayment.\
9:41\
It cannot be the kind of service\
that expects recognition,\
9:46\
adulation, or favor.\
9:49\
True disciples of Jesus Christ\
love God and His children\
9:54\
without expectation of\
something in return.\
9:59\
We love those who disappoint\
us, who don't like us.\
10:05\
Even those who ridicule,\
abuse, and seek to hurt us.\
10:12\
When you fill your hearts\
with the pure love of Christ,\
10:17\
you leave no room for rancor,\
judgment, and shaming.\
10:24\
You keep God's commandments\
because you love Him.\
10:29\
In the process, you slowly\
become more Christlike\
10:33\
in your thoughts and deeds.\
10:36\
And what adventure could\
be greater than this?\
10:41\
The third thing we strive\
to master in this journey\
10:44\
is to take upon ourselves\
the name of Jesus Christ\
10:49\
and not be ashamed of being a\
member of the Church of Jesus\
10:54\
Christ.\
10:55\
We do not hide our faith.\
10:58\
We do not bury it.\
11:00\
To the contrary, we\
talk about our journey\
11:03\
with others in normal\
and natural ways.\
11:07\
That's what friends do--they\
talk about things that are\
11:11\
important to them.\
11:12\
Things that are\
close to their heart\
11:14\
and make a difference to them.\
11:16\
That's what you do.\
11:18\
You tell your stories\
and experiences\
11:21\
as a member of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
11:24\
Saints.\
11:25\
Sometimes your stories\
make people laugh.\
11:28\
Sometimes they\
bring them to tears.\
11:31\
Sometimes they will help\
people to continue in\
11:36\
patience, resilience,\
and courage\
11:40\
to face another\
hour, another day\
11:44\
and come a little closer to God.\
11:48\
Share your experiences in\
person, on social media,\
11:51\
in groups, everywhere.\
11:55\
One of the last\
things Jesus told\
11:56\
His disciples was that they\
were to go throughout the world\
12:00\
and share the story\
of the risen Christ.\
12:05\
Today we too joyfully accept\
that great commission.\
12:11\
What a glorious message\
we have to share:\
12:14\
because of Jesus Christ,\
every man, woman, and child\
12:20\
can return home safely\
to their heavenly home\
12:23\
and there dwell in\
glory and righteousness!\
12:28\
There is even more\
good news to share.\
12:31\
God has appeared\
to man in our day!\
12:34\
We have a living prophet.\
12:38\
May I remind you\
that God does not\
12:40\
need you to "sell" the restored\
gospel or the Church of Jesus\
12:45\
Christ.\
12:47\
He simply expects you to\
not hide it under a bushel.\
12:52\
And if people decide the\
Church is not for them,\
12:54\
that is their decision.\
12:57\
It does not mean\
that you have failed.\
12:59\
You continue to\
treat them kindly.\
13:03\
Nor does it exclude that\
you invite them again.\
13:09\
The difference between\
casual social contacts\
13:12\
and compassionate, courageous\
discipleship is invitation!\
13:19\
We love and respect\
all of God's children,\
13:22\
regardless of their\
position in life,\
13:24\
regardless of their\
race or religion,\
13:26\
regardless of their\
life's decisions.\
13:31\
For our part, we will\
say, "Come and see!\
13:35\
Find out for\
yourself how walking\
13:38\
the path of discipleship will\
be rewarding and ennobling."\
13:42\
We invite people\
to "come and help,\
13:45\
as we try to make the\
world a better place."\
13:50\
And we say, "Come and stay!\
13:52\
We are your brothers\
and sisters.\
13:55\
We are not perfect.\
13:57\
We trust God and seek to\
keep His commandments.\
14:01\
"Join with us, and you\
will make us better.\
14:04\
And in the process, you\
will become better as well.\
14:09\
Let's take this\
adventure together."\
14:13\
When our friend Bilbo Baggins\
felt the call to adventure\
14:16\
stir within him, he decided\
to get a good night's rest,\
14:21\
enjoy a hearty\
breakfast, and start out\
14:24\
first thing in the morning.\
14:27\
When Bilbo awoke, he noticed\
his house was a mess,\
14:30\
and he was almost distracted\
from his noble plan.\
14:36\
But then his friend Gandalf came\
and asked, "Whenever are you\
14:41\
going to come?"\
14:42\
To catch up with\
his friends, Bilbo\
14:45\
had to decide for\
himself what to do.\
14:51\
And so, the very normal\
and unremarkable hobbit\
14:55\
found himself darting\
out his front door\
14:59\
to the path of\
adventure so quickly\
15:02\
that he forgot his hat, walking\
stick, and pocket handkerchief.\
15:08\
He even left his second\
breakfast unfinished.\
15:13\
Perhaps there is a lesson\
here for us as well.\
15:17\
If you and I have\
felt the stirrings\
15:20\
to join the great adventure\
of living and sharing\
15:23\
what our loving Heavenly Father\
has prepared for us a long time\
15:28\
ago, I assure you,\
today is the day\
15:33\
to follow God's Son and our\
Savior on His path of service\
15:38\
and discipleship.\
15:40\
We could spend a lifetime\
waiting for that moment when\
15:43\
everything lines up perfectly.\
15:45\
But now is the time\
to commit fully\
15:49\
to seeking God,\
ministering to others,\
15:53\
and sharing our\
experience with others.\
15:57\
Leave behind your hat,\
walking stick, handkerchief,\
16:00\
and messy house.\
16:01\
To those of us already\
walking that path,\
16:04\
take courage, compassion,\
have confidence, and continue!\
16:09\
To those who have left the\
path, please come back,\
16:14\
join again with us,\
make us stronger.\
16:18\
And to those who have\
not yet begun, why delay?\
16:22\
If you want to\
experience the wonders\
16:24\
of this great spiritual\
journey, set foot\
16:28\
upon your own grand adventure!\
16:30\
Speak with the missionaries.\
16:32\
Speak with your\
Latter-day Saint friends.\
16:34\
Speak with them about this\
marvelous work and a wonder.\
16:40\
It's time to begin!\
16:43\
If you sense that\
your life could\
16:45\
have more meaning, a higher\
purpose, stronger family\
16:50\
bonds, and a closer connection\
with God, please, come,\
16:55\
join with us.\
16:57\
If you seek a\
community of people\
16:59\
who are working to become the\
best versions of themselves,\
17:03\
help those in need, and make\
this world a better place,\
17:07\
come, join with us!\
17:10\
Come and see what this\
marvelous, wonderous,\
17:14\
and adventurous\
journey is all about.\
17:17\
Along the way you will\
discover yourself.\
17:21\
You will discover meaning.\
17:24\
You will discover God.\
17:27\
You will discover\
the most adventurous\
17:29\
and glorious journey\
of your life.\
17:32\
Of this I testify in the name\
of our Redeemer and Savior,\
17:37\
in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
