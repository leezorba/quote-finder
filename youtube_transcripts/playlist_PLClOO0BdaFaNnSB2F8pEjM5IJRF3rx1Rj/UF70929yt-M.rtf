When I was a child, a\
member of the Church\
0:02\
offered to help my family fly\
from Puerto Rico to Salt Lake\
0:07\
so we could be\
sealed in the temple,\
0:09\
but soon obstacles\
began to appear.\
0:13\
One of my sisters,\
Marivid, became ill.\
0:17\
Unsettled, my parents prayed\
about what to do and still felt\
0:22\
prompted to make the journey.\
0:24\
They trusted that as they\
followed the promptings\
0:27\
of the Lord, our family would\
be watched over and blessed--and\
0:32\
we were.\
0:33\
No matter the obstacles\
we face in life,\
0:36\
we can trust that Jesus Christ\
will prepare a way forward\
0:41\
as we walk with faith.\
0:42\
God has promised that all who\
live according to the covenants\
0:47\
they have made with\
Him will, in His time,\
0:51\
receive all His\
promised blessings.\
0:53\
Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught,\
"Some blessings come soon, ...\
0:57\
come late, and some\
don't come until heaven;\
1:01\
but for those who embrace\
the gospel of Jesus Christ,\
1:05\
they come."\
1:06\
Moroni taught that "faith\
is things which are hoped\
1:09\
for and not seen; wherefore,\
dispute not because ye see not,\
1:15\
for ye receive no witness until\
... the trial of your faith."\
1:20\
Our question is "What\
should we do to best meet\
1:24\
the trials that come our way?"\
1:26\
In the first public remarks\
as President of the Church,\
1:30\
President Russell M. Nelson\
taught: "As a new Presidency,\
1:35\
we want to begin\
with the end in mind.\
1:37\
For this reason, we're speaking\
to you today from a temple.\
1:42\
The end for which each of us\
strives is to be endowed with\
1:47\
power in [the] house of the\
Lord, sealed as families,\
1:51\
faithful to covenants made in\
[the] temple that qualify us\
1:55\
for the greatest gift of\
God--that of eternal life.\
1:59\
The ordinances of the temple\
and the covenants you make there\
2:04\
are key to strengthening your\
life, your marriage and family,\
2:08\
and your ability to resist the\
attack ... of the adversary.\
2:12\
Your worship in the\
temple and your service\
2:15\
there [for you\
and] your ancestors\
2:18\
will bless you with increased\
personal revelation and peace\
2:22\
and will fortify your commitment\
to stay on the covenant path."\
2:29\
As we follow God's voice\
and His covenant path,\
2:32\
He will strengthen\
us in our trials.\
2:35\
My family's trip to the temple\
years ago was difficult,\
2:39\
but as we approached the\
temple in Salt Lake City, Utah,\
2:42\
my mother, full\
of joy and faith,\
2:45\
said, "We are going to be OK;\
the Lord will protect us."\
2:50\
We were sealed as a family,\
my sister recovered,\
2:54\
and all this happened only after\
the trial of my parents' faith\
2:59\
and following the\
promptings of the Lord.\
3:03\
This example of my parents still\
influences our lives today.\
3:07\
Their example taught us the\
"why" of the gospel doctrine\
3:12\
and helped us understand the\
meaning, purpose, and blessings\
3:16\
that the gospel brings.\
3:17\
Understanding the "why" of\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
3:21\
can also help us face\
our trials with faith.\
3:25\
Ultimately, everything God\
invites and commands us to do\
3:29\
is the expression\
of His love for us\
3:32\
and His desire to give\
us the blessings reserved\
3:36\
for the faithful.\
3:37\
We cannot assume that our\
children will learn to love\
3:41\
the gospel on their own; it\
is our responsibility to teach\
3:45\
them.\
3:46\
As we help our children learn\
how to use their agency wisely,\
3:50\
our example can inspire them to\
make their own right choices.\
3:55\
Their faithful\
living will in turn\
3:58\
help their children\
to know the truth\
4:00\
of the gospel for themselves.\
4:03\
Young men and young women,\
hear the prophet today talking\
4:07\
to you, seek to\
learn divine truths,\
4:10\
and seek to understand\
the gospel for yourselves.\
4:14\
President Nelson\
recently counseled:\
4:17\
"What wisdom do you lack? ...\
4:19\
Follow the example of\
the Prophet Joseph.\
4:22\
Find a quiet place.\
4:23\
...\
4:23\
Humble yourself before God.\
4:25\
Pour out your heart to\
your Heavenly Father.\
4:28\
Turn to Him for answers."\
4:30\
As you seek guidance from\
your loving Heavenly Father,\
4:34\
listening to the counsel\
of living prophets,\
4:37\
and watching the example\
of righteous parents,\
4:40\
you too can become a strong\
link of faith in your family.\
4:47\
To parents with children\
who have left the covenant\
4:50\
path, gently go back, help them\
comprehend the gospel's truths.\
4:56\
Start now; it is never too late.\
4:59\
Our example of righteous living\
can make a great difference.\
5:04\
President Nelson taught:\
"As Latter-day Saints,\
5:08\
we have become\
accustomed to think ...\
5:11\
of 'church' as something that\
happens in our meetinghouses,\
5:16\
supported by what\
happens at home.\
5:19\
We need an adjustment\
to this pattern.\
5:22\
It is time for a home-centered\
Church, supported\
5:26\
by what takes place inside\
our branch, ward, and stake\
5:30\
buildings."\
5:32\
A story is told of a woman\
who was upset that her son was\
5:36\
eating too much candy.\
5:37\
No matter how much\
she told him to stop,\
5:40\
he continued to satisfy\
his sweet tooth.\
5:43\
Totally frustrated, she\
decided to take her son\
5:46\
to see a wise man\
whom he respected.\
5:49\
She approached him\
and said, "Sir, my son\
5:52\
eats too much candy.\
5:54\
Would you please tell\
him to stop eating it?"\
5:57\
He listened carefully, then\
said to her son, "Go home\
6:05\
and come back in two weeks."\
6:07\
She took her son and\
went home, perplexed\
6:10\
why he had not asked the boy\
to stop eating so much candy.\
6:14\
Two weeks later they returned.\
6:16\
The wise man looked\
directly to the boy\
6:19\
and said, "Boy, you should\
stop eating so much candy.\
6:24\
It is not good for your health."\
6:27\
The boy nodded and\
promised he would.\
6:29\
The boy's mother\
asked, "Why didn't you\
6:32\
tell him that two weeks ago?"\
6:34\
The wise man smiled.\
6:36\
"Two weeks ago I was still\
eating too much candy myself."\
6:43\
This man lived\
with such integrity\
6:45\
that he knew his advice\
would carry power only if he\
6:51\
was following his own counsel.\
6:53\
The influence we\
have on our children\
6:55\
is more powerful as they\
see us walking faithfully\
6:59\
on the covenant path.\
7:01\
The Book of Mormon prophet\
Jacob is an example\
7:04\
of such righteousness.\
7:06\
His son Enos wrote of the impact\
of his father's teachings:\
7:10\
"I, Enos, knowing my father\
that he was a just man--for he\
7:15\
taught me in his language,\
and also in the nurture\
7:18\
and admonition of the Lord--and\
blessed be the name of my God\
7:23\
for it-- ...\
7:23\
"...\
7:24\
And the words which I had often\
heard my father speak[ing]\
7:28\
concerning eternal life,\
and the joy of the saints,\
7:32\
sunk deep into my heart."\
7:35\
The mothers of the stripling\
warriors lived the gospel,\
7:38\
and their children were\
filled with conviction.\
7:41\
Their leader reported:\
7:43\
"They had been taught\
by their mothers,\
7:45\
that if they did not doubt,\
God [will] deliver them.\
7:49\
"And they rehearsed unto me\
the words of their mothers,\
7:52\
saying: We do not doubt\
our mothers knew it."\
7:56\
Enos and the stripling\
warriors were strengthened\
7:59\
by the faith of\
their parents, which\
8:01\
helped them meet their\
own trials of faith.\
8:04\
We are blessed with\
the restored gospel\
8:07\
of Jesus Christ in our\
days, which lifts us when we\
8:11\
feel discouraged or troubled.\
8:13\
We are reassured that our\
efforts will bear fruit\
8:16\
in the Lord's own due\
time if we press forward\
8:20\
through the trials of our faith.\
8:22\
My wife and I, with\
the Area Presidency,\
8:24\
recently accompanied\
Elder David A. Bednar\
8:27\
to the dedication of the\
Haiti Port-au-Prince Temple.\
8:30\
Our son Jorge, who came with\
us, said about his experience:\
8:34\
"Amazing, Papa!\
8:36\
As soon as Elder Bednar started\
with the dedicatory prayer, ...\
8:40\
I could feel the room fill\
with warmth and light.\
8:43\
The prayer added so\
much to my understanding\
8:46\
of the purpose of [the] temple.\
8:48\
It [is] really ... the\
house of the Lord."\
8:51\
In the Book of\
Mormon, Nephi teaches\
8:53\
that as we desire to\
know the will of God,\
8:57\
He will strengthen us.\
8:58\
He wrote, "I, Nephi, being\
exceedingly young ...\
9:02\
and also having great desires\
to know of the mysteries of God,\
9:07\
wherefore, I did\
cry unto the Lord;\
9:10\
and behold he did visit me, and\
[I] did soften my heart that I\
9:14\
did believe all the words which\
had been spoken by my father;\
9:19\
wherefore, I did not rebel\
against him like unto\
9:23\
my brothers."\
9:24\
Brothers and sisters, let\
us help our children and all\
9:28\
around us to follow\
God's covenant path so\
9:31\
that the Spirit might\
teach them to soften\
9:34\
their hearts to desire to\
follow Him through their life.\
9:38\
As I consider the\
example of my parents,\
9:41\
I realize that our\
faith will show us\
9:45\
the way back to\
our heavenly home.\
9:47\
I know miracles come after\
the trial of our faith.\
9:51\
I bear testimony of Jesus Christ\
and His atoning sacrifice.\
9:56\
I know He is our\
Savior and Deliverer.\
10:00\
He and our Heavenly\
Father came that morning\
10:04\
of the spring of 1820\
to young Joseph Smith,\
10:07\
the prophet of the Restoration.\
10:09\
President Russell M. Nelson\
is the prophet of our day.\
10:13\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
