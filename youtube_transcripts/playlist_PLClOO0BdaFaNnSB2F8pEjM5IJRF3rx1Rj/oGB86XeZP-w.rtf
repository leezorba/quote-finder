I know what you are thinking!\
0:02\
Just one more\
speaker and we will\
0:05\
hear from President Nelson.\
0:08\
[LAUGHTER]\
0:10\
Hoping to keep you\
alert for a few minutes\
0:13\
as we await our\
beloved prophet, I\
0:16\
have selected a very appealing\
topic: my subject is fruit.\
0:24\
With the color, texture, and\
sweetness of berries, bananas,\
0:29\
watermelons, and mangoes,\
or of more exotic fruit\
0:33\
like kiwano or\
pomegranate, fruit has long\
0:37\
been a treasured delicacy.\
0:40\
During His earthly ministry,\
the Savior compared good fruit\
0:44\
to things of eternal worth.\
0:46\
He said, "Ye shall know\
them by their fruits."\
0:50\
"Every good tree bringeth\
forth good fruit."\
0:53\
He encouraged us to gather\
"fruit unto life eternal."\
0:58\
In a vivid dream\
that we all know well\
1:01\
in the Book of Mormon,\
the prophet Lehi\
1:03\
finds himself in "a dark\
and dreary wilderness."\
1:07\
There is filthy water, a mist\
of darkness, strange roads\
1:12\
and forbidden paths,\
as well as a rod\
1:16\
of iron along a straight\
and narrow path leading\
1:19\
to a beautiful tree with\
"fruit [that makes] one happy."\
1:23\
Recounting the dream, Lehi says,\
"I did partake of the fruit;\
1:28\
... it was most sweet, above all\
that I [had] ever ... tasted.\
1:32\
...\
1:32\
[And] it filled my soul\
with exceedingly great joy."\
1:36\
This fruit was "[more] desirable\
[than any] other fruit."\
1:42\
What does this tree with its\
most precious fruit symbolize?\
1:46\
It represents "the love\
of God" and proclaims\
1:50\
our Heavenly Father's\
marvelous plan of redemption.\
1:53\
"For God so loved the world,\
that he gave his only begotten\
1:58\
Son, that whosoever believeth in\
him should not perish, but have\
2:03\
everlasting life."\
2:05\
This precious fruit symbolizes\
the wondrous blessings\
2:09\
of the Savior's\
incomparable Atonement.\
2:12\
Not only will we live again\
following our mortality,\
2:16\
but through our faith\
in Jesus Christ,\
2:19\
our repentance and\
keeping the commandments,\
2:23\
we can be forgiven of\
our sins and one day\
2:27\
stand clean and pure before\
our Father and His Son.\
2:33\
Partaking of the fruit of the\
tree also symbolizes that we\
2:36\
embrace the ordinances and\
covenants of the restored\
2:39\
gospel--being baptized,\
receiving the gift of the Holy\
2:43\
Ghost, and entering the house\
of the Lord to be endowed with\
2:47\
power from on high.\
2:49\
Through the grace\
of Jesus Christ\
2:52\
and by honoring\
our covenants, we\
2:55\
receive the immeasurable\
promise of living\
2:58\
with our righteous family\
throughout eternity.\
3:02\
No wonder the angel described\
the fruit as "the most joyous\
3:07\
to the soul."\
3:08\
It truly is!\
3:11\
As we have all learned,\
even after savoring\
3:14\
the precious fruit of\
the restored gospel,\
3:17\
staying true and faithful\
to the Lord Jesus Christ\
3:20\
is still not easily done.\
3:23\
As has been said many\
times in this conference,\
3:26\
we continue to face distractions\
and deceptions, confusion\
3:31\
and commotion, enticements\
and temptations that\
3:37\
attempt to pull our hearts\
away from the Savior\
3:40\
and the joys and\
beauties we have\
3:41\
experienced in following Him.\
3:45\
Because of this\
adversity, Lehi's dream\
3:48\
also includes a warning!\
3:50\
On the other side of the\
river is a spacious building\
3:54\
with people of all ages\
pointing their fingers,\
3:57\
mocking and scoffing\
at the righteous\
4:00\
followers of Jesus Christ.\
4:03\
The people in the building\
are ridiculing and laughing\
4:05\
at those keeping\
the commandments,\
4:07\
hoping to discredit and deride\
their faith in Jesus Christ\
4:12\
and in His gospel.\
4:14\
And because of the verbal\
attacks of doubt and disdain\
4:18\
launched at the\
believers, some of those\
4:21\
who have tasted\
of the fruit begin\
4:24\
to feel ashamed of the\
gospel they once embraced.\
4:28\
The false allures of\
the world seduce them;\
4:31\
they turn away from the\
tree and from the fruit\
4:35\
and, in the Lord's words,\
"[fall] away into forbidden\
4:39\
paths and [are] lost."\
4:43\
In our world today, the\
adversary's construction crews\
4:47\
are working overtime,\
hastily inflating\
4:50\
the large and spacious building.\
4:52\
The expansion has spread\
across the river, hoping\
4:55\
to envelope our homes, while\
the pointers and the scoffers\
4:59\
wail day and night on\
their internet megaphones.\
5:03\
President Nelson\
explained, "The adversary\
5:07\
is quadrupling his efforts to\
disrupt testimonies and impede\
5:10\
the work of the Lord."\
5:12\
Let us remember Lehi's\
words: "We heeded them not."\
5:19\
Although we need not fear,\
we are to be on guard.\
5:23\
At times little things can\
upend our spiritual balance.\
5:28\
Please don't allow\
your questions,\
5:31\
the insults of others,\
faithless friends,\
5:35\
or unfortunate mistakes\
and disappointments\
5:38\
to turn you away\
from the sweet, pure,\
5:42\
and soul-satisfying\
blessings that\
5:44\
come from the precious\
fruit of the tree.\
5:48\
Keep your eyes and your hearts\
centered on the Savior Jesus\
5:53\
Christ and the eternal joy\
that comes only through Him.\
5:59\
In June, my wife,\
Kathy, and I attended\
6:01\
the funeral of Jason Hall.\
6:04\
At the time of his passing, he\
was 48 years old and serving\
6:09\
as an elders quorum president.\
6:12\
Here are Jason's words about\
an event that changed his life:\
6:17\
"[At age 15] I [was]\
in a diving accident.\
6:20\
...\
6:21\
I [broke] my neck and was\
paralyzed from the chest down.\
6:25\
I lost complete\
control of my legs\
6:28\
and partial control of my arms.\
6:30\
I could no longer walk,\
stand, ... or feed myself.\
6:35\
I could barely\
breathe or speak."\
6:39\
"'Dear Father [in\
Heaven],' I begged,\
6:41\
'if I could only have my\
hands, I know I could make it.\
6:44\
Please, Father, please ...\
6:46\
"... 'Keep my legs, Father;\
I just [pray for] the use\
6:50\
of my hands.'"\
6:54\
Jason never received\
the use of his hands.\
6:59\
Can you hear the voices\
from the spacious building?\
7:02\
"Jason Hall, God does\
not hear your prayers!\
7:06\
If God is a loving God, how\
could He leave you like this?\
7:10\
Why have faith in Christ?"\
7:14\
Jason Hall heard their voices,\
but he did not heed them.\
7:19\
Instead, he feasted upon\
the fruit of the tree.\
7:22\
His faith in Jesus\
Christ became immovable.\
7:27\
He graduated from the university\
and married Kolette Coleman\
7:30\
in the temple, describing\
her as the love of his life.\
7:35\
After 16 years of\
marriage, another miracle,\
7:39\
their precious son,\
Coleman, was born.\
7:43\
How did they grow their faith?\
7:45\
Kolette explained: "We\
trusted in God's plan.\
7:49\
And it gave us hope.\
7:51\
We knew that Jason would [in\
a future day] be whole. ...\
7:54\
We knew that God provided\
us a Savior, whose atoning\
7:59\
sacrifice enables us\
to keep looking forward\
8:02\
when we want to give up."\
8:05\
Speaking at Jason's\
funeral, 10-year-old Coleman\
8:10\
said his dad taught him\
"Heavenly Father [has] a plan\
8:14\
for us, earth life\
would be awesome,\
8:17\
and we could live in families.\
8:19\
...\
8:19\
But ... we would have to go\
through hard things and we\
8:22\
would make mistakes."\
8:25\
COLEMAN CONTINUED: "Heavenly\
Father sent His Son,\
8:29\
Jesus to earth.\
8:31\
His job was to be perfect.\
8:33\
To heal people.\
8:34\
To love them.\
8:35\
And then to suffer for all of\
our pain, sorrows, and sins.\
8:40\
Then He died for us."\
8:42\
Then Coleman added,\
"Because He did this,\
8:46\
Jesus knows how I\
feel right now."\
8:52\
HE CONTINUED: "Three days\
after Jesus died, He ...\
8:55\
came alive again,\
with His body perfect.\
8:58\
This is important to me\
because I know that ...\
9:01\
my [dad's] body will be\
perfect and we will be together\
9:04\
as a family."\
9:06\
COLEMAN CONCLUDED: "Every\
night since I was a baby,\
9:11\
my dad said to me, 'Dad loves\
you, Heavenly Father loves you,\
9:17\
and you're a good boy.'"\
9:22\
President Russell M. Nelson\
described why the Hall family\
9:25\
feels joy and hope.\
9:27\
He said:\
9:29\
"The joy we feel\
has little to do\
9:31\
with the circumstances of\
our lives and everything\
9:35\
to do with the\
focus of our lives.\
9:38\
"When the focus of our lives is\
on God's plan of salvation ...\
9:43\
and Jesus Christ and His gospel,\
we can feel joy regardless\
9:48\
of what is happening--or\
not happening--in our lives.\
9:52\
Joy comes from and\
because of Him.\
9:55\
He is the source of all joy. ...\
9:58\
"If we look to the world ...,\
we will never know joy. ...\
10:01\
[Joy] is the gift that\
comes from intentionally\
10:04\
trying to live a righteous life,\
as taught by Jesus Christ."\
10:11\
If you have been without\
the fruit of the tree\
10:13\
for some time, please know that\
the Savior's arms are always\
10:18\
outstretched to you.\
10:20\
He lovingly beckons,\
"Repent and come unto me."\
10:24\
His fruit is plentiful\
and always in season.\
10:28\
It cannot be\
purchased with money,\
10:30\
and no one who honestly\
desires it is denied.\
10:35\
if you desire to\
return to the tree\
10:37\
and taste the fruit\
once again, begin\
10:40\
by praying to your\
Heavenly Father.\
10:42\
Believe in Jesus Christ and the\
power of His atoning sacrifice.\
10:48\
I promise you that as\
you look to the Savior\
10:52\
"in every thought,"\
the fruit of the tree\
10:54\
will be yours once again,\
delicious to your taste,\
10:59\
joyous to your\
soul, "the greatest\
11:02\
of all the gifts of God."\
11:06\
Three weeks ago today, I saw\
the joy of the Savior's fruit\
11:09\
on full display as Kathy and\
I attended the Lisbon Portugal\
11:14\
Temple dedication.\
11:15\
The truths of the\
restored gospel\
11:18\
opened to Portugal in\
1975 as religious freedom\
11:22\
became available.\
11:24\
Many noble Saints who\
first tasted the fruit\
11:28\
when there were no\
congregations, no chapels,\
11:32\
and no temple closer\
than 1,000 miles\
11:35\
rejoiced with us that the\
precious fruit of the tree\
11:40\
is now in a house of the\
Lord in Lisbon, Portugal.\
11:44\
How I honor and revere\
these Latter-day\
11:47\
Saints who have kept their\
hearts riveted on the Savior.\
11:52\
The Savior said, "He\
that abideth in me,\
11:56\
and I in him, the same\
bringeth forth much\
12:00\
fruit: for without me\
ye can do nothing."\
12:07\
Speaking this morning\
to the members\
12:08\
of the Church across the\
world, President Nelson said,\
12:12\
"My dear brothers\
and sisters, you\
12:15\
are living exemplars of the\
fruits that come from following\
12:20\
the teachings of Jesus Christ."\
12:22\
Then he added, "I thank you!\
12:25\
I love you!"\
12:28\
We love you, President Nelson.\
12:32\
I am an eyewitness to\
the power of revelation\
12:35\
that rests upon\
our dear President.\
12:37\
He is the prophet of God.\
12:39\
Like Lehi of old,\
President Russell M. Nelson\
12:44\
beckons to us and all of God's\
family to come and partake\
12:48\
of the fruit of the tree.\
12:49\
May we have the humility and\
strength to follow his counsel.\
12:55\
I humbly witness that Jesus\
Christ is the Son of God.\
12:58\
His love, His\
power, and His grace\
13:03\
bring all things\
of lasting worth.\
13:06\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
