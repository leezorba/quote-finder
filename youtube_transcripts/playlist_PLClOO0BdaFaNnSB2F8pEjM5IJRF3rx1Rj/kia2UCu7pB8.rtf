Dear brothers and\
sisters, a Primary child\
0:04\
is learning to pray.\
0:05\
"Thank you for the letter A,\
the letter B, ... the letter G."\
0:12\
The child's prayer\
continues, "Thank you\
0:15\
for the letters X, Y,\
Z. Dear Heavenly Father,\
0:20\
thank you for the\
number 1, the number 2."\
0:23\
The Primary teacher\
worries but wisely waits.\
0:28\
The child says, "Thank\
you for the number 5,\
0:32\
the number 6--and thank\
you for my Primary teacher.\
0:37\
She's the only person who's\
ever let me finish my prayer."\
0:45\
Heavenly Father does hear\
every child's prayer.\
0:49\
With infinite love,\
He beckons us to come\
0:53\
believe and belong by covenant.\
0:57\
This world is full of a mirage,\
illusion, sleight of hand.\
1:02\
So much seems transitory\
and superficial.\
1:07\
When we put aside the masks,\
pretense, crowdsourced likes\
1:12\
and dislikes, we yearn for\
more than fleeting veneer,\
1:16\
ephemeral connection,\
or the pursuit\
1:19\
of worldly self-interest.\
1:21\
Gratefully, there is a way\
through to answers that matter.\
1:27\
When we come to God's great\
commandments to love Him\
1:30\
and those around\
us by covenant, we\
1:33\
do so not as stranger or guest\
but as His child at home.\
1:39\
The age-old paradox\
is still true.\
1:41\
In losing our worldly self\
through covenant belonging,\
1:45\
we find and become our best\
eternal self--free, alive,\
1:52\
real--and define our most\
important relationships.\
1:57\
Covenant belonging is to\
make and keep solemn promises\
2:00\
to God and each other, through\
sacred ordinances, that\
2:05\
invite the power of godliness\
to be manifest in our lives.\
2:09\
When we covenant all we are,\
we can become more than we are.\
2:15\
Covenant belonging gives us\
place, narrative, capacity\
2:19\
to become.\
2:20\
It produces faith unto\
life and salvation.\
2:26\
Divine covenants become a\
source of love for and from God\
2:30\
and thereby for and\
with each other.\
2:32\
God, our Heavenly\
Father, loves us more\
2:35\
and knows us better than\
we love or know ourselves.\
2:39\
Faith in Jesus Christ and\
personal change (repentance)\
2:44\
bring mercy, grace, forgiveness.\
2:47\
These comfort the\
hurt, loneliness,\
2:50\
injustice we experience\
in mortality.\
2:54\
Being God, our Heavenly\
Father wants us to receive\
2:58\
God's greatest gift--His\
joy, His eternal life.\
3:04\
Our God is a God of covenant.\
3:06\
By His nature, He "keepest\
covenant and showeth mercy."\
3:11\
His covenants endure "so\
long as time [should] last,\
3:14\
or the earth shall\
stand, or there\
3:16\
[should] be one man upon the\
face thereof to be saved."\
3:20\
We are not meant to wander\
in existential uncertainty\
3:23\
and doubt but to rejoice in\
cherished covenant relations\
3:28\
"stronger than the\
cords of death."\
3:31\
God's ordinances\
and covenants are\
3:33\
universal in their\
requirement and individual\
3:36\
in their opportunity.\
3:38\
In God's fairness,\
each individual\
3:41\
in every place and age can\
receive saving ordinances.\
3:45\
Agency applies--individuals\
choose whether to accept\
3:49\
offered ordinances.\
3:51\
God's ordinances\
provide guideposts\
3:54\
on His path of covenants.\
3:56\
We call God's plan\
to bring His children\
3:59\
home the plan of redemption,\
plan of salvation,\
4:02\
plan of happiness.\
4:04\
Redemption, salvation,\
celestial happiness\
4:08\
are possible because\
Jesus Christ "wrought out\
4:12\
this perfect atonement."\
4:15\
To belong with God and to walk\
with each other on His covenant\
4:18\
path is to be blessed\
by covenant belonging.\
4:23\
First, covenant belonging\
centers in Jesus Christ\
4:27\
as "mediator of\
the new covenant."\
4:30\
All things can work together\
for our good when we are\
4:33\
"sanctified in Christ ... in\
the covenant of the Father."\
4:37\
Every good and promised\
blessing comes to those\
4:40\
who remain faithful to the end.\
4:42\
The "happy state of those [who]\
keep the commandments of God"\
4:46\
is to be "blessed in all things,\
... temporal and spiritual,"\
4:50\
and to "dwell with God ...\
in never-ending happiness."\
4:55\
As we honor our covenants,\
we may sometimes\
4:58\
feel we are in the\
company of angels.\
5:00\
And we will be--those we love\
and who bless us on this side\
5:05\
of the veil and those who love\
and bless us from the other\
5:09\
side of the veil.\
5:10\
Recently Sister Gong\
and I saw covenant\
5:13\
belonging at its tender\
best in a hospital room.\
5:17\
A young father desperately\
needed a kidney transplant.\
5:21\
His family had wept,\
fasted, and prayed for him\
5:24\
to receive a kidney.\
5:26\
When news came a\
lifesaving kidney had just\
5:29\
become available, his\
wife quietly said,\
5:33\
"I hope the other family is OK."\
5:37\
To belong by covenant\
is, in the words\
5:40\
of the Apostle Paul, "that\
I may be comforted together\
5:44\
with you by the mutual\
faith both of you and me."\
5:50\
Along life's path, we\
may lose faith in God,\
5:53\
but He never loses faith in us.\
5:56\
As it were, His porch\
light is always on.\
6:01\
He invites us to come or\
return to the covenants that\
6:04\
mark His path.\
6:05\
He waits ready to\
embrace us, even when\
6:08\
we are "yet a great way off."\
6:11\
When we look with\
an eye of faith\
6:13\
for the patterns,\
arc, or connected dots\
6:16\
of our experience, we can\
see His tender mercies\
6:21\
and encouragement, especially\
in our trials, sorrows,\
6:25\
and challenges, as\
well as in our joys.\
6:28\
However often we\
stumble or fall,\
6:31\
if we keep moving toward Him, He\
will help us, a step at a time.\
6:38\
Second, the Book of\
Mormon is evidence\
6:41\
we can hold in our hand\
of covenant belonging.\
6:44\
The Book of Mormon is\
the promised instrument\
6:46\
for the gathering\
of God's children,\
6:48\
prophesied as a new covenant.\
6:51\
As we read the Book of Mormon,\
by ourselves and with others,\
6:55\
whether silently or\
aloud, we can ask God\
6:58\
"with a sincere heart,\
with real intent,\
7:01\
having faith in\
Christ," and receive,\
7:03\
by the power of the Holy\
Ghost, God's assurance\
7:07\
the Book of Mormon is true.\
7:09\
This includes assurance\
Jesus Christ is our Savior,\
7:13\
Joseph Smith is the\
prophet of the Restoration,\
7:17\
and the Lord's Church is\
called by His name--The Church\
7:21\
of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints.\
7:25\
The Book of Mormon speaks by\
ancient and modern covenant\
7:28\
to you who are the\
children of Lehi,\
7:31\
"children of the prophets."\
7:32\
Your forefathers\
received covenant promise\
7:35\
that you, their descendants,\
would recognize a voice\
7:39\
as if from the dust\
in the Book of Mormon.\
7:42\
That voice you feel\
as you read testifies\
7:46\
you are "children\
of the covenant"\
7:48\
and Jesus is your Good Shepherd.\
7:53\
The Book of Mormon invites\
each of us, in Alma's words,\
7:56\
to enter "into a\
covenant with [the Lord],\
7:59\
that [we] will serve him\
and keep his command ... ,\
8:02\
that he may pour out his spirit\
more abundantly upon [us]."\
8:06\
When we want to change for the\
better--as one person put it,\
8:11\
"to stop being miserable and to\
be happy being happy"--we can\
8:16\
become open to direction,\
help, and strength.\
8:18\
We can come by covenant to\
belong with God and a community\
8:23\
of faithful believers and\
receive the blessings promised\
8:27\
in the doctrine of Christ--now.\
8:31\
Restored priesthood\
authority and power\
8:34\
to bless all His children\
is a third dimension\
8:38\
of covenant belonging.\
8:39\
In this dispensation, John\
the Baptist and the Apostles\
8:43\
Peter, James, and John have\
come as glorified messengers\
8:47\
from God to restore His\
priesthood authority.\
8:51\
God's priesthood\
and His ordinances\
8:54\
sweeten relationships on\
earth and can seal covenant\
8:59\
relationships in heaven.\
9:01\
Priesthood can bless literally\
from cradle to grave--from\
9:05\
an infant's name and blessing\
to a grave dedication.\
9:09\
Priesthood blessings\
heal, comfort, counsel.\
9:13\
A father was angry with his\
son until forgiving love\
9:17\
came as the father gave his son\
a tender priesthood blessing.\
9:22\
The only member in her\
family, a dear young woman\
9:26\
was uncertain about\
God's love for her\
9:28\
until she received an\
inspired priesthood blessing.\
9:32\
Across the world,\
noble patriarchs\
9:36\
prepare spiritually to\
give patriarchal blessings.\
9:39\
As the patriarch lays\
his hands on your head,\
9:43\
he feels and expresses\
God's love for you.\
9:47\
He pronounces your lineage\
in the house of Israel.\
9:50\
He indicates blessings\
from the Lord.\
9:53\
Typically thoughtful,\
one patriarch's wife\
9:56\
told me how she and her family\
invite the Spirit, especially\
10:00\
on days their papa is giving\
patriarchal blessings.\
10:06\
Finally, the blessings\
of covenant belonging\
10:09\
come when we follow the\
Lord's prophet and rejoice\
10:13\
in temple covenant living,\
including in marriage.\
10:17\
Covenant marriage becomes\
supernal and eternal\
10:21\
as we daily choose the happiness\
of our spouse and family\
10:25\
before our own.\
10:26\
As me becomes we,\
we grow together.\
10:32\
We grow old together;\
we grow young together.\
10:37\
As we bless each other across\
a lifetime of forgetting\
10:40\
ourselves, we find our\
hopes and joys sanctified\
10:45\
in time and eternity.\
10:48\
While situations differ, when\
we do all we can, the best\
10:53\
we can, and sincerely ask and\
seek His help along the way,\
10:58\
the Lord will guide us,\
in His time and manner,\
11:02\
by the Holy Ghost.\
11:04\
Marriage covenants are binding\
by mutual choice of those\
11:08\
making them--a reminder of\
God's and our respect for agency\
11:13\
and the blessing of His help\
when we unitedly seek it.\
11:18\
The fruits of covenant belonging\
across family generations\
11:21\
are felt in our\
homes and hearts.\
11:24\
Please allow me to illustrate\
with personal examples.\
11:29\
When Sister Gong\
and I were falling\
11:31\
in love toward\
marriage, I learned\
11:33\
about agency and decisions.\
11:35\
For a period of time,\
we were studying\
11:39\
in two different countries\
in two different continents.\
11:44\
It is why I can honestly\
say I earned a PhD\
11:47\
in international relations.\
11:52\
When I asked, "Heavenly\
Father, should I marry Susan?"\
11:57\
I felt peace.\
11:58\
But it was when I learned\
to pray with real intent,\
12:02\
"Heavenly Father, I love\
Susan and want to marry her.\
12:06\
I promise I will be the best\
husband and father I can\
12:10\
be"--when I acted and\
made my best decisions,\
12:14\
it was then the strongest\
spiritual confirmations came.\
12:20\
Now our Gong and Lindsay\
FamilySearch family trees,\
12:24\
stories, and photos help\
us discover and connect\
12:28\
through the lived experience\
of generational covenant\
12:31\
belonging.\
12:32\
For us, respected\
progenitors include:\
12:37\
Great-Grandma Alice\
Blauer Bangerter,\
12:40\
who had three marriage\
proposals in one day,\
12:44\
later asked her husband to\
rig a foot pedal to her butter\
12:48\
churn so she could\
churn butter, knit,\
12:52\
and read at the same time.\
12:56\
Great-Grandpa Loy Kuei\
Char carried his children\
12:59\
on his back and his family's\
few belongings on a donkey\
13:03\
as they crossed the lava\
fields on Hawaii's Big Island.\
13:07\
Generations of Char family\
commitment and sacrifice\
13:12\
bless our family today.\
13:15\
Gram Mary Alice\
Powell Lindsay was\
13:19\
left with five young children\
when her husband and oldest\
13:23\
son both died suddenly\
just days apart.\
13:27\
A widow for 47 years,\
Gram raised her family\
13:32\
with sustaining love from\
local leaders and members.\
13:36\
During those many years,\
Gram promised the Lord\
13:40\
if He would help her,\
she would never complain.\
13:45\
The Lord helped her.\
13:47\
She never complained.\
13:51\
Brothers and sisters,\
witnessed by the Holy Ghost,\
13:54\
everything good and eternal is\
centered in the living reality\
13:58\
of God, our Eternal Father,\
and His Son, Jesus Christ,\
14:02\
and His Atonement.\
14:03\
Our Lord, Jesus Christ, is the\
mediator of the new covenant.\
14:08\
Testifying of Jesus Christ\
is a covenant purpose\
14:12\
of the Book of Mormon.\
14:14\
By oath and covenant, God's\
restored priesthood authority\
14:19\
is intended to bless\
all God's children,\
14:22\
including through covenant\
marriage, generational family,\
14:26\
and individual blessings.\
14:29\
Our Savior declares, "I am Alpha\
and Omega, Christ the Lord;\
14:36\
yea, even I am he, the\
beginning and the end,\
14:40\
the Redeemer of the world."\
14:43\
With us at the\
beginning, He is with us,\
14:46\
in all our covenant\
belonging, to the end.\
14:49\
I so testify in the\
sacred and holy name\
14:53\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
