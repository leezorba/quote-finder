My dear brothers\
and sisters, thank\
0:04\
you for all you\
are doing to help\
0:06\
gather Israel on both\
sides of the veil,\
0:09\
to strengthen your\
families, and to bless\
0:12\
the lives of those in need.\
0:14\
Thank you for living as true\
followers of Jesus Christ.\
0:19\
You know and love to obey\
His two great commandments,\
0:24\
to love God and to\
love your neighbors.\
0:29\
During the last six\
months, Sister Nelson and I\
0:32\
have met thousands\
of Saints as we\
0:35\
have traveled to Central\
and South America,\
0:38\
the islands of the Pacific, and\
various cities in the United\
0:42\
States.\
0:44\
As we travel, our hope\
is to build your faith.\
0:47\
Yet we always return having\
had our faith strengthened\
0:52\
by the members and\
friends we meet.\
0:54\
May I share three\
meaningful moments\
0:57\
from our recent experiences?\
1:01\
In May, Sister\
Nelson and I traveled\
1:03\
with Elder Gerrit W.\
and Sister Susan Gong\
1:06\
to the South Pacific.\
1:09\
While in Auckland, New Zealand,\
we had the honor of meeting\
1:12\
with imams from two\
mosques in Christchurch,\
1:16\
New Zealand, where just\
two months earlier,\
1:20\
innocent worshippers\
had been gunned down\
1:23\
in an act of horrible violence.\
1:28\
We extended our sympathy to\
these brothers of another faith\
1:32\
and reaffirmed our\
mutual commitment\
1:34\
to religious freedom.\
1:38\
We also offered volunteer labor\
and modest financial assistance\
1:42\
to rebuild their mosques.\
1:46\
Our meeting with\
these Muslim leaders\
1:48\
was filled with tender\
expressions of brotherhood.\
1:54\
In August, along\
with Elder Quentin L.\
1:57\
and Sister Mary Cook, Sister\
Nelson and I met individuals\
2:01\
in Buenos Aires, Argentina--most\
of them not of our faith--whose\
2:07\
lives have been changed by\
wheelchairs provided to them\
2:12\
through our Latter-day\
Saint Charities.\
2:16\
We were inspired as they\
expressed joy-filled gratitude\
2:21\
for their newfound mobility.\
2:26\
A third precious moment occurred\
just a few weeks ago here\
2:29\
in Salt Lake City.\
2:31\
It came from a unique letter\
I received on my birthday from\
2:37\
a young woman I will\
call Mary--age 14.\
2:42\
Mary wrote about things\
she and I had in common:\
2:56\
"You have 10 kids.\
2:58\
We have 10 kids.\
3:01\
You speak Mandarin.\
3:04\
Seven of the kids in my\
family, including me,\
3:10\
were adopted from China, so\
Mandarin is our first language.\
3:19\
You are a heart surgeon.\
3:21\
My sister has had two\
open-heart [operations].\
3:29\
You like two-hour church."\
3:35\
[LAUGHTER]\
3:37\
"We like two-hour church.\
3:46\
You have perfect pitch.\
3:49\
My brother has\
perfect pitch too.\
3:57\
He is blind like me."\
4:05\
Mary's words touched\
me deeply, revealing\
4:09\
not only her great spirit\
but also the consecration\
4:15\
of her mother and father.\
4:20\
Latter-day Saints, as with\
other followers of Jesus Christ,\
4:23\
are always looking for\
ways to help, to lift,\
4:27\
and to love others.\
4:30\
They who are willing to be\
called the Lord's people are\
4:33\
willing to "bear one\
another's burdens, ...\
4:36\
to mourn with those\
that mourn; ...\
4:38\
and [to] comfort those that\
stand in need of comfort."\
4:43\
They truly seek\
to live the first\
4:46\
and second great commandments.\
4:49\
When we love God\
with all our hearts,\
4:52\
He turns our hearts to\
the well-being of others\
4:55\
in a beautiful, virtuous cycle.\
5:02\
It would be impossible to\
calculate the amount of service\
5:04\
that Latter-day Saints render\
around the globe every day\
5:07\
of every year, but it is\
possible to calculate the good\
5:13\
the Church as an organization\
does to bless men\
5:17\
and women--boys and girls--who\
are in need of a helping hand.\
5:25\
The Church's humanitarian\
outreach was launched in 1984.\
5:29\
Then a Churchwide\
fast was held to raise\
5:35\
funds to assist those afflicted\
by a devastating drought\
5:40\
in Eastern Africa.\
5:44\
Church members\
donated $6.4 million\
5:48\
on that single fast day.\
5:55\
Then-Elder M. Russell Ballard\
and Brother Glenn L. Pace\
5:59\
were dispatched to\
Ethiopia to assess\
6:02\
how those consecrated\
funds could best be used.\
6:06\
This effort proved\
to be the beginning\
6:09\
of what would later be known\
as Latter-day Saint Charities.\
6:15\
Since that time,\
Latter-day Saint Charities\
6:18\
has provided more than\
two billion dollars in aid\
6:24\
to assist those in need\
throughout the world.\
6:29\
This assistance is offered\
to recipients regardless\
6:32\
of their Church affiliation,\
nationality, race,\
6:36\
sexual orientation, gender,\
or political persuasion.\
6:43\
That is not all.\
6:45\
To assist members of the\
Lord's Church in distress,\
6:49\
we love and live the\
ancient law of the fast.\
6:55\
We go hungry to help\
others who are hungry.\
7:00\
One day each month,\
we go without food\
7:03\
and donate the cost of\
that food (and more)\
7:08\
to help those in need.\
7:12\
I will never forget my first\
visit to West Africa in 1986.\
7:15\
The Saints came to our\
meetings in great numbers.\
7:21\
Though they had little in\
terms of material possessions,\
7:25\
most came dressed in\
spotless white clothing.\
7:31\
I asked the stake\
president how he cared\
7:34\
for members who had so little.\
7:36\
He replied that their bishops\
knew their people well.\
7:41\
If members could\
afford two meals a day,\
7:44\
no help was needed.\
7:46\
But if they could afford only\
one meal or less--even with\
7:51\
family help--bishops\
provided food,\
7:55\
financed from fast offerings.\
8:00\
Then he added this\
remarkable fact:\
8:03\
their fast-offering\
contributions usually\
8:06\
exceeded their expenses.\
8:09\
Surplus fast offerings were\
then sent to people elsewhere\
8:13\
whose needs exceeded theirs.\
8:17\
Those stalwart\
African Saints taught\
8:20\
me a great lesson about\
the power of the law\
8:25\
and the spirit of the fast.\
8:30\
As members of the\
Church, we feel a kinship\
8:32\
to those who suffer in any way.\
8:35\
As sons and daughters of God,\
we are all brothers and sisters.\
8:40\
We heed an Old\
Testament admonition:\
8:44\
"Thou shalt open thine hand wide\
unto thy brother, to thy poor,\
8:50\
and to thy needy."\
8:54\
We also strive to live the\
teachings of the Lord Jesus\
8:56\
Christ as recorded in\
Matthew chapter 25:\
8:59\
"For I was an hungred, and ye\
gave me meat: I was thirsty,\
9:06\
and ye gave me drink: I was a\
stranger, and ye took me in:\
9:13\
"Naked, and ye clothed me: I\
was sick, and ye visited me: ...\
9:19\
"...\
9:19\
Inasmuch as ye have\
done it unto one\
9:21\
of the least of\
these my brethren,\
9:23\
ye have done it unto me."\
9:29\
Let me cite just a few examples\
of how the Church follows\
9:33\
these teachings of the Savior.\
9:36\
To help relieve\
hunger, the Church\
9:38\
operates 124\
bishops' storehouses\
9:43\
throughout the world.\
9:45\
Through them, approximately\
400,000 food orders\
9:50\
are given each year to\
individuals in need.\
9:54\
In locations where\
no storehouse exists,\
9:57\
bishops and branch presidents\
draw from fast-offering funds\
10:00\
of the Church to provide\
food and supplies\
10:05\
for their needy members.\
10:10\
However, the challenge\
of hunger goes\
10:12\
far beyond the\
boundaries of the Church.\
10:15\
It is increasing\
throughout the world.\
10:18\
A recent United Nations report\
indicated that the number\
10:23\
of undernourished people in\
the world now exceeds 820\
10:26\
million--or almost one in nine\
of the earth's inhabitants.\
10:34\
What a sobering statistic!\
10:37\
How grateful we are\
for your contributions.\
10:41\
Thanks to your\
heartfelt generosity,\
10:45\
millions throughout the world\
will receive much needed food,\
10:51\
clothing, temporary shelter,\
wheelchairs, medicines,\
10:58\
clean water, and more.\
11:04\
Much sickness\
throughout the world\
11:05\
is caused because\
of unclean water.\
11:09\
To date, the Church's\
humanitarian initiative\
11:13\
has helped provide\
clean water in hundreds\
11:17\
of communities in 76 countries.\
11:20\
A project in Luputa, in\
the Democratic Republic\
11:26\
of the Congo, is\
a great example.\
11:30\
With a population\
exceeding 100,000,\
11:33\
the town had no running water.\
11:36\
Citizens had to\
walk long distances\
11:40\
for sources of safe water.\
11:43\
A mountain spring was\
discovered 18 miles away,\
11:48\
but townspeople could not access\
that water on a regular basis.\
11:55\
When our humanitarian\
missionaries\
11:57\
learned about this\
challenge, they\
11:59\
worked with the\
leaders of Luputa\
12:02\
by supplying\
materials and training\
12:04\
to pipe the water to the city.\
12:07\
The people of Luputa\
spent three years\
12:11\
digging a one-meter-deep\
trench through rock and jungle.\
12:17\
By working together,\
the joyful day finally\
12:20\
arrived when fresh, clean\
water was available to all\
12:25\
in that village.\
12:30\
The Church also helps refugees,\
whether from civil strife,\
12:34\
the ravages of nature,\
or religious persecution.\
12:39\
More than 70 million people are\
now displaced from their homes.\
12:47\
In the year 2018\
alone, the Church\
12:51\
provided emergency supplies\
to refugees in 56 countries.\
12:55\
In addition, many Church\
members volunteer their time\
13:01\
to help refugees integrate\
into new communities.\
13:06\
We thank every one\
of you who reach out\
13:09\
to help those who are trying\
to establish new homes.\
13:15\
Through generous donations\
to Deseret Industries outlets\
13:19\
in the United States,\
millions of pounds of clothing\
13:23\
are collected and\
sorted each year.\
13:27\
While local bishops\
use this vast inventory\
13:31\
to help members in need,\
the greatest portion\
13:34\
is donated to other\
charitable organizations who\
13:38\
distribute the items worldwide.\
13:43\
And just last year, the\
Church provided vision care\
13:47\
for more than 300,000\
people in 35 countries,\
13:54\
newborn care for thousands\
of mothers and infants in 39\
13:58\
countries, and wheelchairs\
for more than 50,000 people\
14:05\
living in dozens of countries.\
14:10\
The Church is well\
known for being\
14:12\
among the first responders\
when tragedy strikes.\
14:15\
Even before a hurricane hits,\
Church leaders and staff\
14:21\
in the affected locations\
are mapping out plans\
14:24\
for how they will\
deliver relief supplies\
14:29\
and volunteer assistance to\
those who will be impacted.\
14:36\
Last year alone, the Church\
carried out more than 100\
14:39\
disaster-relief projects\
around the world,\
14:43\
helping victims of hurricanes,\
fires, floods, earthquakes,\
14:48\
and other calamities.\
14:51\
Whenever possible, our Church\
members in yellow Helping Hands\
14:56\
vests mobilize in great\
numbers to help those\
15:00\
afflicted by the disaster.\
15:02\
This kind of service,\
rendered by so many of you,\
15:07\
is the very essence\
of ministering.\
15:14\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
the activities I have described\
15:17\
are merely a small part\
of the growing welfare\
15:20\
and humanitarian outreach\
of The Church of Jesus\
15:24\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
15:26\
And you are the ones who\
make all this possible.\
15:31\
Because of your exemplary\
lives, your generous hearts,\
15:36\
and your helping\
hands, it is no wonder\
15:40\
that many communities\
and government leaders\
15:42\
are praising your efforts.\
15:47\
Since becoming\
President of the Church,\
15:49\
I have been amazed at how many\
presidents, prime ministers,\
15:53\
and ambassadors have\
sincerely thanked me\
15:57\
for our humanitarian\
aid to their people.\
16:03\
And they have also expressed\
gratitude for the strength\
16:06\
that our faithful members\
bring to their country\
16:09\
as loyal, contributing citizens.\
16:14\
I have also marveled as world\
leaders have visited the First\
16:18\
Presidency expressing their\
hope for the Church to be\
16:22\
established in their lands.\
16:25\
Why?\
16:27\
Because they know\
Latter-day Saints\
16:30\
will help to build strong\
families and communities,\
16:34\
making life better for\
others wherever they live.\
16:42\
Regardless of where we call\
home, members of the Church\
16:45\
feel passionately about\
the fatherhood of God\
16:49\
and the brotherhood of man.\
16:52\
Thus, our greatest joy comes\
as we help our brothers\
16:57\
and sisters, no matter where we\
live in this wonderful world.\
17:04\
Giving help to others--making\
a conscientious effort to care\
17:09\
about others as much or\
more than we care about\
17:12\
ourselves--is our joy.\
17:18\
Especially, I might add,\
when it is not convenient\
17:22\
and when it takes us\
out of our comfort zone.\
17:25\
Living that second\
great commandment\
17:29\
is the key to becoming a true\
disciple of Jesus Christ.\
17:37\
My dear brothers\
and sisters, you\
17:39\
are living exemplars of the\
fruits that come from following\
17:42\
the teachings of Jesus Christ.\
17:45\
I thank you!\
17:47\
I love you!\
17:51\
I know that God lives.\
17:53\
Jesus is the Christ.\
17:55\
His Church has been restored\
in these latter days\
17:58\
to fulfill its divine purposes.\
18:01\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
