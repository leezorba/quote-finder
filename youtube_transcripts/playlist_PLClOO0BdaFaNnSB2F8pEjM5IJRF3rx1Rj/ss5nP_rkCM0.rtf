Brothers and sisters, thank you!\
0:04\
Thank you for all you do to\
become and to help others\
0:07\
become true followers\
of Jesus Christ\
0:10\
and enjoy the blessings\
of the holy temple.\
0:13\
Thank you for your goodness.\
0:15\
You are wonderful;\
you are beautiful.\
0:20\
It is my prayer that we will\
recognize the confirming\
0:22\
influence of the Holy Ghost\
as we come to fully understand\
0:25\
that we are children of God.\
0:28\
"The Family: A Proclamation\
to the World" states:\
0:31\
"All human beings--male\
and female--are created\
0:34\
in the image of God.\
0:35\
Each is a beloved spirit son or\
daughter of heavenly parents,\
0:39\
and, as such, each has a\
divine nature and destiny."\
0:43\
We are "choice spirits who\
were reserved to come forth\
0:46\
in the fulness of\
times to take part\
0:49\
in laying the foundations of\
the great latter-day work."\
0:52\
President Russell\
M. Nelson declared:\
0:55\
"You were taught\
in the spirit world\
0:57\
to prepare you for\
anything and everything\
0:59\
you would encounter\
during this latter part\
1:01\
of these latter days.\
1:03\
That teaching\
endures within you."\
1:07\
You are elect sons\
and daughters of God.\
1:10\
You have the power to\
overcome the adversary.\
1:13\
The adversary, however,\
is aware of who you are.\
1:16\
He knows of your divine\
heritage and seeks\
1:19\
to limit your earthly\
and heavenly potential\
1:21\
by using the three Ds:\
1:24\
Deception.\
1:26\
Distraction.\
1:27\
Discouragement.\
1:29\
The adversary used the tool of\
deception in the days of Moses.\
1:33\
The Lord declared to Moses:\
1:35\
"Behold, thou art my son. ...\
1:37\
"I have a work for thee, ...\
and thou art in the similitude\
1:40\
of mine Only Begotten."\
1:42\
Shortly after this\
glorious vision,\
1:44\
Satan attempted\
to deceive Moses.\
1:47\
The words he used\
are interesting:\
1:49\
"Moses, son of man, worship me."\
1:53\
The deception was not only\
in the invitation to worship\
1:56\
Satan, but the\
deception was also\
1:59\
in the way he described\
Moses as a son of man.\
2:02\
Remember, the Lord\
just told Moses\
2:06\
he was a son of God,\
created in the similitude\
2:09\
of the Only Begotten.\
2:11\
The adversary was relentless in\
his attempt to deceive Moses,\
2:14\
but Moses resisted,\
saying, "Depart\
2:17\
from me, Satan, for\
this one God only\
2:20\
will I worship, which\
is the God of glory."\
2:23\
Moses remembered who\
he was, a son of God.\
2:29\
The Lord's words to Moses\
apply to you and to me.\
2:32\
We are created in\
God's own image,\
2:34\
and He has a work for us to do.\
2:36\
The adversary attempts\
to deceive by having\
2:39\
us forget who we truly are.\
2:41\
If we do not\
understand who we are,\
2:44\
then it is difficult to\
recognize who we can become.\
2:50\
The adversary also attempts\
to distract us away\
2:52\
from Christ and\
His covenant path.\
2:54\
Elder Ronald A. Rasband\
shared the following:\
2:57\
"The adversary's design\
is to distract us\
2:59\
from spiritual witnesses,\
while the Lord's desire is\
3:02\
to enlighten and to\
engage us in His work."\
3:06\
In our day, there are\
many distractions,\
3:08\
including Twitter, Facebook,\
virtual reality games,\
3:10\
and much more.\
3:11\
These technological\
advances are amazing,\
3:15\
but if we are not careful,\
they can distract us\
3:18\
from fulfilling our\
divine potential.\
3:20\
Using them appropriately can\
bring forth the power of heaven\
3:24\
and allow us to\
witness miracles as we\
3:26\
seek to gather scattered Israel\
on both sides of the veil.\
3:32\
Let us be careful and not\
casual in our use of technology.\
3:37\
Continually seek for\
ways that technology\
3:39\
can draw us closer to\
the Savior and allow\
3:42\
us to accomplish His work as we\
prepare for His Second Coming.\
3:47\
Lastly, the adversary desires\
for us to become discouraged.\
3:51\
We may get discouraged when\
we compare ourselves to others\
3:54\
or feel we are not living up\
to expectations, including\
3:58\
our own.\
3:59\
When I started my doctoral\
program, I felt discouraged.\
4:03\
The program accepted only\
four students that year,\
4:06\
and the other students\
were brilliant.\
4:08\
They had higher test\
scores, more work experience\
4:11\
at senior management positions,\
and they exuded confidence\
4:14\
in their abilities.\
4:15\
After my first two\
weeks in the program,\
4:18\
feelings of discouragement\
and doubt began to take\
4:23\
hold--almost overwhelming me.\
4:27\
I decided that if I\
were going to complete\
4:29\
this four-year\
program, I would finish\
4:31\
reading the Book of\
Mormon each semester.\
4:33\
Each day as I read, I recognized\
the Savior's declaration\
4:38\
that the Holy Ghost\
would teach me all things\
4:41\
and would bring all\
things to my remembrance.\
4:44\
It reaffirmed who I\
am as a son of God,\
4:47\
reminded me not to compare\
myself with others,\
4:51\
and gave me the confidence\
in my divine role to succeed.\
4:56\
My dear friends, please\
do not let anyone\
4:59\
steal your happiness.\
5:01\
Do not compare\
yourself to others,\
5:02\
and please remember the\
loving words of the Savior:\
5:05\
"Peace I leave with you,\
my peace I give unto you:\
5:10\
not as the world\
giveth, give I unto you.\
5:12\
Let not your heart be troubled,\
neither let it be afraid."\
5:18\
So how do we do it?\
5:19\
How do we find this peace,\
remember who we are,\
5:23\
and overcome the three\
Ds of the adversary?\
5:26\
First, remember that the\
first and great commandment\
5:29\
is to love God with our heart,\
might, mind, and strength.\
5:32\
All that we do should be\
motivated by our love for Him\
5:36\
and for His Son.\
5:37\
As we develop our love for Them\
by keeping Their commandments,\
5:42\
our capacity to love\
ourselves and to love others\
5:46\
will increase.\
5:47\
We will begin to serve family\
and friends and neighbors\
5:50\
because we will see them as\
the Savior sees them--as sons\
5:56\
and daughters of God.\
5:59\
Second, pray unto the\
Father in the name\
6:01\
of Jesus Christ every\
day, every day, every day.\
6:06\
It is through prayer that\
we can feel the love of God\
6:10\
and show our love for Him.\
6:12\
Through prayer we\
express gratitude\
6:13\
and ask for the\
strength and the courage\
6:16\
to submit our will to God's\
and to be guided and directed\
6:19\
in all things.\
6:21\
I encourage you to "pray unto\
the Father with all the energy\
6:25\
of heart, that ye may be\
filled with this love, ...\
6:29\
that ye may become the sons\
[and daughters] of God;\
6:32\
that when he shall appear\
we shall be like him."\
6:37\
Third, read and study the Book\
of Mormon every day, every day,\
6:42\
every day.\
6:43\
My Book of Mormon studies\
tend to go better when\
6:46\
I read with a question in mind.\
6:49\
As we study with a question,\
we can receive revelation\
6:54\
and recognize that the Prophet\
Joseph Smith spoke truth when\
6:58\
he declared, "The Book of Mormon\
[is] the most correct of any\
7:01\
book on earth, ... and a man [or\
a woman will] get nearer to God\
7:05\
by abiding by its precepts,\
than by any other book."\
7:10\
The Book of Mormon contains\
the words of Christ\
7:14\
and helps us\
remember who we are.\
7:18\
Lastly, prayerfully partake\
of the sacrament every week,\
7:22\
every week, every week.\
7:24\
It is through covenants\
and priesthood ordinances,\
7:27\
including the sacrament,\
that the power of godliness\
7:31\
is manifest in our lives.\
7:33\
Elder David A. Bednar taught:\
"The ordinance of the sacrament\
7:37\
is a holy and repeated\
invitation to repent sincerely\
7:41\
and to be renewed spiritually.\
7:43\
The act of partaking of the\
sacrament, in and of itself,\
7:47\
does not remit [sin].\
7:48\
But as we prepare\
conscientiously and participate\
7:51\
in this holy ordinance\
with a broken heart\
7:54\
and a contrite spirit,\
then the promise\
7:57\
is that we may always have\
the Spirit of the Lord\
8:00\
to be with us."\
8:03\
As we humbly partake\
of the sacrament,\
8:05\
we remember Jesus's suffering\
in that sacred garden\
8:08\
called Gethsemane and His\
sacrifice on the cross.\
8:11\
We express gratitude\
to the Father\
8:14\
for sending His Only\
Begotten Son, our Redeemer,\
8:18\
and show our willingness\
to keep His commandments\
8:21\
and to always remember Him.\
8:24\
There is a spiritual\
enlightenment associated with\
8:28\
the sacrament--it is\
personal, it is powerful,\
8:33\
and it is needed.\
8:36\
My friends, I promise\
that as we strive\
8:39\
to love God with all our heart,\
pray in the name of Jesus\
8:43\
Christ, study the\
Book of Mormon,\
8:44\
and prayerfully partake\
of the sacrament,\
8:47\
we will have the ability,\
with the strength of the Lord,\
8:50\
to overcome the deceptive\
practices of the adversary,\
8:54\
to minimize distractions that\
limit our divine potential,\
8:58\
and to resist the discouragement\
that diminishes our capacity\
9:02\
to feel the love of our\
Heavenly Father and His Son.\
9:06\
We will come to fully\
understand who we are\
9:11\
as sons and daughters of God.\
9:16\
Brothers and sisters, I\
share with you my love\
9:20\
and I declare unto\
you my witness\
9:24\
that I know Heavenly Father\
lives and Jesus is the Christ.\
9:29\
I love Them.\
9:31\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints\
9:34\
is God's kingdom upon the earth.\
9:36\
And we have a divine\
appointment to gather Israel\
9:41\
and to prepare the world for the\
Second Coming of the Messiah.\
9:46\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
