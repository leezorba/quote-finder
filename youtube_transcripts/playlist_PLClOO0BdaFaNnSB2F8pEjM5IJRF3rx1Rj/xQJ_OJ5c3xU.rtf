My dear brothers and sisters,\
I have prayed for the power\
0:08\
to help you in your personal\
search for happiness.\
0:15\
Some might feel\
happy enough already,\
0:18\
yet surely no one would reject\
the offer of more happiness.\
0:24\
Anyone would be eager\
to accept a guaranteed\
0:29\
offer of lasting happiness.\
0:34\
That is what our Heavenly\
Father; His Beloved Son, Jesus\
0:40\
Christ; and the Holy Ghost\
have offered you and me,\
0:47\
every child of\
Heavenly Father who\
0:49\
now lives, will live, or\
ever has lived in this world.\
0:55\
That offer is sometimes\
called the plan of happiness.\
1:03\
It was so called\
by the prophet Alma\
1:07\
as he taught his son who was\
mired in the misery of sin.\
1:15\
Alma knew that wickedness never\
could be happiness for his\
1:21\
son--or for any child\
of Heavenly Father.\
1:27\
He taught his son that\
increasing in holiness\
1:33\
was the only path to happiness.\
1:37\
He made it plain that greater\
holiness is made possible\
1:43\
through the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ\
1:46\
cleansing and perfecting us.\
1:51\
Only by faith in Jesus\
Christ, continuing repentance,\
1:58\
and keeping covenants\
are we able to claim\
2:03\
the lasting happiness we all\
yearn to experience and retain.\
2:12\
My prayer for you\
today is that I\
2:17\
may help you understand\
that greater happiness comes\
2:22\
from greater personal\
holiness so that you\
2:27\
will act upon that belief.\
2:30\
I will then share what I\
know for myself about what\
2:34\
we can do to qualify for that\
gift of becoming ever more\
2:41\
holy.\
2:43\
The scriptures teach us\
that among other things,\
2:48\
we can be sanctified or become\
more holy when we exercise\
2:54\
faith in Christ, demonstrate\
by obedience and repent\
2:59\
and sacrifice for Him,\
receive sacred ordinances,\
3:04\
and keep our covenants with Him.\
3:07\
Qualifying for the\
gift of holiness\
3:11\
requires humility,\
meekness, and patience.\
3:17\
One experience of\
wanting more holiness\
3:20\
came for me in the\
Salt Lake Temple.\
3:23\
I entered the temple\
for the first time\
3:26\
having been told little of\
what to expect in a temple.\
3:31\
I had seen the words on the\
building: Holiness to the Lord\
3:36\
and The House of the Lord.\
3:38\
I felt a great sense\
of anticipation.\
3:42\
Yet I wondered if I\
was prepared to enter.\
3:48\
My mother and father\
walked ahead of me\
3:51\
as we entered the temple.\
3:53\
We were asked to\
show our recommends,\
3:56\
certifying our worthiness.\
3:59\
My parents knew the man\
at the recommend desk.\
4:02\
So they lingered a\
moment to speak with him.\
4:06\
I went ahead alone\
into a large space\
4:11\
where everything\
was sparkling white.\
4:15\
I looked up at a\
ceiling so high above me\
4:19\
that it seemed an open sky.\
4:22\
In that moment, a\
clear impression\
4:25\
came to me that I had\
been there before.\
4:30\
But then I heard\
a very soft voice.\
4:34\
it was not my own.\
4:36\
The softly spoken\
words in my mind\
4:40\
were these: "You have\
never been here before.\
4:44\
You are remembering a\
moment before you were born.\
4:49\
You were in a place, a\
sacred place like this.\
4:54\
You felt the Savior was\
about to come into the place\
4:58\
where you stood.\
5:00\
And you felt happiness because\
you were eager to see Him."\
5:09\
That experience in the Salt Lake\
Temple lasted only a moment.\
5:14\
Yet the memory of it\
still brings peace, joy,\
5:18\
and quiet happiness.\
5:22\
I learned many lessons that day.\
5:24\
One was that the Holy Ghost\
speaks in a still, small voice.\
5:33\
I can hear Him when there is\
spiritual peace in my heart.\
5:38\
He brings a feeling of\
happiness and assurance\
5:43\
that I am becoming more holy.\
5:47\
And that always\
brings the happiness\
5:49\
I felt in those first\
moments in a temple of God.\
5:56\
You have observed in your own\
life and in the lives of others\
6:00\
the miracle of happiness\
coming from growing holiness,\
6:05\
becoming more like the Savior.\
6:07\
In recent weeks, I have\
been at the bedside\
6:11\
of people who could face death\
with full faith in the Savior\
6:17\
and with happy countenances.\
6:20\
One was a man surrounded\
by his family.\
6:24\
He and his wife were\
chatting quietly as my son\
6:29\
and I entered the bedroom.\
6:30\
I had known them for many years.\
6:33\
I had seen the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ work\
6:38\
in their lives and in the\
lives of their family members.\
6:43\
They had together chosen\
to end medical efforts\
6:48\
to prolong his life.\
6:52\
There was a quiet feeling\
as he spoke to us.\
6:55\
He smiled as he expressed\
gratitude for the gospel\
7:00\
and its purifying effects on\
him and the family he loved.\
7:06\
He spoke of his happy years\
of service in the temple.\
7:12\
At this man's request,\
my son anointed his head\
7:17\
with consecrated oil.\
7:20\
I sealed the anointing.\
7:22\
As I did, I had a\
clear impression\
7:26\
to tell him that he would soon\
see his Savior face-to-face.\
7:35\
I promised him that he\
would feel happiness, love,\
7:40\
and the Savior's approval.\
7:43\
He smiled warmly as we left.\
7:46\
His last words to me were\
"Tell Kathy I love her."\
7:51\
My wife, Kathleen,\
over many years\
7:54\
had encouraged\
generations of his family\
7:57\
to accept the Savior's\
invitation to come unto Him,\
8:03\
make and keep sacred\
covenants, and so qualify\
8:10\
for the happiness that comes\
as a result of that greater\
8:15\
holiness.\
8:17\
He died hours later.\
8:19\
Within weeks of his\
passing, his widow\
8:23\
brought a gift to\
my wife and me.\
8:28\
She smiled as we talked.\
8:30\
She said pleasantly,\
"I expected that I\
8:35\
would feel sad and lonely.\
8:37\
I feel so happy.\
8:39\
Do you think that's all right?"\
8:40\
[LAUGHTER]\
8:43\
Knowing how much she loved her\
husband and how both of them\
8:46\
had come to know, love,\
and serve the Lord,\
8:50\
I told her that her\
feelings of happiness\
8:53\
were a promised gift\
because she had,\
8:56\
by her faithful service,\
been made more holy.\
9:00\
Her holiness had qualified\
her for that happiness.\
9:07\
Now, some listening\
today may be wondering:\
9:10\
"Why do I not feel the peace\
and happiness promised to those\
9:14\
who have been faithful?\
9:16\
I have been faithful\
through terrible adversity,\
9:19\
but I don't feel happiness."\
9:22\
Even the Prophet Joseph\
Smith faced this test.\
9:27\
He prayed for relief\
when he was confined\
9:30\
in a jail in Liberty, Missouri.\
9:33\
He had been faithful\
to the Lord.\
9:36\
He had grown in holiness.\
9:39\
Yet he felt happiness\
had been denied.\
9:44\
The Lord taught him\
the lesson of patience\
9:47\
we all will need at some time,\
and perhaps for long periods,\
9:53\
in our mortal testing.\
9:55\
Here is the Lord's message\
to His faithful and suffering\
10:00\
prophet:\
10:02\
"And if thou shouldst\
be cast into the pit,\
10:07\
or into the hands of murderers,\
and the sentence of death\
10:12\
passed upon thee; if thou\
be cast into the deep;\
10:17\
if the billowing surge\
conspire against thee;\
10:22\
if fierce winds\
become thine enemy;\
10:25\
if the heavens gather blackness,\
and all the elements combine\
10:30\
to hedge up the way; and above\
all, if the very jaws of hell\
10:36\
shall gape open the\
mouth wide after thee,\
10:39\
know thou, my son,\
that all these things\
10:43\
shall give thee experience,\
and shall be for thy good.\
10:49\
"The Son of Man hath\
descended below them all.\
10:52\
Art thou greater than he?\
10:55\
"Therefore, hold on [the] way,\
and the priesthood shall remain\
11:00\
with thee; for their bounds\
are set, they cannot pass.\
11:04\
Thy days are known,\
and thy years shall not\
11:08\
be numbered less; therefore,\
fear not what man can do,\
11:13\
for God shall be with\
you forever and ever."\
11:20\
That was the same\
instructive lesson\
11:23\
the Lord gave Job, who\
paid a heavy price to allow\
11:28\
the Atonement to\
make him more holy.\
11:30\
We know that Job was holy,\
from the introduction we have\
11:35\
of him: "There was a man in the\
land of Uz, whose name was Job;\
11:41\
and that man was perfect,\
was perfect, and upright,\
11:46\
and one that feared\
God, and eschewed evil."\
11:52\
Then Job lost his wealth,\
his family, even his health.\
11:58\
You might remember\
that Job doubted\
12:01\
that his greater holiness,\
gained through great adversity,\
12:06\
had qualified him for\
greater happiness.\
12:09\
It seemed to Job that holiness\
had only brought misery.\
12:15\
Yet the Lord gave Job the\
same correcting lesson\
12:19\
He gave Joseph Smith.\
12:21\
He let Job see his heartbreaking\
situation with spiritual eyes.\
12:27\
He said:\
12:30\
"Gird up now thy loins like a\
man; for I will demand of thee,\
12:34\
and answer thou me.\
12:36\
"Where wast thou when I laid\
the foundations of the earth?\
12:40\
declare, if thou\
hast understanding.\
12:44\
"Who hath laid the measures\
thereof, ... thou knowest?\
12:47\
or who hath stretched\
the line upon it?\
12:51\
"Whereupon are the\
foundations thereof fastened?\
12:54\
or who laid the\
corner stone thereof;\
12:58\
"When the morning\
stars sang together,\
13:00\
and all the sons of\
God shouted for joy?"\
13:05\
Then, after Job repented\
of calling God unfair,\
13:11\
Job was permitted\
to see his trials\
13:14\
in a higher and holier way.\
13:17\
He had repented.\
13:21\
"Then Job answered\
the Lord and said,\
13:24\
"I know that thou\
canst do every thing,\
13:27\
and that no thought can\
be withholden from thee.\
13:32\
"Who is he that hideth\
counsel without knowledge?\
13:35\
therefore have I uttered\
that I understood not;\
13:38\
things too wonderful for\
me, which I knew not.\
13:42\
"Hear, I beseech thee,\
and I will speak:\
13:45\
I will demand of thee,\
and declare thou unto me.\
13:49\
"I have heard of thee by\
the hearing of the ear:\
13:53\
but now mine eye seeth thee.\
13:58\
"Wherefore I abhor myself,\
and repent in dust and ashes."\
14:05\
After Job repented and\
so became more holy,\
14:09\
the Lord blessed him\
beyond all he had lost.\
14:13\
But perhaps the greatest\
blessing for Job\
14:17\
was to have increased in\
holiness through adversity\
14:21\
and repentance.\
14:23\
He was qualified to\
have greater happiness\
14:27\
in the days he had yet to live.\
14:31\
Greater holiness will not\
come simply by asking for it.\
14:36\
It will come by doing what is\
needed for God to change us.\
14:41\
President Russell\
M. Nelson has given\
14:43\
what seems to me\
the best counsel\
14:46\
of how to move\
along the covenant\
14:49\
path to greater holiness.\
14:52\
He pointed the\
way when he urged:\
14:56\
"Experience the strengthening\
power of daily repentance--of\
15:01\
doing and being a\
little better each day.\
15:05\
"When we choose to repent,\
we choose to change!\
15:09\
We allow the Savior\
to transform us\
15:13\
into the best\
version of ourselves.\
15:16\
We choose to grow spiritually\
and receive joy--the joy\
15:22\
of redemption in Him.\
15:24\
When we choose to repent,\
we choose to become more\
15:29\
like Jesus Christ!"\
15:32\
President Nelson went on to\
give us this encouragement\
15:35\
in our efforts to become holier:\
"The Lord does not expect\
15:40\
perfection from us\
at this point. ...\
15:43\
But He does expect us to\
become increasingly pure.\
15:48\
Daily repentance is\
the pathway to purity."\
15:54\
President Dallin H. Oaks, in\
an earlier conference address,\
15:57\
also helped me see more\
clearly how we grow in holiness\
16:02\
and how we can know we\
are moving toward it.\
16:04\
He said: "How do we\
achieve spirituality?\
16:10\
How do we attain that\
degree of holiness\
16:14\
where we can have the\
constant companionship\
16:17\
of the Holy Ghost?\
16:18\
How do we come to view and\
evaluate things of this world\
16:23\
with the perspective\
of eternity?"\
16:27\
President Oaks's answer\
begins with greater faith\
16:30\
in Jesus Christ as\
our loving Savior.\
16:34\
That leads us to seek\
forgiveness every day\
16:38\
and to remember Him every day\
by keeping His commandments.\
16:43\
That greater faith\
in Jesus Christ\
16:45\
comes as we feast\
daily on His word.\
16:50\
The hymn "More Holiness\
Give Me" suggests a way\
16:56\
to pray for help in\
becoming more holy.\
16:59\
The author of that\
music wisely suggests\
17:03\
that the holiness we seek is a\
gift from a loving God, granted\
17:09\
over time, after all we can do.\
17:13\
You remember the last verse:\
17:16\
"More purity give me,\
17:19\
More strength to o'ercome,\
17:21\
More freedom from earth-stains,\
17:25\
More longing for home.\
17:27\
More fit for the kingdom,\
17:29\
More used would I be,\
17:32\
More blessed and holy--\
17:35\
More, Savior, like thee."\
17:39\
Whatever our personal\
circumstance, wherever\
17:42\
we may be on the\
covenant path home,\
17:45\
may our prayers for greater\
holiness be answered.\
17:49\
I know that as our\
petition is granted,\
17:53\
our happiness will increase.\
17:56\
It may come slowly,\
but it will come.\
17:59\
I have that assurance from\
a loving Heavenly Father\
18:03\
and His Beloved\
Son, Jesus Christ.\
18:07\
I testify that Joseph\
Smith was a prophet of God,\
18:11\
that President Russell M. Nelson\
is our living prophet today.\
18:15\
God the Father\
lives and loves us\
18:20\
and wants us to come\
home to Him in families.\
18:24\
Our loving Savior invites us\
to follow Him on our journey\
18:29\
there.\
18:30\
They have prepared the way.\
18:33\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
