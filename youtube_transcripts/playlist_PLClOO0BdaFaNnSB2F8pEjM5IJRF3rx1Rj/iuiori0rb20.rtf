My dear brothers and sisters, a\
letter I received some time ago\
0:07\
introduces the\
subject of my talk.\
0:10\
The writer was contemplating\
a temple marriage\
0:15\
to a man whose eternal\
companion had died.\
0:19\
She would be a second wife.\
0:23\
She asked this\
question: would she\
0:27\
be able to have her own\
house in the next life,\
0:31\
or would she have to live with\
her husband and his first wife?\
0:39\
I just told her\
to trust the Lord.\
0:45\
I continue with an\
experience I heard\
0:47\
from a trusted associate, which\
I share with his permission.\
0:52\
After the death\
of a beloved wife\
0:55\
and mother of his children,\
a father remarried.\
1:00\
Some grown children strongly\
objected to the remarriage\
1:05\
and sought the counsel\
of a close relative who\
1:09\
was a respected Church leader.\
1:11\
After hearing the reasons\
for their objections, which\
1:16\
focused on conditions\
and relationships\
1:19\
in the spirit world or in\
the kingdoms of glory that\
1:23\
follow the final\
judgment, this leader\
1:27\
said: "You are worried\
about the wrong things.\
1:32\
You should be worried\
about whether you\
1:35\
will get to those places."\
1:37\
[LAUGHTER]\
1:38\
"Concentrate on that.\
1:41\
If you get there, all of\
it will be more wonderful\
1:45\
than you can imagine."\
1:49\
What a comforting teaching!\
1:51\
Trust the Lord!\
1:54\
From letters I have\
received, I know\
1:56\
that others are troubled by\
questions about the spirit\
1:59\
world we will\
inhabit after we die\
2:02\
and before we are resurrected.\
2:05\
Some assume that\
the spirit world\
2:08\
will continue many of the\
temporal circumstances\
2:12\
and issues we experience\
in this mortal life.\
2:17\
What do we really know about\
conditions in the spirit world?\
2:23\
I believe a BYU religion\
professor's article on this\
2:28\
subject had it right--he wrote:\
"When we ask ourselves what we\
2:34\
know about the spirit world\
from the standard works,\
2:39\
the answer is 'not as\
much as we often think.'"\
2:46\
Of course, we know\
from the scriptures\
2:48\
that after our bodies\
die, we continue to live\
2:52\
as spirits in the spirit world.\
2:55\
The scriptures also teach\
that this spirit world\
2:58\
is divided between those\
who have been "righteous"\
3:02\
or "just" during life and\
those who have been wicked.\
3:08\
They also describe how\
some faithful spirits\
3:12\
teach the gospel to those who\
have been wicked or rebellious.\
3:17\
Most important,\
modern revelation\
3:21\
reveals that the\
work of salvation\
3:23\
goes forward in\
the spirit world,\
3:26\
and although we are urged not\
to procrastinate our repentance\
3:32\
during mortality, we are\
taught that some repentance is\
3:37\
possible there.\
3:41\
The work of salvation\
in the spirit world\
3:43\
consists of freeing spirits from\
what the scriptures frequently\
3:48\
describe as "bondage."\
3:50\
All in the spirit world are\
under some form of bondage.\
3:55\
President Joseph F.\
Smith's great revelation,\
3:59\
canonized in section 138 of\
the Doctrine and Covenants,\
4:04\
states that the righteous dead,\
who were in a state of "peace"\
4:11\
as they anticipated\
the Resurrection,\
4:14\
"had looked upon the long\
absence of their spirits\
4:19\
from their bodies as a bondage."\
4:25\
The wicked also suffer\
an additional bondage.\
4:29\
Because of unrepented\
sins, they are\
4:33\
in what the Apostle Peter\
referred to as spirit "prison."\
4:38\
These spirits are described\
as "bound" or as "captives"\
4:44\
or as "cast ... into outer\
darkness" with "weeping,\
4:48\
and wailing, and\
gnashing of teeth"\
4:50\
as they await\
resurrection and judgment.\
4:56\
Resurrection for all\
in the spirit world\
4:58\
is assured by the\
Resurrection of Jesus Christ,\
5:02\
though it occurs at different\
times for different groups.\
5:06\
Until that appointed time,\
what the scriptures tell us\
5:11\
about activity in the\
spirit world principally\
5:15\
concerns the work of salvation.\
5:18\
Little else is revealed.\
5:20\
The gospel is preached to the\
ignorant, the unrepentant,\
5:25\
and the rebellious so they can\
be freed from their bondage\
5:29\
and go forward to the blessings\
a loving Heavenly Father has\
5:33\
in store for them.\
5:36\
The spirit-world bondage that\
applies to righteous converted\
5:41\
souls is their need to\
await--and perhaps even to be\
5:46\
allowed to prompt--the\
performance of their proxy\
5:50\
ordinances on earth so they\
can be baptized and enjoy\
5:55\
the blessings of the Holy Ghost.\
5:58\
These mortal proxy\
ordinances also\
6:01\
empower them to go forward\
under priesthood authority\
6:06\
to enlarge the hosts\
of the righteous who\
6:10\
can preach the gospel to\
the spirits in prison.\
6:15\
Beyond these basics,\
our canon of scripture\
6:18\
contains very little\
about the spirit\
6:21\
world that follows death and\
precedes the Final Judgment.\
6:28\
So what else do we know\
about the spirit world?\
6:32\
Many members of\
the Church have had\
6:34\
visions or other\
inspirations to inform them\
6:39\
about how things operate or are\
organized in the spirit world,\
6:44\
but these personal\
spiritual experiences\
6:49\
are not to be\
understood or taught\
6:51\
as the official\
doctrine of the Church.\
6:55\
And, of course, there\
is abundant speculation\
6:59\
by members and others in\
published sources like books\
7:03\
on near-death experiences.\
7:06\
As to all of these,\
the wise cautions\
7:09\
of Elders D. Todd Christofferson\
and Neil L. Andersen\
7:14\
in earlier general\
conference messages\
7:17\
are important to remember.\
7:19\
Elder Christofferson\
taught: "It should\
7:23\
be remembered that not\
every statement made\
7:26\
by a Church leader, past\
or present, necessarily\
7:31\
constitutes doctrine.\
7:33\
It is commonly\
understood in the Church\
7:36\
that a statement made by one\
leader on a single occasion\
7:41\
often represents a personal,\
though well-considered,\
7:45\
opinion, not meant to\
be official or binding\
7:49\
for the whole Church."\
7:53\
In the following\
conference, Elder Andersen\
7:55\
taught this principle:\
"The doctrine\
7:59\
is taught by all 15 members\
of the First Presidency\
8:03\
and Quorum of the Twelve.\
8:05\
It is not hidden in an obscure\
paragraph of one talk."\
8:10\
The family proclamation, signed\
by all 15 prophets, seers,\
8:18\
and revelators, is a wonderful\
illustration of that principle.\
8:24\
Beyond something as formal\
as the family proclamation,\
8:27\
the prophetic teachings of\
the Presidents of the Church,\
8:32\
affirmed by other\
prophets and apostles,\
8:35\
are also an example of this.\
8:38\
As to circumstances\
in the spirit world,\
8:41\
the Prophet Joseph\
Smith gave two teachings\
8:45\
near the close of\
his ministry that\
8:47\
have been frequently\
taught by his successors.\
8:51\
One of these is his teaching\
in the King Follett sermon\
8:55\
that family members\
who were righteous\
8:59\
will be together in\
the world of spirits.\
9:02\
Another is this statement at a\
funeral in the last year of his\
9:07\
life: "The spirits of the\
just are exalted to a greater\
9:13\
and more glorious work ...\
[in] the world of spirits.\
9:16\
...\
9:17\
They are not far from us,\
and know and understand\
9:20\
our thoughts,\
feelings, and motions,\
9:23\
and are often pained therewith."\
9:30\
So, what about a question\
like I mentioned earlier about\
9:33\
where spirits live?\
9:35\
If that question seems\
strange or trivial to you,\
9:39\
consider many of your own\
questions, or even those\
9:43\
you have been tempted to answer\
on the basis of something\
9:46\
you heard from another\
person sometime in the past.\
9:51\
For all questions\
about the spirit world,\
9:54\
I suggest two answers.\
9:57\
First, remember that\
God loves His children\
10:01\
and will surely do what\
is best for each of us.\
10:06\
Second, remember this\
familiar Bible teaching,\
10:11\
which has been\
most helpful to me\
10:14\
on a multitude of\
unanswered questions:\
10:18\
"Trust in the Lord with\
all thine heart; and\
10:21\
lean not unto thine\
own understanding.\
10:25\
"In all thy ways\
acknowledge him,\
10:28\
and he shall direct thy paths."\
10:32\
Similarly, Nephi\
concluded his great psalm\
10:36\
with these words: "O Lord,\
I have trusted in thee,\
10:40\
and I will trust\
in thee forever.\
10:43\
I will not put my trust\
in the arm of flesh."\
10:49\
We can all wonder privately\
about circumstances\
10:52\
in the spirit world\
or even discuss\
10:55\
these or other unanswered\
questions in family\
10:58\
or other intimate settings.\
11:00\
But let us not teach or\
use as official doctrine\
11:04\
what does not meet the\
standards of official doctrine.\
11:09\
To do so does not further\
the work of the Lord\
11:13\
and may even\
discourage individuals\
11:15\
from seeking their own\
comfort or edification\
11:19\
through the personal\
revelation the Lord's plan\
11:23\
provides for each of us.\
11:25\
Excessive reliance on personal\
teachings or speculations\
11:30\
may even draw us aside\
from concentrating\
11:33\
on learning and efforts that\
will further our understanding\
11:38\
and help us go forward\
on the covenant path.\
11:43\
Trust in the Lord is a\
familiar and true teaching\
11:47\
in The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
11:50\
That was Joseph Smith's\
teaching when the early Saints\
11:55\
experienced severe persecutions\
and seemingly insurmountable\
12:00\
obstacles.\
12:02\
That is still the\
best principle we\
12:04\
can use when our efforts to\
learn or our attempts to find\
12:09\
comfort encounter\
obstacles in matters\
12:12\
not yet revealed or not adopted\
as the official doctrine\
12:16\
of the Church.\
12:19\
That same principle applies\
to unanswered questions\
12:22\
about sealings in the next\
life or desired readjustments\
12:27\
because of events or\
transgressions in mortality.\
12:32\
There is so much we do not know\
that our only sure reliance is\
12:38\
to trust in the Lord and\
His love for His children.\
12:45\
In conclusion, what we\
do know about the spirit\
12:48\
world is that the Father's and\
the Son's work of salvation\
12:53\
continues there.\
12:55\
Our Savior initiated the\
work of declaring liberty\
12:59\
to the captives, and\
that work continues\
13:04\
as worthy and qualified\
messengers continue\
13:07\
to preach the gospel, including\
repentance, to those who still\
13:12\
need its cleansing effect.\
13:14\
The object of all\
of that is described\
13:18\
in the official\
doctrine of the Church,\
13:20\
given in modern revelation:\
13:24\
"The dead who repent\
will be redeemed,\
13:27\
through obedience to the\
ordinances of the house of God,\
13:33\
"And after they have\
paid the penalty\
13:35\
of their transgressions,\
and are washed clean,\
13:38\
shall receive a reward\
according to their works,\
13:42\
for they are heirs\
of salvation."\
13:48\
The duty of each\
of us is to teach\
13:50\
the doctrine of the restored\
gospel, keep the commandments,\
13:55\
love and help one another,\
and do the work of salvation\
13:59\
in the holy temples.\
14:02\
I testify of the truth\
of what I have said here\
14:05\
and of the truths taught and to\
be taught in this conference.\
14:10\
This is all made possible\
because of the Atonement\
14:14\
of Jesus Christ.\
14:16\
As we know from\
modern revelation,\
14:19\
He "glorifies the\
Father, and saves\
14:23\
all the works of his hands."\
14:26\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
