Last April, I had the\
privilege of dedicating\
0:05\
the Kinshasa Democratic\
Republic of the Congo Temple.\
0:09\
Words can't express the\
joy the faithful Congolese\
0:13\
and I felt to see a temple\
dedicated in their land.\
0:18\
Individuals who enter\
the Kinshasa temple\
0:21\
see an original painting\
entitled Congo Falls.\
0:25\
It uniquely reminds temple-goers\
of the unwavering commitment\
0:30\
required to anchor\
themselves to Jesus Christ\
0:33\
and to follow the covenant path\
of our Heavenly Father's plan.\
0:37\
The waterfalls depicted\
in the painting\
0:40\
call to mind a practice\
that was common\
0:43\
more than a century ago among\
early converts to Christianity\
0:46\
in Congo.\
0:49\
Before their conversion, they\
worshipped inanimate objects,\
0:52\
believing that the items\
possess supernatural powers.\
0:56\
After conversion,\
many made a pilgrimage\
1:00\
to one of the countless\
waterfalls along the Congo\
1:02\
River, such as the Nzongo Falls.\
1:05\
These converts threw their\
previously idolized objects\
1:10\
into the waterfalls as a\
symbol to God and others\
1:15\
that they had discarded\
their old traditions\
1:18\
and accepted Jesus Christ.\
1:20\
They intentionally did\
not throw their objects\
1:22\
into calm, shallow\
waters; they threw them\
1:25\
into the churning waters of\
a massive waterfall, where\
1:29\
the items would\
become unrecoverable.\
1:32\
These actions were a token of\
a new but unwavering commitment\
1:37\
to Jesus Christ.\
1:40\
People in other ages and places\
demonstrated their commitment\
1:44\
to Jesus Christ in similar ways.\
1:47\
The Book of Mormon people known\
as the Anti-Nephi-Lehies "laid\
1:52\
down the weapons of\
their rebellion,"\
1:54\
burying them "deep in the earth"\
as "a testimony to God ...\
1:58\
that they never would use\
[their] weapons again."\
2:01\
In doing so, they promised\
to follow God's teachings\
2:05\
and never go back\
on their commitment.\
2:09\
This action was the beginning of\
being "converted unto the Lord"\
2:13\
and never falling away.\
2:17\
Being "converted\
unto the Lord" means\
2:19\
leaving one course of action,\
directed by an old belief\
2:23\
system, and adopting\
a new one based\
2:26\
on faith in Heavenly\
Father's plan\
2:28\
and in Jesus Christ\
and His Atonement.\
2:31\
This change is more than\
an intellectual acceptance\
2:36\
of gospel teachings.\
2:37\
It shapes our identity,\
transforms our understanding\
2:42\
of life's meaning, and leads\
to unchanging fidelity to God.\
2:47\
Personal desires that are\
contrary to being anchored\
2:51\
to the Savior and to following\
the covenant path fade away\
2:55\
and are replaced\
by a determination\
2:57\
to submit to the will\
of Heavenly Father.\
3:02\
Being converted\
unto the Lord starts\
3:04\
with an unwavering\
commitment to God,\
3:07\
followed by making that\
commitment part of who we are.\
3:11\
Internalizing such a commitment\
is a lifelong process\
3:16\
that requires patience\
and ongoing repentance.\
3:21\
Eventually, this\
commitment becomes\
3:24\
part of who we are, embedded\
in our sense of self,\
3:28\
and ever present in our lives.\
3:31\
Just as we never forget\
our own name no matter\
3:34\
what else we are\
thinking about, we never\
3:37\
forget a commitment that\
is etched in our hearts.\
3:42\
God invites us to cast our old\
ways completely out of reach\
3:47\
and begin a new life in Christ.\
3:50\
This happens as we develop\
faith in the Savior, which\
3:55\
begins by hearing the testimony\
of those who have faith.\
3:58\
Thereafter, faith deepens\
as we act in ways that\
4:03\
anchor us more firmly to Him.\
4:07\
Now it'd be nice\
if increased faith\
4:10\
were transmitted like the\
flu or the common cold.\
4:14\
Then a simple "spiritual" sneeze\
would build faith in others.\
4:20\
But it does not work that way.\
4:22\
The only way faith grows is for\
an individual to act in faith.\
4:27\
These actions are often\
prompted by invitations extended\
4:31\
by others, but we cannot "grow"\
someone else's faith or rely\
4:37\
solely on others\
to bolster our own.\
4:40\
For our faith to grow, we must\
choose faith-building actions,\
4:46\
such as praying,\
scripture study, partaking\
4:50\
of the sacrament,\
keeping the commandments,\
4:54\
and serving others.\
4:56\
As our faith in\
Jesus Christ grows,\
4:59\
God invites us to make\
promises with Him.\
5:03\
These covenants, as\
such promises are known,\
5:06\
are manifestations\
of our conversion.\
5:09\
Covenants also create\
a sure foundation\
5:13\
for spiritual progression.\
5:15\
As we choose to be\
baptized, we begin\
5:18\
to take upon ourselves\
the name of Jesus Christ\
5:21\
and choose to identify\
ourselves with Him.\
5:24\
We pledge to become like Him\
and to develop His attributes.\
5:30\
Covenants anchor\
us to the Savior\
5:32\
and propel us\
along the path that\
5:35\
leads to our heavenly home.\
5:36\
The power of covenants helps\
us maintain the mighty change\
5:41\
of heart, deepen our\
conversion to the Lord,\
5:44\
and receive Christ's image\
more fully in our countenance.\
5:48\
But a half-hearted\
commitment to our covenants\
5:52\
will not guarantee us anything.\
5:56\
We may be tempted to equivocate,\
throw our old ways in calm\
6:01\
water, or bury our\
weapons of rebellion\
6:04\
with the handles sticking out.\
6:06\
But an ambivalent\
commitment to our covenants\
6:10\
will not open the door to the\
sanctifying power of Heavenly\
6:15\
Father and Jesus Christ.\
6:18\
Our commitment to\
keep our covenants\
6:20\
should not be conditional\
or vary with changing\
6:23\
circumstances in our lives.\
6:25\
Our constancy to God should\
be like the dependable Congo\
6:30\
River that flows near\
the Kinshasa temple.\
6:33\
This river, unlike most\
rivers in the world,\
6:37\
has constant flow all year\
and pours nearly 11 millions\
6:42\
of gallons of water per second\
into the Atlantic Ocean.\
6:47\
The Savior invited\
His disciples to be\
6:50\
this dependable and steadfast.\
6:53\
He said, "Wherefore,\
settle this in your hearts,\
6:56\
that ye will do the things\
which I shall teach,\
6:59\
and command you."\
7:01\
A "settled" determination\
to keep our covenants\
7:04\
allows for the full realization\
of God's promise of enduring\
7:09\
joy.\
7:11\
Many faithful Latter-day\
Saints have demonstrated\
7:14\
that they are\
"settled" in keeping\
7:16\
their covenants with God\
and are forever changed.\
7:19\
Let me tell you about three\
such individuals--Brother Banza\
7:23\
Mucioko, Sister Banza Regine,\
and Brother Mbuyi Nkitabungi.\
7:29\
In 1977, the Banzas\
lived in Kinshasa,\
7:33\
in the country of\
Zaire, now known\
7:35\
as the Democratic\
Republic of the Congo.\
7:38\
They were highly respected\
in their Protestant church\
7:41\
community.\
7:42\
Because of their\
talents, their church\
7:45\
arranged for their young family\
to go to Switzerland to study\
7:50\
and provided a\
university scholarship.\
7:54\
While in Geneva on the\
bus route to school,\
7:57\
Brother Banza frequently\
saw a small meetinghouse\
8:01\
with the name "The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
8:05\
Saints."\
8:06\
He wondered, "Does Jesus\
Christ have Saints now,\
8:10\
in the latter days?"\
8:12\
He eventually decided\
to go and see.\
8:16\
Brother and Sister Banza were\
greeted warmly at the branch.\
8:19\
They asked some of the\
persistent questions\
8:22\
they had about the\
nature of God, such\
8:24\
as "If God is a\
spirit, like the wind,\
8:28\
how could we be created\
in His likeness?\
8:31\
How could He sit on a throne?"\
8:34\
They had never received\
a satisfactory answer\
8:38\
until the missionaries\
explained restored doctrine\
8:41\
in a brief lesson.\
8:42\
When the missionaries left,\
the Banzas looked at each other\
8:46\
and said, "Isn't this the\
truth that we have heard?"\
8:51\
They continued coming\
to church and meeting\
8:55\
with the missionaries.\
8:56\
They knew that baptism in the\
restored Church of Jesus Christ\
9:02\
would have consequences.\
9:04\
They would be stripped\
of their scholarships,\
9:07\
their visas would be revoked,\
and they and their two\
9:11\
young children would be\
required to leave Switzerland.\
9:14\
They chose to be baptized and\
confirmed in October 1979.\
9:21\
Two weeks after their baptism,\
Brother and Sister Banza\
9:24\
returned to Kinshasa as the\
first and second members\
9:27\
of the Church in their country.\
9:29\
The members of the Geneva branch\
stayed in contact with them\
9:33\
and helped them connect\
with Church leaders.\
9:36\
The Banzas were encouraged\
to faithfully await\
9:39\
the promised time when God would\
establish His Church in Zaire.\
9:45\
Meanwhile, another\
exchange student\
9:47\
from Zaire, Brother Mbuyi,\
was studying in Belgium.\
9:51\
He was baptized in 1980\
in the Brussels ward.\
9:55\
Soon thereafter, he served a\
full-time mission to England.\
9:58\
And God worked His miracles.\
10:01\
Brother Mbuyi returned to\
Zaire as the third member\
10:04\
of the Church in his country.\
10:06\
With parental permission,\
Church meetings\
10:09\
were held in his family home.\
10:11\
In February 1986, a petition\
was made for official government\
10:16\
recognition of the Church.\
10:18\
The signatures of three\
citizens of Zaire were required.\
10:23\
The three happy\
signatories of the petition\
10:27\
were Brother Banza, Sister\
Banza, and Brother Mbuyi.\
10:33\
These stalwart members knew\
the truth when they heard it;\
10:36\
they made a covenant\
at baptism that\
10:38\
anchored them to the Savior.\
10:40\
They metaphorically\
threw their old ways\
10:43\
into a churning waterfall\
with no intention\
10:46\
of retrieving them.\
10:47\
The covenant path\
was never easy.\
10:50\
Political turmoil, infrequent\
contact with Church leaders,\
10:54\
and challenges inherent in\
building a community of Saints\
10:58\
might have deterred\
less-committed individuals.\
11:01\
But Brother and Sister\
Banza and Brother Mbuyi\
11:04\
persevered in their faith.\
11:06\
They were present at the\
dedication of the Kinshasa\
11:08\
temple, 33 years\
after they signed\
11:11\
the petition that led\
to official recognition\
11:14\
of the Church in Zaire.\
11:17\
The Banzas are here in the\
Conference Center today.\
11:20\
They are accompanied by their\
two sons, Junior and Phil,\
11:23\
and daughters-in-law,\
Annie and Youyou.\
11:26\
In 1986, Junior and Phil were\
the first two individuals\
11:33\
baptized into the\
Church in Zaire.\
11:36\
Brother Mbuyi is watching\
these proceedings from Kinshasa\
11:40\
with his wife, Maguy,\
and their five children.\
11:44\
These pioneers understand\
the meaning and consequences\
11:47\
of covenants, through which\
they have been brought\
11:51\
"to the knowledge of\
the Lord their God,\
11:54\
and to rejoice in Jesus\
Christ their Redeemer."\
11:58\
How do we anchor\
ourselves to the Savior\
12:01\
and remain faithful\
like these and many tens\
12:05\
of thousands of Congolese\
Saints who followed them\
12:08\
and millions of others\
throughout the world?\
12:10\
The Savior taught us how.\
12:13\
Each week, we partake\
of the sacrament\
12:16\
and make a covenant with\
our Heavenly Father.\
12:19\
We promise to link our identity\
with the Savior's by pledging\
12:24\
our willingness to\
take upon us His name,\
12:26\
to always remember Him, and\
to keep His commandments.\
12:30\
Conscientiously preparing\
for and worthily\
12:34\
making these covenants each\
week anchors us to the Savior,\
12:39\
helps us internalize\
our commitment,\
12:42\
and powerfully propels us\
along the covenant path.\
12:47\
I invite you to commit\
to a lifelong process\
12:50\
of discipleship.\
12:51\
Make and keep covenants.\
12:54\
Throw your old ways into\
deep, churning waterfalls.\
12:59\
Completely bury your\
weapons of rebellion\
13:02\
with no handles sticking out.\
13:04\
Because of the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ,\
13:07\
making covenants with a real\
intent to reliably honor them\
13:12\
will bless your life forever.\
13:15\
You will become\
more like the Savior\
13:17\
as you always remember Him,\
follow Him, and adore Him.\
13:23\
I testify that He is\
the firm foundation.\
13:27\
He is dependable, and\
His promises are sure.\
13:31\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
