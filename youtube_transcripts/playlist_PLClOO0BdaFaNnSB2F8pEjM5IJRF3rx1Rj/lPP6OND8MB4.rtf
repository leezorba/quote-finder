My dear sisters, it is\
a joy to be with you!\
0:07\
We are witnessing an\
outpouring of revelation\
0:11\
that is both soul-stretching\
and exhilarating.\
0:16\
As we begin, I would like to\
introduce you to some friends;\
0:20\
they are young women unique in\
talent, custom, and individual\
0:26\
and family circumstance.\
0:28\
Each of them, like all of\
you, have captured my heart.\
0:34\
First, meet Bella.\
0:37\
She stands strong as\
the only young woman\
0:41\
in her branch in Iceland.\
0:43\
Meet devoted\
Josephine from Africa,\
0:47\
who has recommitted to studying\
the Book of Mormon every day.\
0:53\
She is discovering the power\
and the blessings that come\
0:58\
from this simple, faithful act.\
1:02\
And finally, meet my\
dear friend Ashtyn,\
1:07\
an extraordinary young\
woman who passed away\
1:12\
after a six-year\
battle with cancer.\
1:16\
Her testimony, her\
strong testimony,\
1:20\
of the Atonement of Jesus\
Christ still echoes in my heart.\
1:26\
You are all remarkable\
young women.\
1:29\
You are unique, each\
with your own gifts\
1:33\
and experiences yet alike in a\
very important and eternal way.\
1:40\
You are literally the spirit\
daughters of Heavenly Parents,\
1:45\
and nothing can separate\
you from Their love\
1:48\
and the love of your Savior.\
1:51\
As you draw closer to Him,\
even taking the smallest baby\
1:56\
steps forward, you will\
discover the lasting peace\
2:00\
that settles into your\
soul as a faithful disciple\
2:05\
of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
2:08\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
our dearly beloved prophet,\
2:13\
has asked that I share\
some inspired changes that\
2:17\
will help you "develop [your]\
sacred personal potential"\
2:21\
and increase your\
righteous influence.\
2:24\
I will address four areas\
of adjustments tonight.\
2:30\
First, at the heart of all we\
do in Young Women is our desire\
2:36\
to help you gain unshakable\
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ\
2:40\
and a sure knowledge\
of your divine identity\
2:43\
as a daughter of God.\
2:47\
Tonight I would like to announce\
a revision to the Young Women\
2:51\
theme.\
2:54\
I pray you will feel\
the Holy Ghost testify\
2:58\
the truth of these words\
as I say the new theme:\
3:05\
"I am a beloved daughter\
of heavenly parents,\
3:09\
with a divine nature\
and eternal destiny.\
3:14\
"As a disciple of Jesus Christ,\
I strive to become like Him.\
3:19\
I seek and act upon personal\
revelation and minister\
3:24\
to others in His holy name.\
3:27\
"I will stand as a witness\
of God at all times\
3:32\
and in all things\
and in all places.\
3:35\
"As I strive to\
qualify for exaltation,\
3:39\
I cherish the gift of repentance\
and seek to improve each day.\
3:46\
With faith, I will strengthen\
my home and family,\
3:50\
make and keep sacred\
covenants, and receive\
3:54\
the ordinances and blessings\
of the holy temple."\
4:00\
Notice the shift from\
we to I. These truths\
4:04\
apply to you individually.\
4:07\
You are beloved daughters\
of Heavenly Parents.\
4:10\
You are a covenant\
disciple of Jesus Christ.\
4:14\
I invite you to\
exercise your faith\
4:17\
and study and\
ponder these words.\
4:21\
I know as you do, you\
will gain a testimony\
4:25\
of their truthfulness.\
4:27\
Understanding these\
truths will change\
4:30\
the way you face challenges.\
4:33\
Knowing your identity and\
purpose will help you align\
4:36\
your will with the Savior's.\
4:39\
Peace and guidance will be yours\
as you follow Jesus Christ.\
4:44\
The second area of change\
affects Young Women classes.\
4:49\
Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, "So\
often what people need so much\
4:57\
is to be sheltered\
from the storms of life\
5:00\
in the sanctuary of belonging."\
5:02\
Our classes must be sanctuaries\
from the storms, secure places\
5:09\
of love and belonging.\
5:11\
In an effort to\
build greater unity,\
5:14\
strengthen friendships,\
and increase\
5:17\
that feeling of belonging\
within Young Women,\
5:20\
we are making some adjustments\
to class structure.\
5:24\
Did you know for over 100\
years, young women have been\
5:28\
divided into three classes?\
5:31\
Beginning immediately, we invite\
Young Women leaders and bishops\
5:36\
to prayerfully consider the\
needs of each young woman\
5:39\
and organize them\
according to the ward's\
5:42\
specific circumstances.\
5:44\
Now here are some examples\
of how this might look.\
5:49\
If you have few young\
women, you could\
5:51\
have one Young Women class\
with everyone meeting together.\
5:56\
Perhaps you have a large\
group of young women age 12\
6:00\
and then a small group of\
young women who are older.\
6:04\
You may decide to have\
two classes: Young Women\
6:08\
12 and Young Women 13-18.\
6:13\
Or you have a large ward with\
60 young women attending:\
6:18\
you may have six classes,\
one with each age,\
6:21\
organized by year.\
6:24\
However your classes\
are organized,\
6:26\
you young women are\
vital in building unity.\
6:29\
Be a light to those around you.\
6:33\
Be the source of\
love and care you are\
6:36\
hoping to receive from others.\
6:38\
With a prayer in your\
heart, continue to reach out\
6:42\
and be that force for good.\
6:44\
As you do so, your life will\
be filled with kindness.\
6:50\
You will have a better\
feeling towards others\
6:53\
and will begin to see\
their goodness in return.\
6:58\
Third, with this new\
class organization,\
7:01\
all classes will be\
referred to by the unifying\
7:06\
name of Young Women.\
7:09\
We will retire the names we have\
so loved: Beehive, Mia Maid,\
7:20\
and Laurel.\
7:25\
The final area I wish to\
address is the importance\
7:28\
of class presidencies.\
7:30\
No matter how Young Women\
classes are organized,\
7:34\
every class should have\
a class presidency!\
7:38\
It is by divine design\
that young women are\
7:42\
called to lead in their youth.\
7:45\
The role and purpose\
of class presidencies\
7:48\
has been strengthened\
and more clearly defined.\
7:51\
The work of salvation is\
one of these significant\
7:54\
responsibilities, particularly\
in the areas of ministering,\
7:59\
missionary work, activation, and\
temple and family history work.\
8:06\
Yes, this is how we gather\
Israel--a glorious work for all\
8:12\
young women as members of\
the Lord's youth battalion.\
8:18\
As you know, at every\
level of the Church,\
8:20\
the Lord calls presidencies\
to lead His people.\
8:23\
Young women, being a member\
of a class presidency\
8:26\
may be your first opportunity\
to participate in this inspired\
8:30\
pattern of leadership.\
8:32\
Adult leaders--this is for\
you--make the calling of class\
8:38\
presidencies a priority and then\
lead side by side with them,\
8:43\
mentoring and guiding\
them so they can succeed.\
8:47\
Whatever level of\
leadership experience\
8:50\
a class presidency has,\
start where they are\
8:55\
and help them develop the\
skills and confidence that\
8:58\
will bless them as leaders.\
9:01\
Stay close to them,\
but don't take over.\
9:05\
The Spirit will guide\
you as you guide them.\
9:09\
To illustrate the vital role of\
parents and leaders as mentors,\
9:14\
let me tell you a story.\
9:15\
Chloe was called to serve\
as a class president.\
9:19\
Her wise priesthood\
leader encouraged\
9:21\
her to seek the Lord's\
help in recommending names\
9:25\
for her presidency.\
9:26\
Chloe prayed and\
received inspiration\
9:30\
for whom to recommend as her\
counselors rather quickly.\
9:34\
As she continued to ponder\
and pray about a secretary,\
9:38\
the Spirit repeatedly drew her\
focus to a young woman that\
9:42\
surprised her--someone\
who rarely came to church\
9:46\
or activities.\
9:48\
Feeling a little insecure\
with the prompting,\
9:51\
Chloe talked with\
her mother, who\
9:54\
explained that one of the\
ways we can receive revelation\
9:58\
is through reoccurring thoughts.\
10:01\
With renewed\
confidence, Chloe felt\
10:04\
she could recommend\
this young woman.\
10:07\
The bishop extended the call,\
and the young woman accepted.\
10:11\
After being set apart,\
this sweet secretary\
10:16\
said, "You know, I've never\
felt as though I had a place\
10:22\
or was needed anywhere.\
10:24\
I didn't feel ...\
10:25\
I fit in.\
10:27\
But with this calling, I feel\
as though Heavenly Father has\
10:31\
a purpose and a place for me."\
10:34\
As Chloe and her mother\
left the meeting,\
10:38\
Chloe turned to her mother and\
said with tears in her eyes,\
10:44\
"Revelation is real!\
10:46\
Revelation really works!"\
10:50\
Class presidencies, you\
have been called of God\
10:53\
and trusted to lead a\
group of His daughters.\
10:55\
"The Lord knows you. ...\
10:57\
He chose you."\
10:59\
You have been set apart by one\
who has priesthood authority;\
11:05\
this means, as you perform\
the duties of your calling,\
11:08\
you exercise\
priesthood authority.\
11:11\
You have an\
important work to do.\
11:13\
Be sensitive to and act on the\
promptings of the Holy Ghost.\
11:17\
As you do so, you can\
serve with confidence,\
11:22\
for you do not serve alone!\
11:25\
Class presidents, we\
need your wisdom, voice,\
11:28\
and energy in the new\
ward youth council\
11:32\
that Elder Quentin L.\
Cook announced today.\
11:35\
You are an essential\
part of the solution\
11:38\
to the meeting the needs of\
your brothers and sisters.\
11:42\
These changes in class\
organization and leadership\
11:46\
may begin as soon as wards and\
branches are ready but should\
11:51\
be in place by January 1, 2020.\
11:56\
My dear sisters, I bear\
witness that these adjustments\
12:04\
I have spoken of today\
are inspired direction\
12:07\
from the Lord.\
12:08\
As we diligently implement\
these adjustments, may\
12:13\
we never lose sight\
of our purpose:\
12:16\
to strengthen our resolve\
to follow Jesus Christ\
12:20\
and help others come unto Him.\
12:23\
I testify that\
this is His Church.\
12:27\
How grateful I am\
that He allows us\
12:30\
to be a very important\
part of this sacred work.\
12:34\
I pray that the same Spirit that\
has guided these adjustments\
12:38\
will guide you as you press\
forward on the covenant path.\
12:42\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
