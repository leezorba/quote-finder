Roughly two thousand\
years ago, the Savior\
0:05\
came down from the mountain\
after teaching the Beatitudes\
0:08\
and other gospel principles.\
0:11\
As He walked, He was approached\
by a man sick with leprosy.\
0:15\
The man showed\
reverence and respect\
0:18\
as he knelt before\
Christ, seeking relief\
0:22\
from his affliction.\
0:23\
His request was simple:\
"Lord, if thou wilt,\
0:28\
thou canst make me clean."\
0:31\
The Savior then extended\
His hand and, touching him,\
0:34\
said, "I will; be thou clean."\
0:39\
We learn here that our Savior\
always wants to bless us.\
0:44\
Some blessings may\
come immediately,\
0:46\
others may take longer, and some\
may even come after this life,\
0:51\
but blessings will\
come in due time.\
0:55\
Much like the leper, we can\
find strength and comfort\
0:59\
in this life by\
accepting His will\
1:02\
and knowing that He\
wants to bless us.\
1:05\
We can find the strength\
to face any challenge,\
1:08\
to overcome temptations,\
and to understand and endure\
1:12\
our difficult circumstances.\
1:15\
Surely, in the most\
crushing moment of His life,\
1:20\
the Savior's strength\
to endure was\
1:22\
deepened as He said to His\
Father, "Thy will be done."\
1:28\
The leper did not make his\
request in a pretentious\
1:31\
or demanding manner.\
1:32\
His words reveal a humble\
attitude with high expectations\
1:37\
but also with a sincere desire\
that the will of the Savior\
1:42\
be done.\
1:43\
This is an example of the\
attitude with which we\
1:49\
should come unto Christ.\
1:50\
We can come unto Christ\
with the certainty\
1:54\
that His desire currently\
is and always will\
1:58\
be the best for our\
mortal and eternal lives.\
2:02\
He has an eternal perspective\
that we do not always have.\
2:07\
We must come unto Christ\
with a sincere desire\
2:13\
that our will be swallowed up\
in His, which will prepare us\
2:18\
for eternal life.\
2:20\
It is very hard to imagine\
the physical and emotional\
2:24\
suffering that weighed on the\
leper who came unto the Savior.\
2:30\
Leprosy affects the nerves and\
skin, causing disfigurement\
2:34\
and disability.\
2:35\
Additionally, it led\
to great social stigma.\
2:39\
Someone stricken with leprosy\
had to leave their loved ones\
2:44\
and live isolated from society.\
2:47\
Lepers were considered\
unclean both physically\
2:51\
and spiritually.\
2:52\
For this reason,\
the law of Moses\
2:56\
required that lepers\
wear torn clothing\
2:58\
and call out, "Unclean!"\
3:00\
as they walked.\
3:02\
Sick and despised,\
lepers ended up living\
3:05\
in abandoned houses or tombs.\
3:07\
It is not hard to imagine\
that the leper who approached\
3:11\
the Savior was broken.\
3:14\
In one way or another,\
we too can feel broken,\
3:18\
whether due to our own\
actions or those of others,\
3:21\
due to circumstances we\
can or cannot control.\
3:25\
In such moments, we can\
place our will in His hands.\
3:32\
Some years ago, Zulma, my wife,\
my better half, my best part,\
3:37\
received some difficult news.\
3:39\
She had a cyst in\
her parotid gland,\
3:43\
and it was growing rapidly.\
3:44\
Her face began swelling, and\
she was to immediately undergo\
3:49\
a delicate operation.\
3:51\
Many thoughts ran through her\
mind and weighed on her heart.\
3:55\
Was the tumor malignant?\
3:57\
How would her body recover?\
4:00\
Would her face become paralyzed?\
4:03\
How intense would the pain be?\
4:05\
Would her face be\
permanently scarred?\
4:08\
Would the tumor\
return once removed?\
4:13\
Even if she could attend the\
wedding of one of our sons\
4:17\
that was going to take\
place two weeks later.\
4:21\
As she lay in the operating\
room, she felt broken.\
4:26\
In that very important\
moment, the Spirit\
4:29\
whispered to her that she had\
to accept the will of the Lord.\
4:33\
Then she decided to\
place her trust in God.\
4:37\
She felt strongly that\
whatever the result,\
4:40\
His will would be\
the best for her.\
4:43\
Soon she drifted\
into surgical sleep.\
4:48\
Later, she wrote\
poetically in her diary:\
4:51\
"On the surgeon's table\
I bowed before Thee,\
4:55\
and surrendering to Thy\
will, I fell asleep.\
4:59\
I knew I could turn to Thee,\
knowing that nothing bad can\
5:04\
come from Thee."\
5:06\
She found strength and comfort\
from surrendering her will\
5:10\
to that of the Father.\
5:11\
That day God\
blessed her greatly.\
5:16\
Whatever our\
circumstances might be,\
5:19\
we can exercise our\
faith to come unto Christ\
5:22\
and find a God we can trust.\
5:25\
As my son once wrote:\
5:29\
"According to the prophet, God's\
face is brighter than the sun\
5:33\
and His long hair\
is whiter than snow\
5:36\
and His voice roars like\
the rushing of a river,\
5:40\
and next to Him man is nothing.\
5:43\
...\
5:45\
I am crushed as I realize\
that even I am nothing.\
5:49\
And only then do I fumble\
my way to a god I can trust.\
5:54\
And only then do I discover\
the God I can trust."\
5:59\
We can trust Him because He\
loves us and wants what is best\
6:03\
for us in every circumstance.\
6:07\
The leper came forward\
because of the power of hope.\
6:11\
And hope is emboldened by\
a god that we can trust.\
6:16\
The world gave him no\
solutions, not even comfort.\
6:20\
Thus, the Savior's\
simple touch must\
6:23\
have felt like a caress\
unto his entire soul.\
6:27\
We can only imagine the\
deep feelings of gratitude\
6:31\
the leper must have had\
at the Savior's touch,\
6:35\
especially when he heard the\
words "I will; be thou clean."\
6:42\
The story states that\
"immediately his leprosy\
6:45\
was cleansed."\
6:47\
We too can feel the touch of the\
Savior's loving, healing hand.\
6:51\
What joy, hope, and\
gratefulness comes to our souls\
6:55\
in knowing that He wants\
to help us to be clean!\
7:00\
As we come unto Him, God\
will come to our rescue,\
7:04\
whether to heal us or\
to give us the strength\
7:07\
to face any situation.\
7:11\
At any rate, accepting His\
will--not our own--will help us\
7:16\
understand our circumstances.\
7:18\
Nothing bad can come from God.\
7:21\
He knows what is\
the best for us.\
7:24\
Perhaps He will not remove\
our burdens right away.\
7:28\
Sometimes He can make those\
burdens feel lighter, as He\
7:32\
did with Alma and his people.\
7:34\
Ultimately, because of\
covenants, the burdens\
7:38\
will be lifted,\
either in this life\
7:41\
or at the holy Resurrection.\
7:45\
A sincere desire that\
His will be done,\
7:47\
along with an understanding of\
our Redeemer's divine nature,\
7:52\
helps us develop\
the kind of faith\
7:55\
that the leper showed\
in order to be cleansed.\
7:59\
Jesus Christ is a God of love,\
a God of hope, a God of healing,\
8:05\
a God who wants to bless\
us and help us be clean.\
8:09\
That is what He wanted before\
coming to this earth, when\
8:13\
He volunteered to rescue us\
when we fall into transgression.\
8:18\
That is what He\
wanted in Gethsemane,\
8:20\
when He faced humanly\
incomprehensible\
8:23\
pain during the agony of\
paying the price of sin.\
8:27\
That is what He wants now,\
when He pleads on our behalf\
8:33\
before the Father.\
8:35\
That is why His voice\
echoes still: "Come unto me,\
8:41\
all ye that labour\
and are heavy laden,\
8:44\
and I will give you rest."\
8:48\
He can heal us and lift us\
up because He has the ability\
8:53\
to do it.\
8:54\
He took upon Himself all\
the pains of body and spirit\
8:58\
so that His bowels would be\
filled with mercy in order\
9:02\
to be able to help\
us in all things\
9:05\
and to heal us and lift us up.\
9:09\
The words of Isaiah,\
as cited by Abinadi,\
9:14\
put it beautifully and movingly:\
9:17\
"Surely he has borne our\
griefs, and carried our sorrows.\
9:21\
...\
9:22\
"...\
9:22\
He was wounded for\
our transgressions,\
9:25\
he was bruised for\
our iniquities;\
9:28\
the chastisement of\
our peace was upon him;\
9:31\
and with his stripes\
we are healed."\
9:33\
A similar concept is\
taught in this poem:\
9:39\
"'O Carpenter of Nazareth,\
9:41\
This heart, that's\
broken past repair,\
9:44\
This life, that's\
shattered nigh to death,\
9:48\
Oh, can You mend\
them, Carpenter?'\
9:51\
And by His kind and ready hand,\
9:54\
His own sweet life\
is woven through\
9:57\
Our broken lives,\
until they stand\
10:00\
A New Creation--'all\
things new.'\
10:04\
'The shattered [substance]\
of [the] heart,\
10:07\
Desire, ambition,\
hope, and faith,\
10:10\
Mould Thou into\
... perfect part,\
10:12\
O, Carpenter of Nazareth!'"\
10:16\
If you feel that in any\
way you are not clean,\
10:19\
if you feel broken, please\
know you can be made clean,\
10:25\
you can be mended,\
because He loves you.\
10:29\
Trust that nothing\
bad can come from Him.\
10:33\
Because He "descended\
below all things,"\
10:36\
He makes it possible\
for all things that\
10:39\
have been broken in\
our lives to be mended,\
10:42\
and thus we can be\
reconciled with God.\
10:46\
Through Him all things are\
reconciled, both things\
10:51\
that are on the earth and\
things that are in heaven,\
10:53\
making "peace through\
the blood of his cross."\
10:58\
Let us come unto Christ,\
taking all necessary steps.\
11:02\
As we do, may our\
attitude be one of saying,\
11:06\
"Lord, if thou wilt, thou\
canst make me clean."\
11:10\
If we do so, we can receive\
the Master's healing\
11:16\
touch alongside the\
sweet echo of His voice:\
11:20\
"I will; be thou clean."\
11:23\
The Savior is a\
God we can trust.\
11:26\
He is the Christ, the Anointed\
One, the Messiah of whom\
11:31\
I testify in His holy name,\
even Jesus Christ, amen.\
