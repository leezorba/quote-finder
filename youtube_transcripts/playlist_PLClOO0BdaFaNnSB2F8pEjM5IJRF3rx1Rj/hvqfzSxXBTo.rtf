Somewhat hidden in the Old\
Testament book of Haggai\
0:03\
is a description of a group\
of people who could have\
0:06\
used Elder Holland's counsel.\
0:08\
They got it wrong by\
not placing Christ\
0:11\
at the center of their\
lives and their service.\
0:14\
Haggai paints some\
thought-provoking word pictures\
0:18\
as he reprimands these\
people for staying\
0:20\
in their comfortable houses\
instead of building the Lord's\
0:23\
temple:\
0:26\
"Is it time for you, O ye, to\
dwell in your ceiled houses,\
0:29\
and this house lie waste?\
0:31\
"Now therefore thus\
saith the Lord of hosts;\
0:34\
Consider your ways.\
0:37\
"Ye have sown much,\
and bring in little;\
0:39\
ye eat, but ye have\
not enough; ye drink,\
0:43\
but ye are not filled\
with drink; ye clothe you,\
0:47\
but there is none warm;\
and he that earneth wages\
0:51\
earneth wages to put it\
into a bag with holes.\
0:56\
"Thus saith the Lord of\
hosts; Consider your ways."\
1:00\
Don't you love\
those descriptions\
1:02\
of the futility of\
prioritizing things\
1:05\
of no eternal consequence\
above the things of God?\
1:09\
In a recent sacrament\
meeting I attended,\
1:11\
a returned missionary quoted\
a father who summed up\
1:14\
this idea perfectly when\
he said to his children,\
1:17\
"What we need here is less\
Wi-Fi and more Nephi!"\
1:21\
[LAUGHTER]\
1:24\
Having lived in West\
Africa for five years,\
1:27\
I saw plenty of\
examples of people\
1:29\
prioritizing the gospel\
naturally and unashamedly.\
1:32\
One such example is the\
name of a tire repair\
1:36\
and wheel-balancing\
business in Ghana.\
1:38\
The owner has named it\
"Thy Will Alignment."\
1:44\
We can feel enduring joy when\
our Savior and His gospel\
1:49\
become the framework around\
which we build our lives.\
1:52\
However, it's so easy\
for that framework\
1:55\
to become, instead, the\
things of the world,\
1:57\
where the gospel sits\
as an optional extra,\
2:00\
or as simply attending church\
for two hours on Sundays.\
2:04\
When this is the case, it is\
tantamount to putting our wages\
2:08\
into "a bag with holes."\
2:11\
Haggai is telling us\
to be committed--to be,\
2:13\
as we say in Australia,\
"fair dinkum"\
2:16\
about living the gospel.\
2:18\
People are fair dinkum when\
they are what they say they are.\
2:22\
I learned a little\
about being fair dinkum\
2:24\
and being committed\
by playing rugby.\
2:27\
I learned that when I played\
my hardest, when I gave my all,\
2:31\
my enjoyment of the\
game was greatest.\
2:34\
My favorite year of rugby was\
the year after high school.\
2:37\
The team of which\
I was a member was\
2:39\
both talented and committed.\
2:41\
We were the champion\
team that year.\
2:43\
However, one day we were to\
play a lowly ranked team,\
2:47\
and after the game,\
we all had dates\
2:49\
to take to the big,\
annual college dance.\
2:52\
I thought that because\
this would be an easy game,\
2:55\
I should try to protect myself\
from injury so I would be\
2:57\
able to enjoy the dance fully.\
2:59\
In that game, we were not as\
committed in the hard contacts\
3:03\
as we might have\
been, and we lost.\
3:05\
To make things worse,\
I ended the match\
3:08\
with a very swollen, fat\
lip that did not enhance\
3:12\
my appearance for my big date.\
3:14\
Perhaps I needed\
to learn something.\
3:18\
A very different\
experience occurred\
3:19\
in a later game in which\
I was totally committed.\
3:23\
At one point I ran with\
real intent into a contact;\
3:26\
immediately, I felt\
some pain in my face.\
3:29\
Having been taught by my\
father that I should never\
3:31\
let the opposition\
know if I was hurt,\
3:34\
I continued to\
play out the game.\
3:36\
That night, while trying to eat,\
I found that I couldn't bite.\
3:40\
The next morning, I\
went to the hospital,\
3:42\
where an X-ray confirmed\
that my jaw was broken.\
3:45\
My mouth was wired shut\
for the next six weeks.\
3:49\
Lessons were learned from\
this parable of the fat lip\
3:52\
and the broken jaw.\
3:55\
Despite my memories of\
unsatisfied cravings\
3:58\
for solid food\
during the six weeks\
4:01\
when I could ingest\
only liquids,\
4:03\
I feel no regrets\
about my broken jaw\
4:06\
because it resulted\
from my giving my all.\
4:09\
But I do have regrets\
about the fat lip\
4:12\
because it symbolized\
my holding back.\
4:16\
Giving our all\
doesn't mean that we\
4:18\
will be continually\
enveloped in blessings\
4:20\
or always have success.\
4:22\
But it does mean that\
we will have joy.\
4:26\
Joy is not fleeting pleasure\
or even temporary happiness.\
4:31\
Joy is enduring and is\
founded on our efforts being\
4:35\
accepted by the Lord.\
4:37\
An example of such acceptance\
is the story of Oliver Granger.\
4:41\
As President Boyd\
K. Packer stated:\
4:43\
"When the saints were\
driven from Kirtland, ...\
4:46\
Oliver was left behind\
to sell their properties\
4:48\
for what little he could.\
4:50\
There was not much chance\
that he could succeed.\
4:52\
And, really, he\
did not succeed!"\
4:55\
He had been commissioned\
by the First Presidency\
4:57\
to do a task that was\
difficult, if not impossible.\
5:01\
But the Lord commended him for\
his apparently unsuccessful\
5:05\
efforts in these words:\
5:07\
"I remember my servant\
Oliver Granger;\
5:10\
behold, verily I say unto\
him that his name shall\
5:14\
be had in sacred remembrance\
from generation to generation,\
5:18\
forever and ever,\
saith the Lord.\
5:21\
"Therefore, let him contend\
earnestly for the redemption\
5:24\
of the First Presidency\
of my Church, ...\
5:26\
and when he falls\
he shall rise again,\
5:30\
for his sacrifice shall be\
more sacred unto me than his\
5:33\
increase, saith the Lord."\
5:36\
That may be true of all of\
us--it's not our successes\
5:40\
but rather our sacrifice\
and efforts that matter\
5:43\
to the Lord.\
5:45\
Another example of a true\
disciple of Jesus Christ\
5:48\
is a dear friend of ours in\
Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa.\
5:51\
This wonderful, faithful sister\
suffered terrible emotional\
5:56\
and even some physical\
abuse from her husband\
5:59\
over a sustained period of time,\
and eventually they divorced.\
6:03\
She never wavered in\
her faith and goodness,\
6:07\
but because of his\
cruelty to her,\
6:09\
she was deeply hurt\
for a long time.\
6:12\
In her own words, she\
describes what happened:\
6:16\
"Though I said I forgave him,\
I always slept with a wound;\
6:20\
I spent my days with that wound.\
6:22\
It was like a burn in my heart.\
6:24\
Many times I prayed to the\
Lord to take it away from me,\
6:28\
but it hurt so bad\
that I strongly\
6:31\
believed I was going to spend\
the rest of my life with it.\
6:34\
It hurt more than when I\
lost my mom at a young age;\
6:38\
it hurt more than when I\
lost my dad and even my son.\
6:42\
It seemed to expand\
and cover my heart,\
6:45\
giving me the impression I was\
going to even die at any time.\
6:50\
"Some other times I asked myself\
what the Savior would have done\
6:53\
in my situation, and I would\
rather say, 'This is too much,\
6:58\
Lord.'\
7:00\
"Then one morning I\
looked for the pain that\
7:03\
comes from all this in\
my heart and went deeper,\
7:06\
looking for it in my soul.\
7:08\
It was nowhere to be found.\
7:11\
My mind quickly passed to\
review all the reasons I\
7:15\
[had] to feel hurt, but\
I did not feel the pain.\
7:18\
I waited the whole\
day to see if I\
7:20\
was going to feel the pain in\
my heart; I did not feel it.\
7:25\
Then I knelt down\
and thanked God\
7:28\
for making the atoning sacrifice\
of the Lord work for me."\
7:33\
This sister is\
now happily sealed\
7:37\
to a wonderful, faithful\
man who loves her deeply.\
7:42\
So what should our\
attitude be if we\
7:44\
are true disciples of Christ?\
7:47\
And what is the\
gospel worth to us\
7:49\
when we do "consider [our]\
ways," as Haggai suggested?\
7:53\
I love the example shown\
by King Lamoni's father.\
7:57\
You'll remember his initial\
anger at finding his son being\
8:01\
accompanied by Ammon, a\
Nephite--a people whom\
8:04\
the Lamanites hated.\
8:06\
He drew his sword to\
contend with Ammon\
8:08\
and soon found Ammon's\
sword at his own throat.\
8:11\
"Now the king, fearing\
he should lose his life,\
8:14\
said: If thou wilt spare\
me I will grant unto thee\
8:17\
whatsoever thou wilt ask,\
even to half of the kingdom."\
8:22\
Note his offer--half his\
kingdom for his life.\
8:26\
But later, after\
understanding the gospel,\
8:29\
he made another offer.\
8:30\
"The king said: What\
shall I do that I\
8:32\
may have this eternal life\
of which thou hast spoken?\
8:36\
Yea, what shall I do that I\
may be born of God, having\
8:40\
this wicked spirit\
rooted out of my breast,\
8:42\
and receive his Spirit, that\
I may be filled with joy,\
8:47\
that I may not be cast\
off at the last day?\
8:50\
Behold, said he, I will give\
up all that I possess, yea,\
8:55\
I will forsake my kingdom, that\
I may receive this great joy."\
9:00\
This time, he was prepared\
to give up all his kingdom\
9:04\
because the gospel was\
worth more than all he had!\
9:08\
He was fair dinkum\
about the gospel.\
9:11\
So, the question for each of\
us is Are we also fair dinkum\
9:14\
about the gospel?\
9:16\
Because being half-hearted\
is not being fair dinkum!\
9:20\
And God is not known\
for showering praise\
9:23\
on the lukewarm.\
9:25\
There is no treasure, nor\
any hobby, nor any status,\
9:28\
nor any social media, nor any\
video games, nor any sport,\
9:32\
nor any association\
with a celebrity,\
9:35\
nor anything on\
earth that is more\
9:38\
precious than eternal life.\
9:41\
So the Lord's counsel to every\
person is "consider your ways."\
9:47\
My feelings are best expressed\
in the words of Nephi:\
9:51\
"I glory in plainness; I glory\
in truth; I glory in my Jesus,\
9:57\
for he hath redeemed\
my soul from hell."\
10:01\
Are we true followers of\
Him who gave His all for us?\
10:04\
He who is our Redeemer and\
our Advocate with the Father?\
10:08\
He who was Himself\
absolutely committed\
10:11\
in His atoning\
sacrifice and is so now\
10:14\
in His love, His mercy,\
and His desire for us\
10:18\
to have eternal joy?\
10:20\
I plead with all who hear\
and read these words:\
10:24\
Please, please don't put\
your total commitment off\
10:27\
until you get around to it at\
some nonexistent future time.\
10:31\
Get fair dinkum now\
and feel the joy!\
10:35\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
