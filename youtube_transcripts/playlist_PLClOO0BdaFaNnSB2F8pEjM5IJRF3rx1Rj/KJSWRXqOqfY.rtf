We rejoice in\
meeting together in\
0:03\
this great general conference\
of The Church of Jesus\
0:06\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
0:08\
It is a blessing to receive\
the mind and will of the Lord\
0:11\
through the teachings of\
His prophets and apostles.\
0:14\
President Russell M. Nelson\
is the Lord's living prophet.\
0:18\
And how grateful we are for his\
inspired counsel and direction\
0:21\
we have received today.\
0:24\
I add my witness to\
those shared previously.\
0:26\
I bear testimony of\
God, our Eternal Father.\
0:29\
He lives and loves us\
and watches over us.\
0:32\
His plan of happiness\
provides for the blessing\
0:35\
of this mortal life\
and our eventual return\
0:37\
to His presence.\
0:39\
I also bear testimony\
of Jesus Christ.\
0:42\
He is God's Only Begotten Son.\
0:44\
He saved us from death,\
and He redeems us from sin\
0:48\
as we exercise faith\
in Him and repent.\
0:52\
His infinite atoning\
sacrifice in our behalf\
0:56\
brings the blessing of\
immortality and eternal life.\
0:59\
Indeed, "God be thanked\
for the matchless gift\
1:03\
of His divine son."\
1:05\
Latter-day Saints\
around the world\
1:07\
are blessed to worship\
Jesus Christ in His temples.\
1:10\
One of those\
temples is currently\
1:11\
under construction\
in Winnipeg, Canada.\
1:14\
My wife, Anne Marie, and\
I had the opportunity\
1:16\
to visit the construction\
site in August of this year.\
1:20\
The temple is\
beautifully designed\
1:22\
and will certainly be\
magnificent when completed.\
1:25\
However, you can't have\
a magnificent temple\
1:28\
in Winnipeg, or anywhere\
else, without a solid and firm\
1:32\
foundation.\
1:34\
The freeze-thaw cycle and\
expansive soil conditions\
1:37\
in Winnipeg made it challenging\
to prepare the temple\
1:40\
foundation.\
1:42\
Therefore, it was determined\
that the foundation\
1:44\
for this temple would consist\
of 70 steel piles encased\
1:49\
in concrete.\
1:50\
These piles are\
60 feet in length\
1:52\
and 12 to 20 inches in diameter.\
1:55\
They are driven into the\
ground until they hit bedrock,\
1:58\
approximately 50 feet\
below the surface.\
2:00\
In this way, the\
70 piles provide\
2:03\
a solid, firm\
foundation for what\
2:06\
will be the beautiful\
Winnipeg temple.\
2:09\
As Latter-day Saints, we\
seek a similar firm and sure\
2:13\
foundation in our lives--a\
spiritual foundation needed\
2:17\
for our journey through\
mortality and back\
2:20\
to our heavenly home.\
2:21\
That foundation is\
established on the bedrock\
2:24\
of our conversion to\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
2:28\
We recall the teachings\
of Helaman from the Book\
2:30\
of Mormon: "And now,\
my sons, remember,\
2:34\
remember that it is upon\
the rock of our Redeemer,\
2:37\
who is Christ, the Son of\
God, that ye must build\
2:39\
your foundation; that when\
the devil shall send forth his\
2:43\
mighty winds, yea, his\
shafts in the whirlwind, ...\
2:47\
it shall have no power over you\
to drag you down to the gulf\
2:51\
of misery and endless wo,\
because of the rock upon which\
2:54\
ye are built, which\
is a sure foundation,\
2:58\
a foundation whereon if men\
build they cannot fall."\
3:03\
Gratefully, we live in a time\
when prophets and apostles\
3:06\
teach us of the\
Savior Jesus Christ.\
3:09\
Following their counsel helps\
us establish a firm foundation\
3:13\
in Christ.\
3:15\
A year ago, in his\
opening remarks\
3:17\
of the 2018 general conference,\
President Russell M. Nelson\
3:23\
provided this\
declaration and warning:\
3:26\
"The long-standing\
objective of the Church\
3:29\
is to assist all\
members to increase\
3:31\
their faith in our Lord Jesus\
Christ and in His Atonement,\
3:35\
to assist them in\
making and keeping\
3:38\
their covenants with God,\
and to strengthen and seal\
3:41\
their families.\
3:42\
In this complex world\
today, this is not easy.\
3:47\
The adversary is\
increasing his attacks\
3:51\
on faith and upon\
us and our families\
3:53\
at an exponential rate.\
3:55\
To survive spiritually, we need\
counterstrategies and proactive\
4:01\
plans."\
4:03\
Following President\
Nelson's message,\
4:04\
Elder Quentin L. Cook of the\
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles\
4:07\
introduced the Come,\
Follow Me resource\
4:10\
for individuals and families.\
4:12\
His remarks included the\
following statements:\
4:15\
"The new home-study Come,\
Follow Me resource ...\
4:19\
is designed to help members\
learn the gospel in the home."\
4:22\
"This resource is for\
every individual and family\
4:25\
in the Church."\
4:27\
"Our purpose is to balance the\
Church and the home experience\
4:30\
... in a way that will greatly\
increase faith and spirituality\
4:34\
and deepen conversion to\
Heavenly Father and the Lord\
4:37\
Jesus Christ."\
4:39\
Starting in January\
of this year,\
4:41\
Latter-day Saints\
worldwide began\
4:42\
studying the New\
Testament, with the Come,\
4:44\
Follow Me resource as our guide.\
4:47\
With a weekly schedule,\
Come, Follow Me\
4:50\
helps us study the scriptures,\
the doctrine of the gospel,\
4:53\
and the teachings of the\
prophets and apostles.\
4:56\
It is a marvelous\
resource for us all.\
4:59\
After nine months of this\
worldwide scripture study\
5:02\
effort, what do we see?\
5:04\
We see Latter-day Saints\
everywhere growing\
5:07\
in faith and devotion to\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
5:10\
We see individuals and\
families setting aside time\
5:13\
throughout the week to study\
the words of our Savior.\
5:17\
We see improving gospel\
instruction in our Sunday\
5:20\
classes as we study\
the scriptures at home\
5:23\
and share our\
insights at church.\
5:26\
And we see greater\
family joy and unity\
5:29\
as we have moved\
from simply reading\
5:31\
the scriptures to studying the\
scriptures in a profound way.\
5:36\
It has been my privilege to\
visit with many Latter-day\
5:39\
Saints and hear firsthand\
of their experiences\
5:42\
with Come, Follow Me.\
5:43\
Their expressions of faith\
fill my heart with joy.\
5:47\
Here are just a\
few of the comments\
5:49\
I have heard from various\
members of the Church\
5:52\
in different parts of the world:\
5:54\
A father shared, "I\
enjoy Come, Follow Me\
5:57\
as it provides an opportunity\
to testify of the Savior\
6:01\
to my children."\
6:03\
In another home, a\
child said, "This\
6:05\
is a chance to hear my parents\
bear their testimonies."\
6:09\
A MOTHER SHARED: "We\
have been inspired\
6:11\
as to how to put God first.\
6:13\
The time we [thought\
we] 'didn't have'\
6:15\
has been [filled] with hope,\
joy, peace, and success in ways\
6:20\
we didn't know were possible."\
6:24\
A COUPLE OBSERVED: "We\
are reading the scriptures\
6:26\
entirely differently than we\
have ever read them before.\
6:29\
We are learning so much\
more than we have ever\
6:31\
learned before.\
6:32\
The Lord is wanting us to\
see things differently.\
6:36\
The Lord is preparing us."\
6:40\
A MOTHER REMARKED: "I love that\
we are learning the same things\
6:43\
together.\
6:44\
Before, we were reading it.\
6:45\
Today, we are learning it."\
6:48\
A sister shared this\
insightful perspective:\
6:51\
"Before, you had the lesson and\
the scriptures supplemented it.\
6:55\
Now, you have the scriptures\
and the lesson supplements it."\
7:01\
ANOTHER SISTER COMMENTED: "I\
feel a difference when I do it\
7:03\
[compared to] when I don't.\
7:05\
I find it [is] easier\
to talk to others\
7:07\
about Jesus Christ\
and our beliefs."\
7:11\
A grandmother remarked, "I call\
my children and grandchildren\
7:14\
on Sundays, and we share\
insights from Come,\
7:17\
Follow Me together."\
7:20\
A SISTER OBSERVED: "Come, Follow\
Me feels like the Savior is\
7:24\
personally ministering to me.\
7:26\
It is heaven inspired."\
7:29\
And a father commented,\
"[When] we use Come, Follow Me,\
7:33\
we are like the\
children of Israel,\
7:35\
marking the side\
posts of our doors,\
7:37\
protecting our families from\
the influence of the destroyer."\
7:41\
Brothers and sisters, it\
is a joy to visit with you\
7:44\
and to hear how your\
efforts with Come, Follow Me\
7:46\
are blessing your lives.\
7:47\
Thank you for your devotion.\
7:51\
Studying the scriptures with\
Come, Follow Me as a guide\
7:53\
is strengthening our conversion\
to Jesus Christ and His gospel.\
7:57\
We are not simply trading\
one hour less in church\
8:00\
on Sunday for one hour more\
of scripture study at home.\
8:04\
Learning the gospel\
is a consistent effort\
8:06\
throughout the week.\
8:08\
As one sister\
insightfully shared,\
8:11\
"The goal is not to make\
church one hour shorter;\
8:15\
it is to make church\
six days longer!"\
8:19\
Now, consider again the warning\
our prophet, President Nelson,\
8:25\
gave as he opened the October\
2018 general conference:\
8:30\
"The adversary is\
increasing his attacks\
8:32\
on faith and upon\
us and our families\
8:36\
at an exponential rate.\
8:38\
To survive spiritually, we need\
counterstrategies and proactive\
8:41\
plans."\
8:42\
Then (approximately 29 hours\
later) on Sunday afternoon,\
8:46\
he closed the conference\
with this promise:\
8:49\
"As you diligently work to\
remodel your home into a center\
8:52\
of gospel learning, ... the\
influence of the adversary\
8:56\
in your life and in your\
home will decrease."\
9:00\
How can the attacks\
of the adversary\
9:02\
be increasing exponentially\
while at the same time\
9:04\
the influence of the adversary\
is actually decreasing?\
9:08\
It can happen, and\
it is happening\
9:11\
throughout the Church,\
because the Lord prepares\
9:14\
His people against the\
attacks of the adversary.\
9:17\
Come, Follow Me is the Lord's\
counterstrategy and proactive\
9:22\
plan.\
9:23\
As President Nelson taught,\
"The new home-centered,\
9:27\
Church-supported integrated\
curriculum has the potential\
9:30\
to unleash the\
power[s] of families."\
9:33\
However, it does and will\
require our best efforts;\
9:36\
we need to "[follow] through\
conscientiously and carefully\
9:39\
to transform [our] home\
into a sanctuary of faith."\
9:43\
After all, as President\
Nelson also said,\
9:46\
"We are each responsible for\
our individual ... growth."\
9:51\
With the Come,\
Follow Me resource,\
9:52\
the Lord is preparing us "for\
the perilous times that we now\
9:56\
face."\
9:57\
He is helping us establish\
that "sure foundation,\
10:00\
a foundation whereon if men\
build they cannot fall"--the\
10:04\
foundation of a testimony\
anchored firmly in the bedrock\
10:08\
of our conversion to\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
10:12\
May our daily\
efforts in studying\
10:14\
the scriptures fortify\
us and prove us\
10:17\
worthy of these\
promised blessings.\
10:20\
I so pray in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
