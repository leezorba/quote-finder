Dear brothers and\
sisters, we have\
0:03\
received wonderful\
teachings from our leaders\
0:06\
during these last two days.\
0:08\
I testify to you\
that if we strive\
0:12\
to apply these inspired and\
timely teachings in our lives,\
0:15\
the Lord, through His\
grace, will help each of us\
0:19\
carry our cross and\
make our burdens light.\
0:24\
While in the vicinity\
of Caesarea Philippi,\
0:27\
the Savior revealed\
to His disciples\
0:30\
what He would\
suffer at the hands\
0:32\
of the elders, chief priests,\
and scribes in Jerusalem.\
0:35\
He specifically taught\
them about His death\
0:39\
and glorious Resurrection.\
0:41\
At that point in\
time, His disciples\
0:44\
did not completely understand\
His divine mission on earth.\
0:48\
Peter himself, when he heard\
what the Savior had said,\
0:52\
took Him aside and\
rebuked Him, saying,\
0:56\
"Be it far from thee, Lord:\
this shall not be unto thee."\
1:01\
To help His disciples\
to understand\
1:04\
that devotion to\
His work includes\
1:07\
submission and suffering, the\
Savior emphatically declared:\
1:12\
"If any man will\
come after me, let\
1:15\
him deny himself, and take\
up his cross, and follow me.\
1:21\
"For whosoever will save\
his life shall lose it:\
1:24\
and whosoever will lose his\
life for my sake shall find it.\
1:29\
"For what is a man profited, if\
he shall gain the whole world,\
1:33\
and lose his own soul?\
1:35\
or what shall a man give\
in exchange for his soul?"\
1:40\
Through this declaration, the\
Savior emphasized that all\
1:44\
those who are willing to follow\
Him need to deny themselves\
1:48\
and control their desires,\
appetites, and passions,\
1:52\
sacrificing everything, even\
life itself if necessary,\
1:58\
being entirely submissive to the\
will of the Father--just as He\
2:02\
did.\
2:03\
This is, in fact,\
the price to be paid\
2:05\
for the salvation of a soul.\
2:07\
Jesus purposely\
and metaphorically\
2:10\
used the symbol of the cross\
to help His disciples better\
2:15\
understand what sacrifice and\
devotion to the Lord's cause\
2:19\
would truly mean.\
2:20\
The image of a\
cross was well known\
2:23\
among His disciples and the\
inhabitants of the Roman Empire\
2:27\
because Romans forced\
victims of crucifixion\
2:31\
to publicly carry their own\
cross or crossbeam to the place\
2:36\
where their execution\
would occur.\
2:39\
It was only after the\
Savior's Resurrection\
2:42\
that the disciples'\
minds were opened\
2:44\
to understand all that\
had been written about Him\
2:49\
and what would be required\
of them from that time on.\
2:53\
In the same fashion, all of\
us, brothers and sisters,\
2:56\
need to open our\
minds and our hearts\
2:59\
in order to more\
fully understand\
3:02\
the relevance of taking\
upon ourselves our crosses\
3:06\
and following Him.\
3:07\
We learn through the\
scriptures that those\
3:10\
who wish to take their\
cross upon themselves\
3:13\
love Jesus Christ in such a\
way that they deny themselves\
3:17\
of all ungodliness and\
of every worldly lust\
3:21\
and keep His commandments.\
3:24\
Our determination to cast\
off all that is contrary\
3:27\
to God's will and to sacrifice\
all we are asked to give\
3:32\
and to strive to follow\
His teachings will help us\
3:36\
to endure in the path of\
Jesus Christ's gospel--even\
3:39\
in the face of tribulation,\
weakness of our souls,\
3:44\
or the social pressure and\
worldly philosophies that\
3:47\
oppose His teachings.\
3:49\
For example, for\
those who have not yet\
3:53\
found an eternal\
companion and may\
3:55\
be feeling lonely and hopeless,\
or for those who have been\
3:59\
divorced and feel\
abandoned and forgotten,\
4:02\
I assure you that accepting the\
Savior's invitation of taking\
4:07\
upon yourselves your\
crosses and following\
4:09\
Him means continuing with faith\
on the Lord's path, maintaining\
4:15\
a pattern of dignity,\
and not indulging\
4:18\
in worldly habits that will\
eventually take away our hope\
4:22\
in God's love and mercy.\
4:24\
The same principles\
apply to those of you\
4:27\
who are experiencing\
same-gender attraction\
4:30\
and feel discouraged\
and helpless.\
4:32\
And maybe for this\
reason, some of you\
4:35\
are feeling that the\
gospel of Jesus Christ\
4:37\
is not for you anymore.\
4:39\
If that is the case,\
I want to assure you\
4:43\
that there is always\
hope in God the Father\
4:47\
and in His plan of\
happiness, in Jesus\
4:50\
Christ and His\
atoning sacrifice,\
4:52\
and in living Their\
loving commandments.\
4:55\
In His perfect wisdom,\
power, justice, and mercy,\
4:59\
the Lord may seal\
us His, that we\
5:03\
may be brought to His presence\
and have everlasting salvation,\
5:08\
if we are steadfast and\
immovable in keeping\
5:12\
the commandments and are\
always abounding in good works.\
5:16\
To those who have\
committed serious sins,\
5:20\
accepting this same invitation\
means, among other things,\
5:24\
to humble yourself\
before God, to counsel\
5:27\
with appropriate Church leaders,\
and to repent and forsake\
5:31\
your sins.\
5:32\
This process will\
also bless all who\
5:35\
are fighting\
against debilitating\
5:37\
addictions, including\
opioids, drugs, alcohol,\
5:41\
and pornography.\
5:43\
Taking these steps\
brings you closer\
5:46\
to the Savior,\
who can ultimately\
5:49\
free you from guilt, sorrow, and\
spiritual and physical slavery.\
5:54\
Additionally, you\
may also desire\
5:57\
to seek the support of\
your family, friends,\
6:00\
and competent medical and\
counseling professionals.\
6:04\
Please never give up\
after subsequent failures\
6:08\
and consider yourself\
incapable of abandoning\
6:11\
sins and overcoming addiction.\
6:16\
You cannot afford to stop\
trying and thereafter continue\
6:21\
in weakness and sin!\
6:23\
Always strive to do your best,\
manifesting through your works\
6:29\
the desire to cleanse\
the inner vessel,\
6:32\
as taught by the Savior.\
6:34\
Sometimes solutions\
to certain challenges\
6:36\
come after months and\
months of continuous effort.\
6:40\
The promise found in\
the Book of Mormon\
6:43\
that "it is by grace that we\
are saved, after all we can do,"\
6:47\
is applicable in\
these circumstances.\
6:50\
Please remember that the\
Savior's gift of grace\
6:54\
"is not necessarily limited in\
time to 'after' all we can do.\
6:59\
We may receive His grace before,\
during, and after the time when\
7:04\
we expend our own efforts."\
7:07\
I testify that as we\
continually strive\
7:10\
to overcome our challenges,\
God will bless us\
7:14\
with the gifts of\
faith to be healed\
7:16\
and of the working of miracles.\
7:19\
He will do for us\
what we are not\
7:21\
capable of doing for ourselves.\
7:25\
Additionally, for those who\
feel bitter, angry, offended,\
7:29\
or chained to\
sorrows for something\
7:32\
you feel is undeserved,\
to take up one's cross\
7:36\
and follow the Savior\
means to strive\
7:38\
to lay aside these feelings\
and turn to the Lord\
7:42\
so He can free us from\
this state of mind\
7:46\
and help us to find peace.\
7:48\
Unfortunately, if we hold on\
to these negative feelings\
7:53\
and emotions, we\
may find ourselves\
7:56\
living without the influence of\
the Lord's Spirit in our lives.\
8:01\
We cannot repent\
for other people,\
8:03\
but we can forgive them--by\
refusing to be held hostages\
8:08\
by those who have harmed us.\
8:11\
The scriptures teach that\
there is a way out of these\
8:14\
situations--by inviting our\
Savior to help us to replace\
8:19\
our stony hearts\
with new hearts.\
8:22\
For this to happen, we need\
to come before the Lord\
8:26\
with our weaknesses and implore\
His help and forgiveness,\
8:30\
especially during the sacred\
moment when we partake\
8:34\
of the sacrament each Sunday.\
8:36\
May we choose to seek\
His help and take\
8:39\
an important and difficult\
step by forgiving\
8:44\
those who have hurt us so that\
our wounds may begin to heal.\
8:52\
I promise you that\
in your doing so,\
8:55\
your nights will be\
full of the relief that\
8:59\
comes from a mind at\
peace with the Lord.\
9:02\
While in the Liberty\
Jail in 1839,\
9:04\
the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote\
an epistle to Church members\
9:09\
containing prophecies\
that are so very\
9:12\
applicable in all these\
circumstances and situations.\
9:15\
He wrote, "All thrones and\
dominions, principalities\
9:20\
and powers, shall be\
revealed and set forth\
9:24\
upon all who have\
endured valiantly\
9:26\
for the gospel of Jesus Christ."\
9:30\
Therefore, my dear brothers and\
sisters, those who [have taken]\
9:34\
upon themselves the\
name of the Savior,\
9:36\
trusting in His promises\
and persevering to the end,\
9:41\
will be saved and\
may dwell with God\
9:44\
in a state of\
never-ending happiness.\
9:48\
We all face adverse\
circumstances in our lives\
9:52\
that make us feel sad, helpless,\
hopeless, and sometimes even\
9:57\
weakened.\
9:58\
Some of these\
feelings may lead us\
10:00\
to question the Lord: "Why am I\
experiencing these situations?"\
10:05\
or "Why are my\
expectations not met?\
10:09\
After all, I am doing everything\
in my power to carry my cross\
10:14\
and follow the Savior!"\
10:16\
My dear friends,\
we must remember\
10:19\
that taking our\
cross upon ourselves\
10:22\
includes being humble\
and trusting in God\
10:25\
and in His infinite wisdom.\
10:27\
We must acknowledge that\
He is aware of each of us\
10:31\
and of our needs.\
10:33\
It is also necessary to accept\
the fact that the Lord's\
10:37\
timing is different than ours.\
10:39\
Sometimes we seek for a\
blessing and set a time limit\
10:44\
for the Lord to fulfill it.\
10:46\
We cannot condition our\
faithfulness to Him by imposing\
10:50\
upon Him a deadline for\
the answers to our desires.\
10:55\
When we do this, we resemble\
the skeptical Nephites\
10:59\
from ancient times who\
mocked their brethren\
11:03\
by saying that the time was\
past for the fulfillment\
11:06\
of the words spoken by\
Samuel the Lamanite,\
11:10\
creating confusion among\
those who believed.\
11:13\
We need to trust the Lord\
enough to be still and know\
11:19\
that He is God, that\
He knows all things,\
11:22\
and that He is\
aware of each of us.\
11:26\
I recently had the\
opportunity to minister\
11:31\
to a widowed sister named Franca\
Calamassi, who is suffering\
11:35\
from a debilitating illness.\
11:37\
Sister Calamassi\
was the first member\
11:40\
of her family to\
join the restored\
11:43\
Church of Jesus Christ.\
11:44\
Although her husband\
was never baptized,\
11:48\
he consented to meet\
with the missionaries\
11:51\
and often attended\
Church meetings.\
11:53\
Despite these circumstances,\
Sister Calamassi\
11:57\
remained faithful and\
raised her four children\
12:00\
in the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
12:03\
A year following her\
husband's passing,\
12:05\
Sister Calamassi took her\
children to the temple,\
12:09\
and they participated\
in sacred ordinances\
12:12\
and were sealed\
together as a family.\
12:15\
The promises associated\
with these ordinances\
12:19\
brought her much hope,\
joy, and happiness that\
12:23\
helped her carry on in life.\
12:26\
When the first symptoms of\
the disease began to appear,\
12:30\
her bishop gave her a blessing.\
12:32\
At that time she told\
her bishop that she\
12:36\
was ready to accept the Lord's\
will, expressing her faith\
12:40\
to be healed as well\
as her faith to endure\
12:45\
her illness to the end.\
12:47\
During my visit, while holding\
Sister Calamassi's hand\
12:51\
and looking into her eyes, I saw\
an angelic glow emanating from\
12:58\
her countenance--reflecting\
her confidence in God's plan\
13:03\
and her perfect brightness\
of hope in the Father's love\
13:07\
and plan for her.\
13:08\
I felt her firm determination\
to endure in her faith\
13:13\
until the end by\
taking up her cross,\
13:19\
despite the challenges\
she was facing.\
13:22\
This sister's life is\
a testimony of Christ,\
13:26\
a statement of her faith\
and devotion to Him.\
13:30\
Brothers and sisters, I\
want to testify to you\
13:34\
that taking upon us\
our cross and following\
13:38\
the Savior requires us\
to follow His example\
13:41\
to strive to become like\
Him, patiently facing\
13:45\
the circumstances of life,\
denying and despising\
13:50\
the appetites of the natural\
man, and waiting on the Lord.\
13:54\
The Psalmist wrote:\
13:56\
"Wait on the Lord:\
be of good courage,\
14:00\
and he shall strengthen\
thine heart: wait, I say,\
14:03\
on the Lord."\
14:05\
"He is our help and our shield."\
14:08\
I testify to you that following\
our Master's footsteps\
14:12\
and waiting on Him who is the\
ultimate healer of our lives\
14:17\
will provide rest to\
our souls and make\
14:21\
our burdens easy and light.\
14:23\
Of these things I testify\
in the sacred name\
14:27\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
