Thank you, dear\
President Nelson,\
0:03\
for that joyful revelatory\
guidance with respect\
0:07\
to witnesses at baptisms\
and the direction\
0:10\
you have asked us\
to share to help\
0:12\
strengthen youth and develop\
their sacred potential.\
0:16\
Before I share\
those adjustments,\
0:17\
we express our\
sincere appreciation\
0:19\
for the exceptional\
way members have\
0:21\
responded to developments\
in the ongoing Restoration\
0:25\
of the gospel.\
0:26\
As President Nelson\
suggested last year,\
0:29\
you have taken your vitamins!\
0:33\
You joyfully study\
Come, Follow Me at home.\
0:36\
You have also responded\
to adjustments at church.\
0:39\
Members of the elders quorum\
and Relief Society sisters\
0:42\
unitedly do the\
work of salvation.\
0:45\
Our gratitude is overflowing.\
0:48\
We are particularly grateful\
that our youth continue\
0:51\
to remain strong and faithful.\
0:54\
Our youth live in an exciting\
but also challenging time.\
0:58\
The choices available have\
never been more dramatic.\
1:02\
One example: the modern\
smartphone provides access\
1:07\
to incredibly important\
and uplifting information,\
1:10\
including family history\
and the holy scriptures.\
1:14\
On the other hand, it contains\
foolishness, immorality,\
1:18\
and evil not readily\
available in the past.\
1:22\
To help our youth navigate\
this maze of choices,\
1:26\
the Church has prepared three\
profound and comprehensive\
1:30\
initiatives.\
1:31\
First, curriculum has been\
strengthened and expanded\
1:35\
to the home.\
1:36\
Second, a children\
and youth program\
1:40\
that includes\
exciting activities\
1:42\
and personal development was\
presented just last Sunday\
1:46\
by President Nelson,\
President Ballard,\
1:49\
and the General Officers.\
1:51\
A third initiative is\
organizational changes\
1:55\
to make youth a more\
significant focus of our bishops\
1:59\
and other leaders.\
2:00\
This focus must be\
spiritually powerful\
2:04\
and help our youth become\
the youth battalion\
2:07\
President Nelson has\
asked them to become.\
2:11\
These efforts,\
together with those\
2:12\
announced during\
the last few years,\
2:15\
are not isolated changes.\
2:17\
Each of the adjustments\
is an integral part\
2:21\
of an interlocking pattern\
to bless the Saints\
2:24\
and prepare them to meet God.\
2:27\
One part of the pattern relates\
to the rising generation.\
2:31\
Our youth are being asked\
to take more individual\
2:34\
responsibility at younger\
ages--without parents\
2:38\
and leaders taking over what\
youth can do for themselves.\
2:43\
Today we announce\
organizational changes for youth\
2:46\
at ward and stake levels.\
2:48\
As President Nelson explained,\
Sister Bonnie H. Cordon\
2:51\
will discuss changes for\
young women this evening.\
2:55\
One purpose for the\
changes I will now discuss\
2:58\
is to strengthen Aaronic\
Priesthood holders, quorums,\
3:02\
and quorum presidencies.\
3:04\
These changes align our practice\
with Doctrine and Covenants\
3:08\
section 107:15, which\
reads, "The bishopric is\
3:12\
the presidency of this [Aaronic]\
priesthood, and holds the keys\
3:17\
or authority of the same."\
3:19\
One of the scriptural\
duties of the bishop\
3:21\
is to preside over the\
priests and to sit in council\
3:24\
with them, teaching them\
the duties of their office.\
3:27\
In addition, the first\
counselor in the bishopric\
3:30\
will have specific\
responsibility\
3:33\
for teachers and the second\
counselor, for deacons.\
3:37\
Accordingly, to align with\
this revelation in the Doctrine\
3:40\
and Covenants, Young Men\
presidencies at the ward level\
3:45\
will be discontinued.\
3:46\
These faithful brethren\
have done much good,\
3:49\
and we express\
appreciation to them.\
3:53\
It is our hope that bishoprics\
will give great emphasis\
3:56\
and focus to the priesthood\
responsibilities of young men\
4:00\
and help them in\
their quorum duties.\
4:03\
Capable adult Young\
Men advisers will\
4:05\
be called to assist the\
Aaronic Priesthood quorum\
4:08\
presidencies and the\
bishopric in their duties.\
4:11\
We are confident that more\
young men and young women\
4:14\
will rise to the challenge\
and stay on the covenant path\
4:18\
with this laser-like\
focus on our youth.\
4:23\
In the Lord's inspired\
pattern, the bishop\
4:25\
has responsibility for\
everyone in the ward.\
4:28\
He blesses the parents of\
youth as well as the youth.\
4:32\
One bishop found\
that as he counseled\
4:34\
with a young man struggling\
with pornography,\
4:37\
he could help the young\
man in his repentance\
4:40\
only as he helped\
the parents react\
4:43\
with love and understanding.\
4:45\
The young man's healing was\
a healing for his family\
4:49\
and was possible through\
the bishop working\
4:52\
in behalf of the entire family.\
4:54\
The young man has now become a\
worthy Melchizedek Priesthood\
4:58\
holder and full-time missionary.\
5:01\
As this account suggests,\
these adjustments will:\
5:04\
Help bishops and\
their counselors\
5:06\
focus on their core\
responsibilities\
5:08\
to the youth and\
Primary children.\
5:11\
Place the power and duties\
of the Aaronic Priesthood\
5:14\
at the center of every young\
man's personal life and goals.\
5:19\
THESE ADJUSTMENTS ALSO:\
Emphasize the responsibilities\
5:22\
of Aaronic Priesthood\
quorum presidencies\
5:25\
and their direct reporting\
line to the bishopric.\
5:29\
Motivate adult leaders to assist\
and mentor Aaronic Priesthood\
5:32\
quorum presidencies in\
magnifying the power\
5:36\
and authority of their office.\
5:38\
As noted, these\
adjustments do not\
5:40\
lessen the bishoprics'\
responsibility for young women.\
5:45\
As President Nelson just\
taught, "[The bishop's] first\
5:49\
and foremost responsibility\
is to care for the young men\
5:53\
and young women of his ward.\
5:57\
How will our beloved\
and hardworking bishops\
6:00\
fulfill this responsibility?\
6:02\
As you remember, in 2018,\
Melchizedek Priesthood quorums\
6:06\
were adjusted to work even more\
closely with Relief Societies\
6:11\
so that elders quorums\
and Relief Societies\
6:13\
can, under the\
direction of the bishop,\
6:16\
help shoulder important\
responsibilities\
6:20\
that previously consumed\
much of his time.\
6:23\
These responsibilities include\
missionary work and temple\
6:27\
and family history work in\
the ward--as well as much\
6:30\
of the ministering\
to ward members.\
6:33\
The bishop cannot delegate\
some responsibilities,\
6:38\
such as the youth,\
being a common judge,\
6:44\
caring for those in need,\
and overseeing finances\
6:48\
and temporal affairs.\
6:50\
These are, however,\
fewer than we may\
6:53\
have understood in the past.\
6:55\
As Elder Jeffrey R.\
Holland explained last year\
6:58\
when the adjustments to the\
Melchizedek Priesthood quorums\
7:01\
were announced: "The\
bishop remains, of course,\
7:05\
the presiding high\
priest of the ward.\
7:07\
This new alignment [of elders\
quorums and Relief Societies]\
7:11\
should let him preside over\
the work of the Melchizedek\
7:14\
Priesthood and\
the Relief Society\
7:17\
without requiring him\
to do the work of either\
7:21\
of those bodies."\
7:23\
For instance, a Relief Society\
president and an elders quorum\
7:26\
president, as assigned, can take\
a greater role in counseling\
7:30\
with adults--as can a Young\
Women president in counseling\
7:35\
with young women.\
7:36\
While only the bishop can\
serve as a common judge,\
7:40\
these other leaders are entitled\
to revelation from heaven\
7:44\
to help with challenges that\
do not require a common judge\
7:49\
or involve abuse of any kind.\
7:52\
That doesn't mean a young\
woman cannot or should not talk\
7:55\
to the bishop or to her parents.\
7:58\
Their focus is the youth!\
8:00\
But it does mean that a\
Young Women leader may best\
8:03\
meet the needs of an\
individual young woman.\
8:06\
The bishopric is as\
concerned for young women as\
8:10\
for young men, but we\
recognize the strength\
8:13\
that comes from having\
strong, engaged, and focused\
8:16\
Young Women leaders\
who love and mentor,\
8:19\
not taking over the roles\
of class presidencies\
8:22\
but helping youth\
succeed in those roles.\
8:26\
Sister Cordon will share\
additional exciting changes\
8:29\
for young women tonight.\
8:30\
I, however, announce that ward\
Young Women presidents will now\
8:34\
report to and counsel directly\
with the bishop of the ward.\
8:39\
In the past, this\
assignment could\
8:41\
be delegated to a counselor,\
but going forward,\
8:45\
young women will be a\
direct responsibility\
8:47\
of the one who holds\
presiding keys for the ward.\
8:51\
The Relief Society\
president will\
8:53\
continue to report\
directly to the bishop.\
8:56\
At the general and\
stake levels, we\
8:58\
will continue to have\
Young Men presidencies.\
9:01\
At the stake level,\
a high councilor\
9:04\
will be the Young Men\
president and will,\
9:09\
with the high councilors\
assigned to Young Women\
9:11\
and Primary, be part of the\
stake Aaronic Priesthood-Young\
9:15\
Women Committee.\
9:16\
These brethren will work\
with the stake Young Women\
9:19\
presidency on this committee.\
9:21\
With a counselor to the\
stake president as chair,\
9:25\
this committee will have\
increased importance\
9:28\
because many of the programs and\
activities in the new "Children\
9:32\
and Youth" initiative will\
be at the stake level.\
9:36\
These high councilors, under\
the direction of the stake\
9:39\
presidency, can serve as\
a resource to the bishop\
9:43\
and Aaronic Priesthood\
quorums in a manner\
9:46\
similar to the service\
provided by high councilors\
9:49\
to ward elders quorums.\
9:52\
As a related matter,\
another high councilor\
9:55\
will serve as the stake\
Sunday School president\
9:58\
and, as needed, could\
serve on the stake Aaronic\
10:01\
Priesthood-Young\
Women Committee.\
10:04\
Additional organization changes\
will be further explained\
10:07\
in information sent to leaders.\
10:09\
These changes include:\
10:12\
The bishopric youth\
committee meeting\
10:14\
will be replaced by\
a ward youth council.\
10:18\
The word Mutual will be\
retired and become Young Women\
10:21\
activities, Aaronic Priesthood\
quorum activities, or youth\
10:24\
activities and will be\
held weekly where possible.\
10:29\
The ward budget for\
youth activities\
10:30\
will be divided equitably\
between the young men\
10:33\
and young women according\
to the number of youth\
10:36\
in each organization.\
10:38\
A sufficient amount\
will be provided\
10:40\
for Primary activities.\
10:42\
At all levels--ward, stake, and\
general--we will use the term\
10:47\
organization rather\
than the term auxiliary.\
10:50\
Those who lead the General\
Relief Society, Young Women,\
10:54\
Young Men, Primary, and\
Sunday School organizations\
10:57\
will be known as\
General Officers.\
11:00\
Those who lead organizations\
at the ward and stake levels\
11:04\
will be known as ward\
officers and stake officers.\
11:08\
The adjustments\
announced today may\
11:10\
begin as soon as branches,\
wards, districts, and stakes\
11:13\
are ready but should be in\
place by January 1, 2020.\
11:18\
These adjustments,\
when combined and\
11:21\
integrated with\
previous adjustments,\
11:23\
represent a spiritual\
and organizational effort\
11:28\
consistent with doctrine\
to bless and strengthen\
11:31\
every man, woman, youth, and\
child, helping each to follow\
11:36\
the example of our\
Savior, Jesus Christ,\
11:38\
as we progress on\
the covenant path.\
11:42\
Dear brothers and sisters,\
I promise and testify\
11:46\
that these comprehensive\
adjustments,\
11:48\
under the direction of an\
inspired president and prophet,\
11:51\
Russell M. Nelson, will\
empower and strengthen\
11:55\
every member of the Church.\
11:56\
Our youth will develop\
greater faith in the Savior,\
12:00\
be protected from the\
temptations of the adversary,\
12:03\
and stand prepared to\
meet life's challenges.\
12:08\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
