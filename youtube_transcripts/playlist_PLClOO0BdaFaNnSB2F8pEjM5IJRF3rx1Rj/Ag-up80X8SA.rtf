Thank you, Elder Alliaud\
and Elder Bednar,\
0:05\
for your messages.\
0:07\
Dear brothers and sisters, it is\
wonderful to be with you again\
0:10\
in general conference.\
0:12\
Earlier this week,\
announcements were\
0:14\
made to members of the Church\
about changes in policy\
0:17\
regarding who may serve\
as witnesses to baptism\
0:21\
and sealing ordinances.\
0:23\
I would like to highlight\
those three points:\
0:26\
1.\
0:29\
A proxy baptism for\
a deceased person\
0:32\
may be witnessed\
by anyone holding\
0:35\
a current temple\
recommend, including\
0:37\
a limited-use recommend.\
0:40\
2.\
0:40\
Any endowed member\
with a current temple\
0:44\
recommend may serve as a witness\
to sealing ordinances, living\
0:50\
and proxy.\
0:51\
3.\
0:52\
Any baptized member\
of the Church\
0:55\
may serve as a witness of the\
baptism of a living person.\
1:00\
This change pertains to all\
baptisms outside the temple.\
1:06\
These policy adjustments\
are procedural.\
1:08\
The underlying\
doctrine and covenants\
1:10\
are unchanged and are equally\
efficacious in all ordinances.\
1:16\
These changes should greatly\
enhance family participation\
1:20\
in these ordinances.\
1:23\
I also wanted to speak\
with you at this time\
1:25\
to introduce\
adjustments that pertain\
1:27\
to our youth and their leaders.\
1:32\
You will remember that I have\
invited the youth of The Church\
1:35\
of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints to enlist\
1:38\
in the Lord's youth battalion\
to participate in the greatest\
1:42\
cause on earth today--the\
gathering of Israel.\
1:47\
I issued this\
invitation to our youth\
1:49\
because they are unusually\
gifted in reaching out\
1:52\
to others and sharing\
what they believe\
1:55\
in a convincing fashion.\
1:57\
The cause of the gathering\
is an essential part\
2:00\
of helping to prepare\
the world and its people\
2:03\
for the Second\
Coming of the Lord.\
2:08\
In each ward, the\
Lord's youth battalion\
2:11\
is led by a bishop, a\
dedicated servant of God.\
2:16\
His first and foremost\
responsibility\
2:20\
is to care for the young men\
and young women of his ward.\
2:24\
The bishop and his\
counselors direct\
2:27\
the work of the Aaronic\
Priesthood quorums\
2:30\
and the Young Women\
classes in the ward.\
2:36\
The adjustments we\
will now announce\
2:38\
are intended to help\
young men and young women\
2:41\
develop their sacred\
personal potential.\
2:48\
We also want to strengthen\
Aaronic Priesthood quorums\
2:51\
and Young Women classes\
and provide support\
2:55\
to bishops and\
other adult leaders\
2:57\
as they serve this\
rising generation.\
3:02\
Elder Quentin L. Cook will\
now discuss the adjustments\
3:05\
that relate to the young men.\
3:08\
And tonight, at the\
general women's session,\
3:12\
Sister Bonnie H. Cordon,\
Young Women General President,\
3:17\
will discuss the adjustments\
that relate to the young women.\
3:22\
The First Presidency\
and the Twelve\
3:23\
are united in endorsing\
these efforts to strengthen\
3:26\
our youth.\
3:27\
Oh, how we love them\
and pray for them!\
3:30\
They are the "hope of\
Israel, Zion's army,\
3:33\
children of the promised day."\
3:36\
We express our complete\
confidence in our youth\
3:40\
and our gratitude for\
them in the sacred name\
3:43\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
