While visiting their homes, one\
of the questions I frequently\
0:05\
like to ask converts is\
how they and their families\
0:08\
learned about the Church and\
how they came to be baptized.\
0:12\
It doesn't matter if the\
person in that moment\
0:15\
is an active member or hasn't\
attended Church for many years.\
0:18\
The answer is always\
the same: with a smile\
0:22\
and their countenance\
glowing, they\
0:23\
begin to tell the story\
of how they were found.\
0:27\
In fact, it seems that\
the story of conversion\
0:30\
is always the story\
of how we are found.\
0:34\
Jesus Christ Himself is\
the Lord of lost things.\
0:37\
He cares for lost things.\
0:39\
That is surely why He\
taught the three parables\
0:42\
that we find in the\
15th chapter of Luke:\
0:44\
the parable of the lost\
sheep, the lost coin,\
0:47\
and, finally, the prodigal son.\
0:50\
All of these stories have\
a common denominator:\
0:53\
It doesn't matter\
why they were lost.\
0:55\
It doesn't matter, even, if they\
were aware that they were lost.\
0:58\
There reigns supreme\
a feeling of joy\
1:02\
that exclaims: "Rejoice\
with me; for I have found\
1:05\
[that] which was lost."\
1:08\
In the end, nothing\
is truly lost to Him.\
1:12\
Allow me to share,\
this afternoon,\
1:15\
with you one of the most\
precious things to me--the\
1:18\
story of how I myself was found.\
1:21\
Just before I turned\
15, I was invited\
1:24\
by my uncle, Manuel\
Bustos, to spend\
1:25\
some time with\
him and his family\
1:28\
here in the United States.\
1:30\
That would be a great\
opportunity for me\
1:32\
to learn some English.\
1:34\
My uncle had converted to\
the Church many years before,\
1:38\
and he had a great\
missionary spirit.\
1:40\
That is probably why my\
mother, without me knowing,\
1:43\
spoke with him and said\
that she would agree\
1:46\
to the invitation\
on one condition:\
1:48\
that he did not try to\
convince me to become\
1:51\
a member of his Church.\
1:53\
We were Catholics, and we\
had been for generations,\
1:56\
and there was no\
reason to change.\
1:58\
My uncle was in\
complete agreement\
2:01\
and kept his word\
up to the point\
2:02\
that he didn't want to\
answer even simple questions\
2:05\
about the Church.\
2:07\
Of course, what my uncle and\
his sweet wife, Marjorie,\
2:11\
could not avoid was\
being who they were.\
2:15\
I was assigned a\
room that contained\
2:17\
a large library of books.\
2:19\
I could see that in\
that library there\
2:22\
were roughly 200 copies\
of the Book of Mormon\
2:25\
in different languages,\
20 of them in Spanish.\
2:32\
One day, out of\
curiosity, I took down\
2:34\
a copy of the Book\
of Mormon in Spanish.\
2:37\
It was one of those copies\
with a sky-blue soft cover,\
2:40\
with the figure of the\
angel Moroni on the front.\
2:43\
Upon opening it,\
on the first page,\
2:47\
there was written the\
following promise:\
2:50\
"And when ye shall\
receive these things,\
2:53\
I would exhort you that ye would\
ask God, the Eternal Father,\
2:58\
in the name of Christ, if\
these things are not true;\
3:02\
and if ye shall ask\
with a sincere heart,\
3:06\
with real intent,\
having faith in Christ,\
3:09\
he will manifest the\
truth of it unto you,\
3:12\
by the power of the Holy Ghost."\
3:15\
AND THEN IT ADDED:\
"And by the power\
3:17\
of the Holy Ghost ye may know\
the truth of all things."\
3:22\
It is difficult to explain the\
impact that these scriptures\
3:26\
had on my mind and heart.\
3:27\
To be honest, I was not\
looking for "the truth."\
3:30\
I was just a teenager,\
happy with his life,\
3:32\
enjoying this new culture.\
3:35\
Nevertheless, with\
that promise in mind,\
3:37\
I secretly began\
reading the book.\
3:40\
As I read more, I\
understood that if I really\
3:42\
wanted to get\
anything from this,\
3:44\
I had better start to pray.\
3:46\
And we all know\
what happens when\
3:50\
you decide not only\
to read but to pray\
3:53\
about the Book of Mormon.\
3:54\
Well, that just happened to me.\
3:57\
It was something so\
special and so unique--yes,\
4:00\
just the same that had happened\
to millions of others around\
4:05\
the world.\
4:05\
I came to know by the\
power of the Holy Ghost\
4:08\
that the Book of\
Mormon was true.\
4:11\
I then went to my\
uncle to explain\
4:12\
to him what had\
happened and that I\
4:14\
was ready to be baptized.\
4:16\
My uncle could not\
contain his astonishment.\
4:19\
He got into his car,\
drove to the airport,\
4:22\
and returned back with a\
plane ticket to fly back home,\
4:25\
with a note addressed to my\
mother that simply stated, "I\
4:29\
had nothing to do with this!"\
4:33\
In a way, he was right.\
4:35\
I had been found directly by\
the power of the Book of Mormon.\
4:39\
There may be many\
who have been found\
4:41\
through wonderful\
missionaries around the world,\
4:43\
in every case through\
miraculous ways.\
4:46\
Or maybe they have been\
found through friends\
4:49\
that God has deliberately\
placed in their path.\
4:52\
It might be even\
that they have been\
4:55\
found by someone\
from this generation\
4:57\
or through one of\
their ancestors.\
4:59\
Whatever the case,\
in order to progress\
5:02\
towards a true\
personal conversion,\
5:05\
sooner rather than\
later, they all\
5:07\
must experience and\
be found by the power\
5:11\
of the truth contained\
in the Book of Mormon.\
5:13\
At the same time,\
they must personally\
5:16\
decide to make a serious\
commitment to God\
5:19\
that they will strive to\
keep His commandments.\
5:23\
Upon returning to\
Buenos Aires, my mother\
5:25\
realized that I truly\
wanted to be baptized.\
5:28\
Since I had, somewhat, a\
rebellious spirit, instead\
5:32\
of opposing me, she very\
wisely took my side.\
5:35\
And without even knowing it,\
she did my baptismal interview\
5:39\
herself.\
5:40\
Indeed, I believe\
that her interview\
5:43\
was even more\
in-depth than those\
5:45\
that our missionaries conduct.\
5:47\
She told me, "If you want to be\
baptized, I will support you.\
5:51\
But first I'm going to\
ask you some questions,\
5:54\
and I want you to think very\
hard and answer me honestly.\
5:59\
Do you commit to attend church\
absolutely every Sunday?"\
6:03\
I told her, "Yes, of course,\
I'm going to do that."\
6:06\
"Do you have any idea\
how long church is?"\
6:09\
"Yes, I know," I said.\
6:11\
She replied, "Well,\
if you get baptized,\
6:14\
I am going to make\
sure that you attend."\
6:17\
Then she asked me if I was\
truly willing to never drink\
6:21\
alcohol or smoke.\
6:22\
I answered her,\
"Yes, of course, I\
6:23\
am going to comply\
with that as well."\
6:26\
To which she added,\
"If you get baptized,\
6:29\
I am going to make sure\
that that is the case."\
6:32\
And she proceeded\
on in that way,\
6:35\
almost, with every commandment.\
6:38\
My uncle had called my mother\
to tell her not to worry,\
6:41\
that I would get over this soon.\
6:45\
Four years later, when\
I received my call\
6:47\
to serve in the Uruguay\
Montevideo Mission,\
6:50\
my mother called my uncle\
to ask him when exactly I\
6:53\
was going to get over all this.\
6:57\
The truth is that from\
the time I was baptized,\
7:01\
my mother was a happier mother.\
7:03\
I came to know that\
the Book of Mormon\
7:05\
was crucial in the\
conversion process\
7:08\
by experiencing\
firsthand the promise\
7:10\
that "a man would\
get nearer to God\
7:13\
by abiding by its precepts."\
7:17\
Nephi explained the central\
purpose of the Book of Mormon\
7:20\
in this way:\
7:22\
"For we labor\
diligently to write,\
7:24\
to persuade our children,\
and also our brethren,\
7:27\
to believe in Christ, and\
to be reconciled to God. ...\
7:31\
"And [so] we talk of Christ,\
we rejoice in Christ,\
7:35\
we preach of Christ, [and]\
we prophesy of Christ, ...\
7:39\
that our children may know\
to what source they may look\
7:43\
for a remission of their sins."\
7:47\
The entire Book of\
Mormon is imbued\
7:50\
with that same sacred purpose.\
7:53\
For this reason, any reader\
who commits to a sincere study\
7:56\
of it, with the\
spirit of prayer,\
7:59\
will not only\
learn about Christ,\
8:02\
but he will learn from\
Christ--especially if he makes\
8:07\
the decision to "try\
the virtue of the word"\
8:11\
and not reject it prematurely\
due to prejudiced unbelief\
8:15\
by what others have said about\
things they have never read.\
8:20\
President Russell\
M. Nelson reflected:\
8:22\
"When I think of\
the Book of Mormon,\
8:25\
I think of the word power.\
8:27\
The truths of the Book\
of Mormon have the power\
8:29\
to heal, comfort, restore,\
succor, strengthen, console,\
8:36\
and cheer our souls."\
8:39\
My invitation this\
afternoon to each of us,\
8:42\
regardless how long we've\
been a member of the Church,\
8:45\
is to allow the power of the\
truths of the Book of Mormon\
8:49\
to find us and embrace us\
once again and day after day\
8:54\
as we diligently seek\
for personal revelation.\
8:57\
It will do so if we allow it.\
9:00\
I solemnly testify\
that the Book of Mormon\
9:03\
contains the fulness of\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
9:06\
and that the Holy Ghost\
will confirm the truth of it\
9:09\
time after time to anyone\
who, with a sincere heart,\
9:12\
seeks knowledge unto the\
salvation of their soul.\
9:15\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
