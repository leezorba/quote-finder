Thank you for that\
beautiful music.\
0:04\
As we all stood to sing\
the intermediate hymn,\
0:08\
"We Thank Thee, O\
God, for a Prophet,"\
0:11\
I had two overpowering\
thoughts come to me.\
0:14\
One is about the Prophet\
Joseph Smith, the prophet\
0:19\
of this dispensation.\
0:21\
My love and admiration for him\
grows with every passing day.\
0:28\
And the second\
thought occurred as I\
0:30\
looked at my wife, my\
daughters, granddaughters,\
0:35\
great-granddaughters.\
0:37\
I felt like I'd like to\
claim every one of you\
0:41\
as part of my family.\
0:43\
So if you're looking for an\
extra grandpa, give me a call.\
0:53\
Several months ago, at the end\
of a temple endowment session,\
0:58\
I said to my wife,\
"Wendy, I hope\
1:02\
the sisters understand the\
spiritual treasures that\
1:05\
are theirs in the temple."\
1:09\
Sisters, I often find\
myself thinking about you,\
1:13\
including two months ago\
when Wendy and I visited\
1:16\
Harmony, Pennsylvania.\
1:19\
This was our second trip there.\
1:21\
Both times we have\
been deeply moved\
1:24\
as we walked on\
that sacred ground.\
1:27\
It was in Harmony\
that John the Baptist\
1:31\
appeared to Joseph Smith\
and restored the Aaronic\
1:34\
Priesthood.\
1:36\
It was there that the Apostles\
Peter, James, and John\
1:39\
appeared to restore the\
Melchizedek Priesthood.\
1:45\
It was in Harmony\
that Emma Hale Smith\
1:48\
served as her\
husband's first scribe\
1:51\
while the Prophet translated\
the Book of Mormon.\
1:56\
It was also in Harmony that\
Joseph received a revelation\
1:59\
manifesting the\
Lord's will to Emma.\
2:05\
The Lord instructed Emma\
to expound the scriptures,\
2:10\
to exhort the Church, to\
receive the Holy Ghost,\
2:15\
and to spend her\
time "learning much."\
2:21\
Emma was also counseled to "lay\
aside the things of this world\
2:25\
and seek for the things\
of a better," and to hold\
2:29\
fast to her covenants with God.\
2:33\
The Lord concluded\
His instruction\
2:35\
with these compelling words:\
"This is my voice unto all."\
2:42\
Everything that\
happened in Harmony\
2:45\
has profound implications\
for your lives.\
2:49\
The restoration\
of the priesthood,\
2:52\
along with the Lord's\
counsel to Emma,\
2:55\
can guide and bless each of you.\
3:00\
How I yearn for\
you to understand\
3:03\
that the restoration\
of the priesthood\
3:05\
is just as relevant to you as\
a woman as it is to any man.\
3:12\
Because the Melchizedek\
Priesthood has been restored,\
3:15\
both covenant-keeping\
women and men\
3:19\
have access to "all\
the spiritual blessings\
3:23\
of the church,"\
or, we might say,\
3:27\
to all the spiritual treasures\
the Lord has for His children.\
3:36\
Every woman and every man\
who makes covenants with God\
3:39\
and keeps those covenants,\
and who participates worthily\
3:44\
in priesthood ordinances,\
has direct access\
3:49\
to the power of God.\
3:53\
Those who are endowed\
in the house of the Lord\
3:55\
received a gift of\
God's priesthood power\
3:58\
by virtue of their covenant,\
along with a gift of knowledge\
4:04\
to know how to draw\
upon that power.\
4:10\
The heavens are just\
as open to women\
4:13\
who are endowed with God's\
power, that power flowing\
4:17\
from their priesthood\
covenants, as they are\
4:20\
to men who bear the priesthood.\
4:24\
I pray that truth will register\
upon each of your hearts\
4:28\
because I believe it\
will change your life.\
4:34\
Sisters, dear sisters,\
you have the right\
4:39\
to draw liberally upon\
the Savior's power\
4:42\
to help your family\
and others you love.\
4:49\
Now you might be\
saying to yourself,\
4:50\
"This sounds wonderful,\
but how do I do it?\
4:55\
How do I draw the Savior's\
power into my life?"\
5:00\
You won't find this process\
spelled out in any manual.\
5:03\
The Holy Ghost will\
be your personal tutor\
5:07\
as you seek to understand\
what the Lord would\
5:10\
have you know and do.\
5:14\
This process is\
neither quick nor easy,\
5:19\
but it is spiritually\
invigorating.\
5:22\
What could possibly be more\
exciting than to labor with\
5:25\
the Spirit to understand\
God's power--priesthood power?\
5:32\
What I can tell you is that\
accessing the power of God\
5:36\
in your life requires the same\
things that the Lord instructed\
5:40\
Emma and each of you to do.\
5:44\
So, I invite you to\
study prayerfully\
5:48\
section 25 of the\
Doctrine and Covenants\
5:52\
and discover what the\
Holy Ghost will teach you.\
5:57\
Your personal spiritual\
endeavor will bring you joy\
6:02\
as you gain, understand, and\
use the power with which you\
6:08\
have been endowed.\
6:12\
Part of this endeavor will\
require you to put aside\
6:16\
many things of this world.\
6:19\
Sometimes we speak almost\
casually about walking away\
6:23\
from the world with\
its contention,\
6:25\
pervasive temptations,\
and false philosophies.\
6:29\
But truly doing so requires\
you to examine your life\
6:34\
meticulously and regularly.\
6:38\
As you do so, the Holy\
Ghost will prompt you\
6:41\
about what is no\
longer needful, what\
6:44\
is no longer worthy of\
your time and energy.\
6:51\
As you shift your focus away\
from worldly distractions,\
6:56\
some things that\
seem important to you\
6:59\
now will recede in priority.\
7:02\
You will need to say\
no to some things,\
7:06\
even though they\
may seem harmless.\
7:09\
As you embark upon and\
continue this lifelong process\
7:13\
of consecrating your\
life to the Lord,\
7:18\
the changes in your\
perspective, feelings,\
7:22\
and spiritual strength\
will amaze you!\
7:28\
Now, a little word of warning.\
7:32\
There are those who would\
undermine your ability\
7:35\
to call upon the power of God.\
7:38\
There are some who would have\
you doubt yourself and minimize\
7:43\
your stellar spiritual\
capacity as a righteous woman.\
7:51\
Most certainly, the adversary\
does not want you to understand\
7:54\
the covenant you made at baptism\
or the profound endowment\
7:58\
of knowledge and power you\
have received or will receive\
8:02\
in the temple--the\
house of the Lord.\
8:07\
And Satan certainly\
does not want\
8:10\
you to understand that every\
time you worthily serve\
8:13\
and worship in the temple, you\
leave armed with God's power\
8:18\
and with His angels\
having "charge over" you.\
8:26\
Satan and his minions\
will constantly\
8:29\
contrive roadblocks\
to prevent you\
8:32\
from understanding the spiritual\
gifts with which you have been\
8:36\
and can be blessed.\
8:41\
Unfortunately, some roadblocks\
may be the result of another's\
8:46\
misbehavior.\
8:47\
It grieves me to think that any\
of you have felt marginalized\
8:54\
or have not been believed\
by a priesthood leader\
8:58\
or have been abused or\
betrayed by a husband, father,\
9:01\
or a supposed friend.\
9:05\
I feel deep sorrow\
that any of you\
9:08\
have felt sidelined,\
disrespected, or misjudged.\
9:13\
Such offenses have no place\
in the kingdom of God.\
9:20\
Conversely, it thrills\
me when I learn\
9:22\
of priesthood\
leaders that eagerly\
9:24\
seek the participation of women\
in ward and stake councils.\
9:30\
I am inspired by\
each husband who\
9:33\
demonstrates that his\
most important priesthood\
9:36\
responsibility is to\
care for his wife.\
9:41\
I praise that man who deeply\
respects his wife's ability\
9:46\
to receive revelation\
and he treasures her\
9:50\
as an equal partner\
in their marriage.\
9:56\
When a man understands\
the majesty and power\
9:59\
of a righteous, seeking,\
endowed Latter-day Saint woman,\
10:03\
is it any wonder that\
he feels like standing\
10:07\
when she enters the room?\
10:11\
From the dawning of time, women\
have been blessed with a unique\
10:15\
moral compass--the ability to\
distinguish right from wrong.\
10:22\
This gift is enhanced in those\
who make and keep covenants.\
10:28\
And it diminishes in\
those who willfully\
10:31\
ignore the commandments of God.\
10:35\
I hasten to add that\
I do not absolve men\
10:38\
in any way from\
God's requirement\
10:40\
for them also to distinguish\
between right and wrong.\
10:43\
But my dear sisters,\
your ability\
10:48\
to discern truth\
from error, to be\
10:51\
society's guardians\
of morality, is\
10:55\
crucial in these latter days.\
11:00\
As we depend upon you to\
teach others to do likewise,\
11:04\
let me be very clear\
about this: if the world\
11:09\
loses the moral\
rectitude of its women,\
11:12\
the world will never recover.\
11:19\
We Latter-day Saints\
are not of the world;\
11:22\
we are of covenant Israel.\
11:25\
We are called to prepare\
a people for the Second\
11:28\
Coming of the Lord.\
11:33\
Now may I clarify several\
additional points with respect\
11:36\
to women and priesthood.\
11:39\
When you are set apart to\
serve in a calling under\
11:42\
the direction of one who\
holds priesthood keys--such\
11:46\
as your bishop or stake\
president--you are given\
11:50\
priesthood authority to\
function in that calling.\
11:56\
Similarly, in the\
holy temple, you\
11:58\
are authorized to\
perform and officiate\
12:01\
in priesthood ordinances\
every time you attend.\
12:05\
Your temple endowment\
prepares you to do so.\
12:12\
If you are endowed but\
not currently married\
12:14\
to a man who bears the\
priesthood and someone says\
12:18\
to you, "I'm sorry\
you don't have\
12:21\
the priesthood in\
your home," please\
12:24\
understand that\
statement is incorrect.\
12:27\
You may not have a\
priesthood-bearer in your home,\
12:31\
but you have received and\
made sacred covenants with God\
12:35\
in His temple.\
12:36\
From those covenants\
flows an endowment\
12:40\
of His priesthood\
power upon you.\
12:45\
And remember, if your\
husband should die,\
12:47\
you would preside in your home.\
12:53\
As a righteous, endowed\
Latter-day Saint woman,\
12:57\
you speak and teach with\
power and authority from God.\
13:03\
Whether by exhortation\
or conversation,\
13:07\
we need your voice teaching\
the doctrine of Christ.\
13:12\
We need your input in family,\
ward, and stake councils.\
13:17\
Your participation is\
essential and never ornamental!\
13:25\
My dear sisters, your power will\
increase as you serve others.\
13:31\
Your prayers, fasting,\
time in the scriptures,\
13:35\
service in the temple,\
family history work\
13:39\
will open the heavens to you.\
13:43\
I entreat you to\
study prayerfully\
13:46\
all the truths you can find\
about priesthood power.\
13:50\
You might begin with Doctrine\
and Covenants sections\
13:55\
84 and 107.\
13:59\
Those sections will lead\
you to other passages.\
14:03\
The scriptures and teachings\
by modern prophets, seers,\
14:06\
and revelators are\
filled with these truths.\
14:11\
As your understanding increases\
and as you exercise faith\
14:16\
in the Lord's priesthood\
power and the Lord Himself,\
14:21\
your ability to draw upon\
this spiritual treasure\
14:25\
that the Lord has made\
available will increase.\
14:30\
As you do so, you\
will find yourselves\
14:33\
better able to help create\
eternal families that\
14:36\
are united, sealed in the temple\
of the Lord, and full of love\
14:39\
for our Heavenly Father\
and Jesus Christ.\
14:44\
All our efforts to\
minister to each other,\
14:46\
proclaim the gospel,\
perfect the Saints,\
14:49\
and redeem the dead--they all\
converge in the holy temple.\
14:56\
We now have 166 temples\
throughout the world,\
14:59\
and more are coming.\
15:04\
As you know, the Salt Lake\
Temple, Temple Square,\
15:08\
and the adjoining plaza near\
the Church Office Building\
15:11\
will be renewed in a\
project that will begin\
15:13\
at the close of this year.\
15:15\
This sacred temple must\
be preserved and prepared\
15:19\
to inspire future generations,\
just as it has influenced us\
15:24\
in this generation.\
15:29\
As the Church\
grows, more temples\
15:31\
will be built so that more\
families can have access\
15:34\
to that greatest of\
all blessings, that\
15:38\
of eternal life.\
15:39\
We regard a temple as the most\
sacred structure in the Church.\
15:46\
Whenever plans are announced\
to construct a new temple,\
15:49\
it becomes an important\
part of our history.\
15:54\
As we have discussed\
here tonight,\
15:55\
you sisters are vital to\
the work of the temple,\
15:58\
and the temple is where you\
will receive your highest\
16:02\
spiritual treasures.\
16:08\
Please listen carefully\
and reverently\
16:13\
as I will now announce plans\
to build eight new temples.\
16:22\
If one is announced in a place\
that is meaningful to you,\
16:24\
I suggest that you simply\
bow your head prayerfully\
16:27\
with gratitude in your heart.\
16:33\
We are pleased to announce\
plans to construct\
16:35\
temples in the\
following locations:\
16:39\
Freetown, Sierra Leone; Orem,\
Utah; Port Moresby, Papua New\
16:49\
Guinea; Bentonville, Arkansas;\
Bacolod, Philippines; McAllen,\
16:59\
Texas; Coban, Guatemala;\
Taylorsville, Utah.\
17:10\
Thank you, dear sisters.\
17:12\
We deeply appreciate\
your receipt\
17:16\
of these plans and\
your reverent response.\
17:18\
Now in closing, I would like\
to leave a blessing upon you,\
17:25\
that you may understand the\
priesthood power with which you\
17:28\
have been endowed and\
that you will augment\
17:32\
that power by exercising\
your faith in the Lord\
17:35\
and in His power.\
17:39\
Dear sisters, with deep\
respect and gratitude,\
17:43\
I express my love for you.\
17:47\
Humbly, I declare\
that God lives!\
17:49\
Jesus is the Christ.\
17:51\
This is His Church.\
17:52\
I so testify in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
