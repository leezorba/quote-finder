leaders throughout the world in addition\
to answering those questions honestly it\
5:37\
is understood that each adult temple\
patron will wear the sacred garment of\
5:43\
the priesthood under the regular\
clothing this is symbolic of an inner\
5:48\
commitment to strive each day to become\
more like the Lord it also reminds us to\
5:54\

day and to walk on the covenant path\

enter the Lord's house requires much\
6:33\
individual spiritual preparation\
but with the Lord's help nothing is\
6:38\
impossible in some respects it is easier\
to build a temple than it is to build a\
6:44\
people prepared for a temple individual\
