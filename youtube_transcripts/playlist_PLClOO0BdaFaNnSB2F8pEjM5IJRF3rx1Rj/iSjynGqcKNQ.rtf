Dear brothers and sisters,\
as we close this session,\
0:05\
may we each hold in our\
hearts the witness borne today\
0:10\
of the truths of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
0:13\
We are blessed to have\
this sacred time together\
0:17\
to reinforce our promise\
to the Lord Jesus Christ\
0:21\
that we are His servants\
and He is our Savior.\
0:26\
The importance of making and\
keeping promises and covenants\
0:31\
weighs heavy on my mind.\
0:34\
How important is it to\
you to keep your word?\
0:38\
To be trusted?\
0:39\
To do what you say you will do?\
0:42\
To strive to honor\
your sacred covenants?\
0:45\
To have integrity?\
0:48\
By living true to our promises\
to the Lord and to others,\
0:52\
we walk the covenant path\
back to our Father in Heaven\
0:56\
and we feel His\
love in our lives.\
1:01\
Our Savior, Jesus Christ,\
is our great Exemplar\
1:04\
when it comes to making and\
keeping promises and covenants.\
1:09\
He came to earth promising\
to do the will of the Father.\
1:13\
He taught gospel principles\
in word and in deed.\
1:18\
He atoned for our sins\
that we might live again.\
1:22\
He has honored every\
one of His promises.\
1:27\
Can the same be\
said of each of us?\
1:30\
What are the dangers if we\
cheat a little, slip a little,\
1:34\
or do not quite follow\
through with our commitments?\
1:39\
What if we walk away\
from our covenants?\
1:42\
Will others come unto Christ\
in light of our example?\
1:47\
Is your word your bond?\
1:50\
Keeping promises\
is not a habit; it\
1:54\
is a characteristic of being\
a disciple of Jesus Christ.\
2:00\
Ever mindful of our\
frailties in mortal life,\
2:03\
the Lord promised,\
"Be of good cheer,\
2:07\
and do not fear, for I\
the Lord am with you,\
2:10\
and will stand by you."\
2:12\
I have felt His presence when\
needing reassurance, comfort,\
2:18\
greater spiritual\
insight or strength,\
2:21\
and I have been\
deeply humbled and am\
2:24\
grateful for His\
divine companionship.\
2:28\
The Lord has said, "Every\
soul who forsaketh his sins\
2:32\
and cometh unto me,\
and calleth on my name,\
2:36\
and obeyeth my voice, and\
keepeth my commandments,\
2:41\
shall see my face\
and know that I am."\
2:45\
That is perhaps His\
ultimate promise.\
2:50\
I learned the importance of\
keeping my word in my youth.\
2:54\
One such example is when\
I stood at attention\
2:58\
to recite the Scout Oath.\
3:00\
Our association with the\
Boy Scouts of America,\
3:04\
as it now concludes, will\
always be an important legacy\
3:09\
to me and this Church.\
3:11\
To the Scouting organization, to\
the scores of men and women who\
3:16\
have served diligently\
as Scout leaders,\
3:19\
to the moms--real\
credit goes there,\
3:22\
you know--and to the young\
men who have participated\
3:27\
in Scouting, we\
say, "Thank you."\
3:31\
In this very session, our dear\
prophet, President Nelson,\
3:35\
and Elder Cook have\
announced adjustments\
3:38\
that will refocus our\
attention on youth\
3:41\
and align our organizations\
with revealed truth.\
3:45\
In addition, just last Sunday,\
President Nelson and President\
3:49\
Ballard explained the\
new "Children and Youth"\
3:53\
of The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints program\
3:57\
for the entire Church.\
3:59\
It is a worldwide initiative\
focused on our Lord and Savior,\
4:04\
Jesus Christ.\
4:06\
The First Presidency and\
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles\
4:10\
are unified in\
this new direction,\
4:12\
and I personally bear my\
witness that the Lord has guided\
4:17\
us every step of the way.\
4:20\
I am excited for the children\
and youth of the Church\
4:23\
to experience this integrated\
focus on them both at home\
4:28\
and at church--through\
gospel learning,\
4:31\
service and activities,\
and personal development.\
4:37\
The youth theme for\
this coming year,\
4:39\
2020, speaks of Nephi's\
classic promise to "go and do."\
4:45\
He wrote: "And it came to\
pass that I, Nephi, said\
4:50\
unto my father: I will go and do\
the things which the Lord hath\
4:54\
commanded, for I know that the\
Lord giveth no commandments\
4:58\
unto the children of men,\
save he shall prepare\
5:02\
a way for them that they may\
accomplish the thing which\
5:05\
he commandeth them."\
5:07\
Although uttered long\
ago, we in the Church\
5:12\
stand on that promise today.\
5:16\
To "go and do" means rising\
above the ways of the world,\
5:19\
receiving and acting\
on personal revelation,\
5:23\
living righteously with hope\
and faith in the future,\
5:27\
making and keeping covenants\
to follow Jesus Christ,\
5:31\
and thereby increasing\
our love for Him,\
5:35\
the Savior of the world.\
5:39\
A covenant is a two-way promise\
between us and the Lord.\
5:43\
As members of the Church\
we covenant at baptism\
5:47\
to take upon us the\
name of Jesus Christ,\
5:50\
to live as He lived.\
5:52\
Like those baptized at\
the Waters of Mormon,\
5:55\
we covenant to\
become His people,\
5:58\
"to bear one another's burdens,\
that they may be light; ...\
6:02\
to mourn with those\
that mourn; ...\
6:04\
comfort those that stand\
in need of comfort,\
6:07\
and to stand as witnesses of God\
at all times and in all things,\
6:13\
and in all places."\
6:15\
Our ministering one to\
another in the Church\
6:19\
reflects our commitment to\
honor those very promises.\
6:25\
When we partake\
of the sacrament,\
6:27\
we renew that covenant\
to take upon us His name\
6:30\
and make additional\
promises to improve.\
6:34\
Our daily thoughts and\
actions, both large and small,\
6:38\
reflect our commitment to Him.\
6:41\
His sacred promise in return\
is "If ye do always remember me\
6:47\
ye shall have my\
Spirit to be with you."\
6:52\
My question today is Do we stand\
by our promises and covenants,\
6:58\
or are they sometimes\
half-hearted commitments,\
7:02\
casually made and,\
hence, easily broken?\
7:06\
When we say to someone, "I\
will pray for you," do we?\
7:11\
When we commit, "I will be\
there to help," will we?\
7:15\
When we obligate ourselves\
to pay a debt, do we?\
7:20\
When we raise our hands\
to sustain a fellow member\
7:24\
in a new calling, which\
means "give support," do we?\
7:30\
One evening in my\
youth, my mother\
7:33\
sat with me at the\
foot of her bed\
7:35\
and spoke fervently\
of the importance\
7:38\
of living the Word of Wisdom.\
7:40\
"I know from the experiences\
of others, from years ago,"\
7:44\
she said, "the loss of\
spirituality and sensitivity\
7:49\
that comes from not following\
the Word of Wisdom."\
7:53\
She looked right\
into my eyes and I\
7:57\
felt her words penetrate my\
heart: "Promise me, Ronnie,\
8:02\
today (she called me\
Ronnie), that you will always\
8:07\
live the Word of Wisdom."\
8:10\
I solemnly made\
that promise to her,\
8:14\
and I have held to\
it all these years.\
8:17\
That commitment served me\
well when I was in my youth\
8:21\
and in later years when\
I was in business circles\
8:25\
where substances flowed freely.\
8:28\
I made a decision in advance\
to follow God's laws,\
8:32\
and I never had to revisit it.\
8:35\
The Lord has said, "I, the Lord,\
am bound when ye do what I say;\
8:41\
but when ye do not what I\
say, ye have no promise."\
8:46\
What is He saying to those who\
abide by the Word of Wisdom?\
8:50\
That we will have the promise\
of health, strength, wisdom,\
8:55\
knowledge, and\
angels to protect us.\
9:01\
Some years ago,\
Sister Rasband and I\
9:03\
were at the Salt Lake\
Temple for the sealing\
9:06\
of one of our daughters.\
9:07\
As we stood outside the\
temple with a younger daughter\
9:11\
not yet old enough to\
attend the ceremony,\
9:14\
we spoke of the\
importance of being sealed\
9:17\
in the holy temple of God.\
9:19\
As my mother had\
taught me years before,\
9:22\
we said to our daughter,\
"We want you safely\
9:26\
sealed in the\
temple, and we want\
9:29\
you to promise us that when you\
find your eternal companion,\
9:33\
you will make a date with him\
to be sealed in the temple."\
9:38\
She gave us her word.\
9:41\
She has since stated that\
our talk and her promise\
9:45\
protected her and reminded\
her "what was most important."\
9:50\
She later made sacred\
covenants as she was sealed\
9:53\
to her husband in the temple.\
9:58\
President Nelson\
has taught, "We ...\
10:00\
increase the Savior's power in\
our lives when we make sacred\
10:05\
covenants and keep those\
covenants with precision.\
10:10\
Our covenants bind us to Him\
and give us godly power."\
10:16\
When we keep promises\
to one another,\
10:19\
we are more likely to\
keep promises to the Lord.\
10:22\
Remember the Lord's\
words: "Inasmuch as ye\
10:26\
have done it unto one of the\
least of these my brethren,\
10:29\
ye have done it unto me."\
10:32\
Reflect with me on examples\
of promises in the scriptures.\
10:37\
Ammon and the sons of\
Mosiah in the Book of Mormon\
10:41\
committed "to preach\
the word of God."\
10:44\
When Ammon was captured\
by Lamanite forces,\
10:48\
he was taken before the\
Lamanite king Lamoni.\
10:51\
He committed to the king,\
"I will be thy servant."\
10:57\
When raiders came to\
steal the king's sheep,\
11:00\
Ammon cut off their arms.\
11:02\
So astonished was\
the king, he listened\
11:06\
to Ammon's message of the\
gospel and was converted.\
11:11\
Ruth, in the Old Testament,\
promised her mother-in-law,\
11:15\
"Whither thou goest, I will go."\
11:18\
She lived true to her word.\
11:21\
The good Samaritan, in a\
parable in the New Testament,\
11:25\
promised the innkeeper he would\
care for the injured traveler:\
11:30\
"Whatsoever thou\
spendest more, when I\
11:33\
come again, I will repay thee."\
11:37\
Zoram, in the Book\
of Mormon, promised\
11:40\
to go into the wilderness\
with Nephi and his brothers.\
11:44\
Nephi recounted, "When Zoram\
had made an oath unto us,\
11:49\
our fears did cease\
concerning him."\
11:54\
What of the ancient promise\
"made to the fathers"\
11:57\
as described in the\
scriptures that "the hearts\
12:00\
of the children shall\
turn to their fathers"?\
12:03\
In the pre-earth life,\
when we chose God's plan,\
12:07\
we made a promise to\
help gather Israel\
12:11\
on both sides of the veil.\
12:15\
"We went into a\
partnership with the Lord,"\
12:18\
Elder John A. Widtsoe\
explained years later.\
12:22\
"The working out of\
the plan became then\
12:25\
not merely the Father's\
work, and the Savior's work,\
12:29\
but also our work."\
12:34\
"[The] gathering is the most\
important thing taking place\
12:37\
on [the] earth today," President\
Nelson has said as he has\
12:42\
traveled throughout the world.\
12:44\
"When we speak of\
the gathering, we\
12:46\
are simply saying this\
fundamental truth:\
12:50\
every one of our Heavenly\
Father's children,\
12:53\
on both sides of\
the veil, deserves\
12:56\
to hear the message\
of the restored\
12:59\
gospel of Jesus Christ."\
13:04\
As an Apostle of the\
Lord Jesus Christ,\
13:07\
I conclude with an\
invitation and promise.\
13:12\
First, the invitation: I invite\
you to consider the promises\
13:18\
and covenants you make with\
the Lord, and with others,\
13:22\
with great integrity, knowing\
that your word is your bond.\
13:32\
Second, I promise\
you, as you do this,\
13:35\
the Lord will\
establish your words\
13:39\
and sanction your deeds as you\
strive with unwearied diligence\
13:44\
to build up your\
lives, your families,\
13:48\
and The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
13:52\
He will be with you, my\
dear brothers and sisters,\
13:56\
and you can, with confidence,\
look forward to being "received\
14:01\
into heaven, that thereby [you]\
may dwell with God in a state\
14:07\
of never-ending happiness ...\
for the Lord God hath spoken\
14:12\
it."\
14:13\
Of this I testify and promise in\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
