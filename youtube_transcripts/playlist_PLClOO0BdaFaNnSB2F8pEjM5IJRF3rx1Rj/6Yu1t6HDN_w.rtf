In 2016 the Tabernacle\
Choir at Temple Square\
0:04\
came to visit the\
Netherlands and Belgium.\
0:07\
And since I was involved\
in that exciting event,\
0:10\
I had the opportunity to\
enjoy their performance twice.\
0:14\
During their performance\
I was thinking\
0:16\
about what a tremendous\
undertaking it\
0:18\
was to move a\
choir of that size.\
0:23\
My mind was drawn to\
the big gong, which\
0:26\
was difficult and probably\
costly to ship over\
0:29\
in comparison with the\
violin, the trumpet,\
0:32\
or other instruments you could\
easily carry under your arm.\
0:35\
But looking at the actual\
involvement of this gong,\
0:39\
it was only hit a few times,\
whereas the other, smaller\
0:42\
instruments were involved\
for most of the concert.\
0:46\
I reflected that without\
the sound of the gong,\
0:49\
the performance would\
not be the same,\
0:51\
and so the effort had to be\
made to move this big gong all\
0:55\
the way across the ocean.\
0:58\
Sometimes we might feel\
that we are, like that gong,\
1:01\
only good enough to play a\
minor part in the performance.\
1:05\
But let me tell you\
that your sound is\
1:08\
making all the difference.\
1:10\
We need all instruments.\
1:11\
Some of us learn\
easily and do very well\
1:14\
in school, while others\
have artistic talents.\
1:17\
Some design and build\
things or nurse,\
1:20\
protect, or teach others.\
1:22\
We are all needed to bring\
color and meaning to this world.\
1:26\
To those who feel they\
do not have anything\
1:29\
to contribute or believe that\
they are of no importance\
1:33\
or consequence to anybody,\
to others that might feel\
1:37\
that they are on top of the\
world, and anybody in between,\
1:41\
I would like to\
address this message.\
1:44\
Wherever you are on the\
path of life, some of you\
1:48\
might feel so overburdened\
that you do not even\
1:51\
consider yourself on that path.\
1:53\
I want to invite you to step out\
of the darkness into the light.\
1:58\
The gospel light will\
provide warmth and healing\
2:01\
and will help you understand\
who you really are\
2:04\
and what your\
purpose in life is.\
2:08\
Some of us have been\
wandering on forbidden paths,\
2:10\
trying to find happiness there.\
2:13\
We are invited by a\
loving Heavenly Father\
2:15\
to walk the path of discipleship\
and to return to Him.\
2:20\
He loves us with a perfect love.\
2:23\
What is the way?\
2:24\
The way is to help each\
other understand who we are\
2:28\
by ministering to each other.\
2:31\
To me, ministering is\
exercising divine love.\
2:34\
In that way, we\
create an environment\
2:37\
where both the giver\
and the receiver\
2:39\
obtain a desire to repent.\
2:42\
In other words, we change\
direction and come closer to\
2:46\
and become more like our\
Savior, Jesus Christ.\
2:50\
For instance, there is no need\
to constantly tell our spouse\
2:53\
or children how\
they can improve;\
2:55\
they know that already.\
2:57\
It is in creating this\
environment of love\
2:59\
that they will be\
empowered to make\
3:02\
the necessary changes in their\
lives and become better people.\
3:06\
In this way repentance becomes\
a daily process of refining\
3:11\
that might include\
apologizing for poor behavior.\
3:14\
I remember and still\
experience situations\
3:18\
where I have been too quick to\
judge or too slow to listen.\
3:21\
And at the end of the day,\
during my personal prayer,\
3:25\
I felt loving\
counsel from heaven\
3:27\
to repent and to become better.\
3:30\
The loving environment first\
created by my parents, brother,\
3:34\
and sisters and later by my\
wife, children, and friends\
3:39\
has helped me to\
become a better person.\
3:42\
We all know where\
we can do better.\
3:44\
There is no need to\
repeatedly remind each other,\
3:47\
but there is a need to love\
and minister to each other\
3:51\
and in doing so provide\
a climate of willingness\
3:54\
to change.\
3:56\
In this same environment, we\
are learning who we really are\
3:59\
and what our role will\
be in this last chapter\
4:02\
of the world's history\
prior to the Second\
4:05\
Coming of the Savior.\
4:07\
If you are wondering\
about your part,\
4:09\
I would like to invite\
you to find a place where\
4:13\
you can be alone and ask\
Heavenly Father to make known\
4:17\
to you which part to play.\
4:19\
The answer will probably\
come gradually and then\
4:23\
more clearly when we have\
set our feet more firmly\
4:26\
on the covenant and\
ministering path.\
4:30\
We are experiencing some\
of the same difficulties\
4:33\
that Joseph Smith\
confronted while he\
4:36\
was in the midst of a war of\
words and tumult of opinions.\
4:41\
As we read in his\
own account, he often\
4:44\
said to himself:\
"What is to be done?\
4:47\
Who of all these parties are\
right; or, are they all wrong\
4:51\
together?\
4:52\
If any one of them be\
right, which [one] is it,\
4:55\
and how shall I know it?"\
4:58\
With the knowledge he found\
in the Epistle of James, which\
5:01\
states, "If any of\
you lack wisdom,\
5:04\
let him ask of God, that\
giveth to all men liberally,\
5:08\
and upbraideth not; and it shall\
be given him," Joseph at length\
5:14\
came to the determination\
to "ask of God."\
5:17\
We further read that it was\
the first time in his life\
5:21\
that he had made such\
an attempt, for, amidst\
5:24\
all his anxieties,\
he had never, as yet,\
5:27\
made the attempt\
to pray vocally.\
5:30\
And so it can be for\
us the very first time\
5:33\
we address our Maker in a way\
that we have never done before.\
5:38\
Because of Joseph's attempt,\
Heavenly Father and His Son,\
5:42\
Jesus Christ, appeared to\
him, calling him by name;\
5:45\
and as a result, we have a\
much clearer understanding\
5:48\
of who we are and that\
we really do matter.\
5:54\
We further read that in\
his tender teenage years,\
5:57\
Joseph was persecuted\
by those who\
6:00\
ought to have been his\
friends and who were supposed\
6:03\
to have treated him kindly.\
6:05\
And so we might\
expect some opposition\
6:07\
as we are living a\
life of discipleship.\
6:11\
If you currently\
feel you are not\
6:13\
able to be part of the orchestra\
and the path of repentance\
6:17\
appears difficult to you, please\
know that if we keep at it,\
6:22\
the burden will be\
taken from our shoulders\
6:24\
and there will be light again.\
6:26\
Heavenly Father will never\
leave us when we reach for Him.\
6:30\
We can fall and get up, and\
He will help us brush off\
6:33\
the dirt from our knees.\
6:35\
Some of us are wounded, but\
the first aid kit of the Lord\
6:39\
has bandages big enough to\
cover all of our wounds.\
6:44\
So it is that love,\
that perfect love\
6:47\
that we also call charity or\
"the pure love of Christ,"\
6:51\
which is needed in\
our homes, where\
6:53\
parents minister to their\
children and children,\
6:57\
to their parents.\
6:58\
Through that love, hearts\
will be changed and desires\
7:02\
born to do His will.\
7:04\
It is that love that is\
needed in our dealings\
7:06\
with each other as children\
of our Heavenly Father\
7:10\
and as members of His Church\
that will enable us to include\
7:14\
all the musical instruments\
in our orchestras\
7:17\
so we will be able\
to perform gloriously\
7:20\
with the angelic\
choirs of heaven\
7:22\
when the Savior comes again.\
7:24\
It is that love, that light\
that needs to shine and brighten\
7:29\
our surroundings as we\
go about our daily lives.\
7:33\
People will notice the light\
and will be drawn to it.\
7:37\
That is the kind of\
missionary work that\
7:39\
will draw others to "come\
and see," "come and help,"\
7:42\
and "come and stay."\
7:44\
Please, when you have\
received your witness\
7:48\
about this great\
work and our part\
7:51\
in it, let us rejoice together\
with our beloved Prophet Joseph\
7:56\
Smith, who declared, "For I\
had seen a vision; I knew it,\
8:01\
and I knew that God knew it,\
and I could not deny it."\
8:06\
I testify to you\
that I know who I am,\
8:09\
and I do know who you are.\
8:11\
We are all children of a\
Heavenly Father who loves us.\
8:15\
And He did not send us here to\
fail but to return gloriously\
8:19\
to Him.\
8:20\
That we may all\
come to understand\
8:22\
our part in this\
great ministering work\
8:25\
so that we will become more\
like Him when He comes again\
8:29\
is my prayer in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
