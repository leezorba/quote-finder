Today I offer words of\
counsel for everyone,\
0:04\
but especially for you of the\
rising generation--Primary\
0:09\
children, young men,\
and young women.\
0:11\
You are deeply loved by the\
Lord's prophet for our day,\
0:15\
President Russell M. Nelson--so\
much so that he spoke to many\
0:19\
of you last year in a special\
worldwide youth devotional\
0:24\
broadcast titled\
"Hope of Israel."\
0:30\
We often hear, as\
we did yesterday,\
0:32\
President Nelson calling\
you exactly that--the "hope\
0:35\
of Israel," the\
rising generation,\
0:39\
and the future of the restored\
Church of Jesus Christ.\
0:43\
My young friends, I\
would like to begin\
0:45\
by sharing two family stories.\
0:49\
Years ago I arrived home from\
work and was startled to see\
0:53\
white paint splattered\
everywhere--on the ground,\
0:56\
the garage door, and\
our redbrick house.\
1:00\
I inspected the\
scene more closely\
1:02\
and discovered the\
paint was still wet.\
1:05\
A trail of paint led towards\
the backyard, so I followed it.\
1:09\
There I found my\
five-year-old son\
1:12\
with a paintbrush in his\
hand, chasing our dog.\
1:16\
Our beautiful black Labrador was\
splattered almost half white!\
1:23\
"What are you doing?"\
1:24\
I asked in an animated voice.\
1:26\
My son stopped, looked\
at me, looked at the dog,\
1:31\
looked at the paintbrush\
dripping with paint, and said,\
1:34\
"I just want him to look\
like the black-spotted dogs\
1:38\
in the movie--you know, the\
one with the 101 Dalmatians."\
1:46\
I loved our dog.\
1:47\
I thought he was perfect,\
but that day my son\
1:51\
had a different idea.\
1:55\
My second story centers\
around Great-Uncle Grover,\
2:00\
who lived in a house in the\
country, far from the city.\
2:03\
Uncle Grover was\
getting very old.\
2:06\
We thought our sons should\
meet him before he died.\
2:09\
So one afternoon we took a\
long drive to his humble house.\
2:13\
We sat together to visit and\
introduce him to our sons.\
2:17\
Not long into the\
conversation, our two boys,\
2:20\
maybe five and six years old,\
wanted to go outside and play.\
2:25\
Uncle Grover, hearing\
their request,\
2:27\
bent over with his\
face in theirs.\
2:30\
His face was so weathered\
and unfamiliar that the boys\
2:34\
were a little scared of him.\
2:36\
He said to them in\
his gravelly voice,\
2:39\
"Be careful--there are a\
lot of skunks out there."\
2:44\
Hearing this, Lesa and I\
were more than startled;\
2:47\
we were worried that they\
might get sprayed by a skunk!\
2:51\
The boys soon went outside to\
play as we continued to visit.\
2:56\
Later, when we got in\
the car to go home,\
2:58\
I inquired of the boys,\
"Did you see a skunk?"\
3:03\
One of them replied, "No,\
we didn't see any skunks,\
3:08\
but we did see a black kitty\
cat with a white stripe\
3:13\
on [his] back!"\
3:17\
Well, these stories about\
innocent children discovering\
3:19\
something about life and\
reality may make each of us\
3:23\
smile, but they also illustrate\
a more profound concept.\
3:28\
In the first story,\
our young son\
3:30\
had a beautiful dog as a\
pet; notwithstanding, he\
3:33\
grabbed a gallon of paint\
and, with paintbrush in hand,\
3:37\
determined to create his\
own imagined reality.\
3:42\
In the second\
account, the boys were\
3:44\
blissfully unaware of\
the unsavory threat\
3:48\
that they faced from a skunk.\
3:50\
Unable to properly identify what\
they had actually encountered,\
3:55\
they ran the risk of suffering\
some unfortunate consequences.\
4:00\
Stories of mistaken\
identity--presuming the real\
4:04\
thing to be something else.\
4:05\
In each case the\
consequences were minor.\
4:09\
However, today many grapple\
with these same issues\
4:13\
on a much larger scale.\
4:15\
They are either\
unable to see things\
4:18\
as they truly are or are\
unsatisfied with truth.\
4:21\
Moreover, there are forces\
at play today designed\
4:25\
to deliberately lead us\
away from absolute truth.\
4:29\
These deceptions and lies go\
far beyond innocent mistaken\
4:32\
identity and often have dire,\
not minor, consequences.\
4:38\
Satan, the father of lies\
and the great deceiver,\
4:40\
would have us question\
things as they really are\
4:44\
and either ignore eternal truths\
or replace them with something\
4:50\
that appears more pleasing.\
4:53\
"He maketh war with\
the saints of God"\
4:56\
and has spent millennia\
calculating and practicing\
5:00\
the ability to persuade God's\
children to believe that good\
5:05\
is evil and evil is good.\
5:09\
He has made a\
reputation for himself,\
5:11\
convincing mortals that\
skunks are just kittens\
5:13\
or that, with an\
application of paint,\
5:16\
you can turn a Labrador\
into a Dalmatian!\
5:20\
Let's now turn to an example\
of this very principle found\
5:23\
in the scriptures, when the\
Lord's prophet Moses came face\
5:27\
to face with this same issue.\
5:29\
"Moses was caught up into an\
exceedingly high mountain, ...\
5:33\
he saw God face to face,\
and he talked with him."\
5:37\
God taught Moses about\
his eternal identity.\
5:40\
Though Moses was\
mortal and imperfect,\
5:43\
God taught that Moses was "in\
the similitude of mine Only\
5:48\
Begotten; and mine Only Begotten\
... shall be the Savior."\
5:52\
To summarize, in this marvelous\
vision, Moses beheld God,\
5:57\
and he also learned something\
important about himself:\
6:00\
he was indeed a son of God.\
6:05\
Listen carefully\
to what happened\
6:07\
as this wondrous vision closed.\
6:09\
"And it came to pass, that ...\
6:11\
Satan came tempting him,"\
saying, "Moses, son of man,\
6:14\
worship me!"\
6:16\
Moses courageously\
replied: "Who art thou?\
6:20\
For behold, I am a son\
of God, in the similitude\
6:25\
of his Only Begotten;\
and where is thy glory,\
6:29\
that I should worship thee?"\
6:33\
In other words, Moses said,\
"You cannot deceive me,\
6:38\
for I know who I am.\
6:39\
I was created in\
the image of God.\
6:42\
You don't have His\
light and glory.\
6:44\
So why should I worship you or\
fall prey to your deception?"\
6:51\
Now pay attention to how\
Moses further responds.\
6:54\
He declares, "Get thee hence,\
Satan; deceive me not."\
7:03\
There is much we can learn\
from Moses's mighty response\
7:07\
to temptation from\
the adversary.\
7:10\
I invite you to respond\
the same way when you\
7:13\
feel influenced by temptation.\
7:16\
Command the enemy of your\
soul by saying, "Go away!\
7:22\
You have no glory.\
7:24\
Do not tempt me, or lie to me!\
7:27\
For I know I am a child of God.\
7:29\
And I will always call\
upon my God for His help."\
7:34\
The adversary, however,\
does not easily\
7:36\
abandon his destructive motives\
to deceive and demean us.\
7:40\
He certainly did not\
do so with Moses,\
7:42\
instead desiring Moses to\
forget who he was eternally.\
7:50\
As if he were throwing\
a childish tantrum,\
7:53\
"Satan cried with a loud voice,\
and ranted upon the earth,\
7:57\
and commanded, saying: I am\
the Only Begotten, worship me."\
8:03\
Let's review.\
8:04\
Did you hear what he just said?\
8:05\
"I am the Only\
Begotten, worship me."\
8:09\
The great deceiver said,\
in effect, "Don't worry;\
8:13\
I won't harm you.\
8:14\
I'm not a skunk; I am just\
an innocent black-and-white\
8:17\
striped kitty cat."\
8:19\
Moses then called upon God and\
received His divine strength.\
8:22\
Even though the adversary\
trembled and the earth shook,\
8:25\
Moses did not yield.\
8:27\
His voice was certain and clear.\
8:29\
"Depart from me, Satan,"\
he declared, "for this one\
8:33\
God only will I worship,\
which is the God of glory."\
8:37\
Finally, he "departed ...\
from the presence of Moses."\
8:41\
Following this, the Lord\
appeared and blessed Moses\
8:44\
for his obedience, saying:\
8:46\
"Blessed art thou,\
Moses, for ...\
8:47\
thou shalt be made\
stronger than many waters.\
8:50\
...\
8:51\
"And lo, I am with thee, even\
unto the end of thy days."\
8:55\
Moses's resistance\
of the adversary\
8:57\
is a vivid and enlightening\
example for each of us,\
9:00\
no matter our stage in life.\
9:02\
It is a powerful message for you\
personally--to know what to do\
9:07\
when he tries to deceive you.\
9:09\
For you, like Moses,\
have been blessed\
9:12\
with the gift of heavenly help.\
9:15\
How might you find this heavenly\
help, even as Moses did,\
9:18\
and be not deceived or\
give in to temptation?\
9:22\
A clear channel for\
divine assistance\
9:24\
was reaffirmed in\
this dispensation\
9:27\
by the Lord Himself\
when He declared:\
9:30\
"Wherefore, I the Lord,\
knowing the calamity which\
9:33\
should come upon the\
inhabitants of the earth, called\
9:36\
upon my servant\
Joseph Smith, Jun.,\
9:38\
and spake unto him from heaven,\
and gave him commandments."\
9:43\
Using simpler\
words, we might say\
9:46\
that the Lord, who knows\
"the end from the beginning,"\
9:49\
knows the unique\
difficulties of our day.\
9:52\
Therefore, He has\
provided a way for us\
9:55\
to resist challenges and\
temptations, many of which\
9:59\
come as a direct result of\
the deceitful influences\
10:02\
of the adversary\
and his attacks.\
10:05\
The way is simple.\
10:07\
Through His servants, God\
speaks to us, His children,\
10:11\
and gives us commandments.\
10:13\
We could restate the verse\
I just quoted to say,\
10:16\
"I the Lord ... called upon my\
servant [President Russell M.\
10:21\
Nelson], and spake\
unto him from heaven,\
10:24\
and gave him commandments."\
10:26\
Isn't that a glorious truth?\
10:28\
I bear solemn\
witness that the Lord\
10:30\
did in all reality\
speak to Joseph Smith\
10:33\
from heaven, beginning\
with the grand vision.\
10:36\
He also speaks to President\
Nelson in our time.\
10:40\
I testify that God communed\
with prophets in past ages\
10:44\
and gave them\
commandments designed\
10:46\
to lead His children to\
happiness in this life\
10:49\
and glory in the next.\
10:52\
God continues to\
give commandments\
10:54\
to our living prophet today.\
10:56\
Examples abound: a\
more home-centered,\
11:00\
Church-supported balance\
in gospel instruction;\
11:03\
the replacement of\
home and visiting\
11:06\
teaching with\
ministering; adjustments\
11:09\
to temple procedures\
and ordinances;\
11:12\
and the new "Children\
and Youth" program.\
11:15\
I marvel at the goodness and\
compassion of a loving Heavenly\
11:19\
Father and His Son,\
Jesus Christ, who\
11:21\
restored the Savior's\
Church to earth once again\
11:25\
and have called a\
prophet in our day.\
11:28\
The Restoration of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ\
11:31\
offsets perilous times\
with the fulness of times.\
11:38\
Obedience to commandments\
given to our prophet\
11:41\
is a key not only in avoiding\
the influence of the deceiver\
11:45\
but also in experiencing\
lasting joy and happiness.\
11:49\
The divine formula\
is rather simple:\
11:52\
righteousness, or obedience to\
commandments, brings blessings,\
11:57\
and blessings bring happiness,\
or joy, into our lives.\
12:02\
However, in the same way that\
the adversary tried to deceive\
12:05\
Moses, he seeks to trick you.\
12:08\
He has always pretended to\
be something that he is not.\
12:12\
He always attempts to\
hide who he truly is.\
12:15\
He claims that obedience\
will make your life miserable\
12:19\
and that it will rob\
you of happiness.\
12:22\
Can you think of some\
of his ploys to deceive?\
12:26\
For instance, he disguises\
the destructive consequences\
12:30\
of illicit drugs or drinking\
and instead suggests\
12:34\
that it will bring pleasure.\
12:36\
He immerses us in the\
various negative elements\
12:40\
that can exist in\
social media, including\
12:43\
debilitating comparisons\
and idealized reality.\
12:48\
In addition, he camouflages\
other dark, harmful content\
12:53\
found online such\
as pornography,\
12:56\
blatant attacks on others\
through cyberbullying,\
12:59\
and sowing misinformation\
to cause doubt and fear\
13:02\
in our hearts and minds.\
13:04\
Cunningly, he whispers,\
"Just follow me,\
13:07\
and you will surely be happy."\
13:10\
The words written so\
many centuries ago\
13:12\
by a Book of Mormon\
prophet are especially\
13:15\
relevant for our day:\
"Wickedness never\
13:19\
was happiness."\
13:21\
May we recognize Satan's\
deceptions for what they are.\
13:27\
May we withstand and see\
through the lies and influences\
13:31\
of the one who seeks to destroy\
our souls and steal from us\
13:35\
our present joy\
and future glory.\
13:39\
My brothers and sisters,\
we must continue\
13:41\
to be faithful and\
vigilant, for so\
13:44\
is the only way to\
discern truth and to hear\
13:48\
the voice of the Lord\
through His servants.\
13:50\
"For the Spirit speaketh\
the truth and lieth not.\
13:55\
...\
13:55\
These things are\
manifested unto us plainly,\
13:58\
for the salvation of our souls.\
14:01\
...\
14:01\
For God also spake them\
unto prophets of old."\
14:06\
We are the Saints of Almighty\
God, the hope of Israel!\
14:11\
Will we falter?\
14:13\
"Shall we shrink\
or shun the fight?\
14:16\
No!\
14:17\
...\
14:17\
To God's command, soul, heart,\
and hand, faithful and true\
14:23\
we will ever stand."\
14:26\
I bear my witness of\
the Holy One of Israel,\
14:29\
even the name of Jesus Christ.\
14:33\
I testify of His\
abiding love, truth,\
14:35\
and joy that are made\
possible by His infinite\
14:39\
and eternal sacrifice.\
14:41\
As we obey His\
commandments, we will always\
14:44\
be led in the right way\
and will be not deceived.\
14:48\
In the sacred name of our\
Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.\
