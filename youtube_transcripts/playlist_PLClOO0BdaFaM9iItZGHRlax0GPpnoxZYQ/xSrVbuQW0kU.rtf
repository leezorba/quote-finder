let's travel back to a hot afternoon on\
0:05\
July 24th 1847 around 2:00 p.m.\
0:08\
following an arduous 111 day journey\
0:12\
with a hundred and forty-eight members\
0:14\
of the church who comprised the first\
0:16\
party to head west Brigham Young then\
0:19\
president of the quorum of the Twelve\
0:20\
Apostles sick and weak for Mountain\
0:23\
fever entered Salt Lake Valley two days\
0:27\
later while recovering from his illness\
0:29\
Brigham Young led several members of the\
0:31\
quorum of the Twelve Apostles and others\
0:34\
on an exploring expedition William\
0:37\
Clayton recorded about three-quarters of\
0:40\
a mile north of the camp we arrived on a\
0:42\
beautiful table of land level and nicely\
0:45\
sloping to the west while surveying the\
0:49\
spot with the group Brigham Young\
0:50\
suddenly stopped and stuck his cane in\
0:53\
the ground exclaiming here shall stand\
0:56\
the Temple of our God one of his\
0:59\
companions was Wilford Woodruff who said\
1:02\
this statement went through him like\
1:04\
lightning and he drove a branch into the\
1:07\
ground to mark the spot made by\
1:09\
president Young's cane 40 acres were\
1:13\
selected for the temple and it was\
1:14\
decided that the city should be laid out\
1:16\
perfectly square north and south east\
1:19\
and west with the temple being the\
1:22\
center spot at General Conference in\
1:25\
April 1851 members of the church voted\
1:28\
unanimously to sustain a motion to build\
1:32\
a temple to the name of the Lord\
1:34\
two years later the site was dedicated\
1:37\
by Heber C Kimball in a public ceremony\
1:39\
attended by several sat thousand Saints\
1:42\
and ground was broken for the foundation\
1:46\
of the Salt Lake Temple a few months\
1:48\
later on April 6 the massive\
1:50\
cornerstones of the Salt Lake Temple\
1:53\
were laid and dedicated with elaborate\
1:56\
ceremonies that included a color guard\
1:59\
and bands and a procession led by church\
2:03\
leaders from the old Tabernacle to the\
2:06\
temple site where remarks and prayers\
2:09\
were offered at each of the four\
2:11\
cornerstones\
2:13\
at the groundbreaking ceremony president\
2:16\
young recalled that he had seen a vision\
2:17\
when he first set foot upon the ground\
2:20\
as they surveyed the valley floor\
2:22\
stating I knew then just as well as I\
2:25\
now know that this was the ground on\
2:28\
which to erect a temple it was before me\
2:31\
ten years later Brigham Young offered\
2:34\
the following prophetic insight at\
2:36\
General Conference I want to see the\
2:38\
temple built in a manner that it will\
2:40\
endure the Millennium that this is not\
2:44\
the only temple we shall build there\
2:47\
will be hundreds of them built and\
2:48\
dedicated to the Lord this temple will\
2:51\
be known as the first temple built in\
2:53\
the mountains by the latter-day saints\
2:55\
I want that temple to stand as a proud\
2:57\
monument of the faith perseverance and\
3:00\
Industry of the saints of God in the\
3:03\
mountains in reviewing this brief\
3:06\
history I'm in awe of the seer ship of\
3:09\
Brigham Young first his ensuring that to\
3:13\
the extent possible and using\
3:15\
constructed methods available at that\
3:18\
time in place the Salt Lake Temple would\
3:21\
be built in a manner to endure\
3:23\
throughout the millennium and second his\
3:26\
prophesying of the growth of future\
3:28\
temples worldwide even to number them in\
3:31\
the hundreds like Brigham Young our\
3:36\
prophet of today looks over the Salt\
3:39\
Lake Temple and all others with great\
3:41\
care through the years the First\
3:44\
Presidency has from time to time\
3:46\
counseled the presiding bishopric to\
3:49\
ensure that the foundation of the Salt\
3:51\
Lake Temple is solid when I served in\
3:54\
the presiding bishopric at the request\
3:56\
of the First Presidency we did an\
3:59\
overall facility review of the Salt Lake\
4:01\
Temple including an evaluation of the\
4:04\
most recent advancements in seismic\
4:07\
design and construction techniques here\
4:10\
are portions of the review provided to\
4:12\
the first presidency at that time in the\
4:16\
design and construction of the Salt Lake\
4:17\
Temple the best engineering skilled\
4:20\
labor construction materials furnishings\
4:23\
and other period available resources\
4:25\
were used\
4:27\
since its dedication in 1893 the temple\
4:30\
has stood firm and served as a beacon of\
4:32\
faith and hope and is alight unto the\
4:35\
people great care has been taken to\
4:38\
operate clean and maintain the temple in\
4:40\
good condition the granite exterior and\
4:43\
interior floor joists and support beams\
4:45\
are in good condition\
4:47\
recent studies confirm that the location\
4:50\
chosen by Brigham Young for the temple\
4:52\
has very good soils and excellent\
4:54\
excellent compaction qualities the\
4:58\
review concluded that normal repairs and\
5:00\
improvements were needed to renew and\
5:02\
update the temple including the exterior\
5:05\
deck and surface areas\
5:07\
obsolete utility systems and baptistry\
5:10\
areas however consideration of a more\
5:15\
comprehensive seismic upgrade beginning\
5:19\
from the temple foundation on upward was\
5:22\
also recommended as you may recall\
5:25\
Brigham Young himself was involved in\
5:28\
great detail in the construction of the\
5:30\
original temple foundation which has\
5:33\
served the temple well since its\
5:34\
completion a hundred and twenty seven\
5:36\
years ago the newly proposed seismic\
5:40\
upgrade package for the temple would\
5:42\
utilize base isolation technology which\
5:46\
was not even imagined at the time of its\
5:48\
construction this is considered the\
5:51\
latest most state-of-the-art engineering\
5:53\
for earthquake protection this\
5:56\
technology recent in its development\
5:58\
begins at the very foundation of the\
6:00\
temple providing a robust defense\
6:03\
against damage from an earthquake in\
6:07\
essence it structurally strengthens the\
6:10\
temple to stand steadfast even as the\
6:12\
earth and environment around it undergo\
6:16\
an earth-shaking seismic event the\
6:21\
temple renovation that would employ this\
6:23\
technology was announced by the First\
6:25\
Presidency last year under the direction\
6:28\
of the presiding bishopric\
6:29\
construction commenced a few months ago\
6:32\
in January it is estimated to be\
6:36\
completed in approximately four years\
6:40\
as I contemplate the next four years of\
6:43\
the life of this beautiful noble exalted\
6:45\
an awe-inspiring Salt Lake Temple I\
6:47\
envision it more as a time of renewal\
6:50\
rather than a time of closure in a\
6:54\
similar way we might ask ourselves how\
6:57\
could this extensive renewal of the Salt\
6:59\
Lake Temple inspire us to undergo our\
7:02\
own spiritual renewal reconstruction\
7:06\
rebirth revitalization or restoration an\
7:12\
introspective look may reveal that we\
7:14\
too and our families could benefit from\
7:18\
doing some needed maintenance and\
7:20\
renovation work even a seismic upgrade\
7:23\
what might start what what might such a\
7:28\
process start we could begin by asking\
7:32\
what does my foundation look like what\
7:35\
comprises the thick-walled stable strong\
7:38\
cornerstones that are part of my\
7:40\
personal foundation upon which my\
7:43\
testimony rests what are the\
7:46\
foundational elements of my spiritual\
7:48\
and emotional character that will allow\
7:50\
me and my family to remain steadfast and\
7:53\
immovable even to withstand the\
7:56\
earth-shaking and tumultuous seismic\
7:58\
events that will surely take place in\
8:00\
our lives these events similar to an\
8:03\
earthquake are often difficult to\
8:05\
predict and come in a variety of levels\
8:09\
of intensity wrestling with questions or\
8:13\
doubt facing afflictions or adversity\
8:17\
working through personal offenses with\
8:20\
church leaders members doctrine or\
8:23\
policy the death the best defense\
8:26\
against these lie in our spiritual\
8:29\
foundation what might spiritual\
8:33\
cornerstones of our personal and family\
8:35\
lives be they may be the simple plain\
8:40\
and precious principles of gospel living\
8:43\
family prayer scripture study including\
8:47\
the Book of Mormon temple attendance and\
8:50\
gospel learning through come follow me\
8:53\
and\
8:54\
home evening other helpful resources to\
8:57\
strengthen your spiritual foundation may\
8:59\
include the articles of faith the family\
9:01\
Proclamation and the living Christ for\
9:05\
me the principles included in the\
9:06\
questions discussed as part of receiving\
9:08\
a temple recommend serve as a strong\
9:11\
basis for a spiritual foundation\
9:14\
particularly the first four questions I\
9:17\
see them as spiritual cornerstones we of\
9:21\
course are familiar with these questions\
9:23\
as president Nelson read them to us one\
9:26\
by one\
9:27\
in the last General Conference number\
9:31\
one do you have faith in and a testimony\
9:34\
of God the Eternal Father His Son Jesus\
9:37\
Christ and the Holy Ghost number two do\
9:42\
you have a testimony of the atonement of\
9:45\
Jesus Christ and of his role as your\
9:47\
Savior and Redeemer number three do you\
9:51\
have a testimony of the restoration of\
9:54\
the gospel of Jesus Christ and number\
9:57\
four do you sustain the president of the\
10:00\
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day\
10:01\
Saints as the prophet seer and Revelator\
10:03\
and as the only person on the earth\
10:06\
authorized to exercise all priesthood\
10:08\
keys can you see how you might consider\
10:12\
these questions as valuable elements in\
10:15\
your personal foundation to help you\
10:18\
build and reinforce it Paul taught the\
10:21\
Ephesians of a church which was built\
10:23\
upon the foundation of apostles and\
10:25\
prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the\
10:28\
chief Cornerstone in whom all the\
10:31\
building fitly framed together groweth\
10:34\
unto an holy temple in the Lord one of\
10:39\
the greatest joys of my life is becoming\
10:41\
acquainted with and inspired by members\
10:43\
of the church all over the world who are\
10:45\
living exemplars of faith in Jesus\
10:48\
Christ and His gospel they have strong\
10:52\
personal foundations that allow them to\
10:54\
withstand seismic events that with\
10:57\
steady understanding despite their\
11:00\
heartache and pain to display this on a\
11:03\
more personal level I recently spoke at\
11:06\
the funeral\
11:08\
of a beautiful vibrant young wife and\
11:11\
mother also a family friend of ours she\
11:14\
was a scrappy division 1 soccer player\
11:16\
when she met and married her dental\
11:18\
school husband they were blessed with a\
11:22\
beautiful precocious daughter she\
11:25\
valiantly battled with various forms of\
11:27\
cancer for six challenging years despite\
11:30\
the ever-present emotional and physical\
11:33\
distress that she experienced she\
11:35\
trusted in her loving Heavenly Father\
11:37\
and was often quoted widely by her\
11:40\
social media followers for her famous\
11:42\
saying God is in the details\
11:44\
on one of her social media posts she\
11:47\
wrote that someone had asked her how do\
11:50\
you still have faith with all the\
11:52\
heartache that surrounds you\
11:53\
she replied firmly with these words\
11:56\
because faith is what gets me through\
11:59\
these dark times having faith doesn't\
12:01\
mean nothing is nothing bad is going to\
12:03\
happen having faith allows me to believe\
12:06\
that there will be light again and that\
12:10\
light will be even brighter because I\
12:12\
have walked through the dark as much as\
12:16\
much darkness as I have witnessed over\
12:18\
the years I have witnessed far more\
12:20\
light I have seen miracles I felt angels\
12:24\
I have known that my heavenly father was\
12:26\
carrying me none of that would have been\
12:29\
experienced if life were easy the future\
12:33\
of this life may be unknown but my faith\
12:35\
is not if I choose to not have faith\
12:38\
than I choose to only walk in darkness\
12:41\
because without faith darkness is all\
12:44\
that is left her unshakeable testimony\
12:48\
of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ in her\
12:50\
words and in her actions was an\
12:52\
inspiration for others even though her\
12:55\
body was weak she lifted others to be\
12:58\
stronger like this sister I think of\
13:01\
countless other members of the church\
13:03\
warriors like her who walk each day in\
13:06\
faith striving to be true and undaunted\
13:11\
disciples of our Savior Jesus Christ\
13:15\
they learn of Christ they preach of\
13:18\
Christ they strive to emulate him\
13:21\
whether the days of their lives face\
13:25\
steady or unstable ground their\
13:28\
spiritual foundation is strong and\
13:31\
immovable these are the devoted souls\
13:35\
who understand the profound meaning of\
13:38\
the lyrics how firm a foundation you\
13:40\
Saints of the Lord who unto the Savior\
13:43\
for refuge' fled\
13:44\
I'm grateful beyond measure to walk\
13:47\
among those who have prepared a\
13:49\
spiritual foundation worthy of the name\
13:51\
of Saints and who are strong and secure\
13:54\
enough to withstand the many two motes\
13:57\
of life I don't think we can overstate\
14:00\
the importance of such a firm foundation\
14:02\
in our personal lives even at an early\
14:05\
age our primary children are taught as\
14:07\
they sing of this very truth the wise\
14:11\
man built his house upon the rock and\
14:14\
the rains came tumbling down the rains\
14:18\
came down and the floods came up and the\
14:21\
house on the rock Stood Still Scripture\
14:25\
reinforces this foundational doctrine\
14:27\
the Savior taught the people of the\
14:29\
Americas and if you shall always do\
14:32\
these things blessed are ye for a year\
14:34\
built upon my rock but whoso among you\
14:37\
shall do more or less than these are not\
14:39\
built upon my rock but are built upon a\
14:41\
sandy foundation and when the rain\
14:44\
descends and the floods come and the\
14:46\
winds blow and beat upon them they shall\
14:48\
fall it is a sincere hope of church\
14:53\
leaders that the significant renovations\
14:55\
of the Salt Lake Temple will contribute\
14:58\
to the fifth to the fulfillment of\
15:01\
Brigham Young's desire to see the temple\
15:04\
built in a manner that will endure\
15:07\
through the Millennium during these\
15:10\
coming years may we allow these\
15:13\
improvements made to the Salt Lake\
15:14\
Temple to move and inspire us as\
15:18\
individuals and families so that we -\
15:21\
metaphorically will be built in a manner\
15:24\
that will endure the Millennium we will\
15:27\
do so as we fulfill the charge of the\
15:30\
Apostle Paul to lay up in store for\
15:34\
ourselves\
15:35\
a good foundation against the time to\
15:37\
come that we may lay hold on eternal\
15:40\
life it is my ardent prayer that our\
15:44\
spiritual foundation will be sure and\
15:47\
steadfast that our testimony of the\
15:51\
atonement of Jesus Christ and of his\
15:53\
role as our Savior and Redeemer will\
15:56\
become for us our own chief Cornerstone\
15:58\
of whom I testify in his name even Jesus\
16:04\
Christ amen\
16:10\
you\
16:19\
you\
