Now, my dear\
brothers and sisters,\
0:02\
as we commemorate Joseph\
Smith's First Vision\
0:04\
of the Father and\
the Son, we felt\
0:06\
it would be appropriate\
to rejoice together\
0:08\
by participating in\
the Hosanna Shout.\
0:12\
This sacred shout\
was first given\
0:14\
in this dispensation at the\
dedication of the Kirtland\
0:17\
Temple on March 27, 1836.\
0:19\
It is now given at the\
dedication of each temple.\
0:25\
It is a sacred tribute to\
the Father and the Son,\
0:29\
symbolizing the reaction\
of the multitude\
0:32\
when the Savior made His\
triumphal entry into Jerusalem.\
0:35\
It also reaffirms what young\
Joseph experienced that day\
0:40\
in the Sacred Grove--namely,\
that the Father and the Son are\
0:43\
two glorified Beings whom\
we worship and praise.\
0:49\
I will now demonstrate how\
the Hosanna Shout is given.\
0:52\
As I do, I invite our\
colleagues in the media\
0:55\
to treat this very\
sacred observance\
0:58\
with dignity and respect.\
1:01\
Each one participating takes\
a clean white handkerchief,\
1:04\
holding it by one corner,\
and waves it in unison\
1:09\
while saying in unison,\
"Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna\
1:15\
to God and the Lamb,"\
repeated three times, followed\
1:19\
by "Amen, amen, and amen."\
1:26\
If you do not have a\
white handkerchief,\
1:28\
you may simply wave your hand.\
1:31\
Brothers and sisters,\
I now invite you\
1:33\
to stand and participate\
in the Hosanna Shout,\
1:36\
following which the "Hosanna\
Anthem" and "The Spirit of God"\
1:40\
will be sung.\
1:41\
Upon a signal from\
the conductor,\
1:43\
please join in singing\
"The Spirit of God."\
1:49\
"Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna\
to God and the Lamb.\
1:56\
"Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna\
to God and the Lamb.\
2:03\
"Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna\
to God and the Lamb.\
2:11\
"Amen, amen, and amen."\
