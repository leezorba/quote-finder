My beloved brothers and\
sisters, as we welcome you\
0:03\
to this historic April\
2020 general conference\
0:06\
of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints,\
0:10\
for reasons you know,\
I stand before you\
0:14\
in an empty auditorium!\
0:18\
Little did I know,\
when I promised you\
0:21\
at the October 2019\
general conference\
0:24\
that this April\
conference would be\
0:26\
"memorable and\
unforgettable," that speaking\
0:30\
to a visible congregation\
of fewer than 10 people\
0:33\
would make this\
conference so memorable\
0:36\
and unforgettable for me!\
0:41\
Yet the knowledge that\
you are participating\
0:43\
by electronic transmission, and\
the choir's beautiful rendition\
0:48\
of "It Is Well With My Soul,"\
bring great comfort to my soul.\
0:58\
As you know, attendance\
at this general conference\
1:01\
has been strictly limited\
as part of our efforts\
1:04\
to be good global\
citizens and do\
1:08\
all we can to limit\
the spread of COVID-19.\
1:11\
This virus has had a major\
impact throughout the world.\
1:17\
It has also altered our Church\
meetings, missionary service,\
1:22\
and temple work for a while.\
1:26\
Though today's restrictions\
relate to a virulent virus,\
1:30\
life's personal trials stretch\
far beyond this pandemic.\
1:35\
Future trials could\
result from an accident,\
1:39\
a natural disaster, or an\
unexpected personal heartache.\
1:46\
How can we endure such trials?\
1:49\
The Lord has told us\
that "if ye are prepared\
1:52\
ye shall not fear."\
1:56\
Of course, we can\
store our own reserves\
1:59\
of food, water, and savings.\
2:02\
But equally crucial\
is our need to fill\
2:06\
our personal spiritual\
storehouses with faith, truth,\
2:12\
and testimony.\
2:16\
Our ultimate quest in life is\
to prepare to meet our Maker.\
2:21\
We do this by striving\
daily to become more\
2:25\
like our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
2:28\
And we do that as we\
repent daily and receive\
2:32\
His cleansing, healing,\
and strengthening power.\
2:35\
Then we can feel\
enduring peace and joy,\
2:39\
even during turbulent times.\
2:42\
This is exactly why\
the Lord has implored\
2:45\
us to stand in holy\
places and "be not moved."\
2:52\
This year we commemorate\
the 200th anniversary of one\
2:56\
of the most significant events\
in the history of the world:\
2:59\
namely, the appearance\
of God the Father\
3:03\
and His Beloved Son, Jesus\
Christ, to Joseph Smith.\
3:08\
During that singular\
vision, God the Father\
3:12\
pointed to Jesus Christ and\
said, "This is My Beloved Son.\
3:20\
Hear Him!"\
3:24\
That admonition given to\
Joseph is for each of us.\
3:28\
We are to seek, in\
every way we can,\
3:31\
to hear Jesus Christ,\
who speaks to us\
3:36\
through the power and\
ministering of the Holy Ghost.\
3:40\
The purpose of this and\
every general conference\
3:43\
is to help us to hear Him.\
3:46\
We have prayed, and\
invite you to pray,\
3:50\
that the Spirit of the Lord\
will be with us in such rich\
3:53\
abundance that you can hear the\
messages that the Savior has\
3:58\
especially for you--messages\
that will bring peace\
4:03\
to your soul, messages that\
will heal your broken heart,\
4:10\
messages that will\
illuminate your mind,\
4:13\
messages that will help you know\
what to do as you move ahead\
4:20\
through times of\
turmoil and trial.\
4:26\
We pray that this\
conference will\
4:27\
be memorable and\
unforgettable because\
4:30\
of the messages you will hear,\
the unique announcements which\
4:35\
will be made, and the\
experiences in which you\
4:40\
will be invited to participate.\
4:44\
For example, at the conclusion\
of the Sunday morning session,\
4:48\
we will convene a\
worldwide solemn assembly\
4:52\
when I will lead you in\
the sacred Hosanna Shout.\
4:57\
We pray that this will be a\
spiritual highlight for you\
5:01\
as we express in global\
unison our profound gratitude\
5:08\
to God the Father\
and His Beloved Son\
5:11\
by praising Them\
in this unique way.\
5:16\
For this sacred experience we\
use clean, white handkerchiefs.\
5:20\
But if you do not have one,\
you may simply wave your hand.\
5:24\
At the conclusion of\
the Hosanna Shout,\
5:27\
the congregation will\
join with the choir\
5:29\
in singing "The Spirit of God."\
5:34\
My dear brothers and\
sisters, this conference\
5:36\
will be magnificent.\
5:37\
This year will be extraordinary\
as we focus intently\
5:41\
on the Savior and\
His restored gospel.\
5:46\
The most important\
lasting effects\
5:49\
of this historic conference\
will be as our hearts change\
5:53\
and we commence a lifelong\
quest to hear Him.\
6:02\
Welcome to April 2020\
general conference!\
6:05\
I know that God\
our Heavenly Father\
6:07\
and His Son, Jesus\
Christ, are mindful of us.\
6:10\
They will be with us throughout\
the proceedings of these two\
6:13\
glorious days as we seek to draw\
closer to Them and honor Them.\
6:19\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
