Brothers and sisters, I am\
truly grateful to speak to you\
0:04\
on this historic evening\
about the sacred gift\
0:07\
of the priesthood and\
the marvelous power\
0:09\
it has to bless the youth\
in this dispensation.\
0:12\
I pray that despite\
my imperfections,\
0:14\
the Spirit will assist\
me in teaching truth.\
0:17\
The First Presidency and Quorum\
of the Twelve Apostles have\
0:20\
reminded holders of the Aaronic\
Priesthood that "you live\
0:24\
in a day of great opportunities\
and challenges--a day in which\
0:27\
the priesthood\
has been restored.\
0:29\
You have the authority to\
administer the ordinances\
0:32\
of the Aaronic Priesthood.\
0:33\
As you prayerfully and worthily\
exercise that authority,\
0:37\
you will greatly bless the\
lives of those around you."\
0:40\
As the young men\
of the Church, we\
0:42\
are also reminded that we\
are "beloved [sons] of God,\
0:45\
and He has a work\
for [us] to do,"\
0:47\
and we assist in\
His work "to bring\
0:49\
to pass the immortality\
and eternal life of man."\
0:52\
The priesthood is the authority\
to administer the ordinances\
0:55\
and covenants of\
the Savior's gospel\
0:58\
to those who are\
worthy to receive them.\
1:00\
Through these priesthood\
ordinances and sacred covenants\
1:03\
comes the full blessings\
of the Savior's Atonement\
1:06\
that helps us achieve\
our divine destiny.\
1:10\
Joseph Smith was a young man\
who was called of God to restore\
1:13\
the gospel of Jesus Christ,\
and for that purpose\
1:16\
was given the priesthood, which\
he used to bless all mankind.\
1:20\
Doctrine and Covenants 135 cites\
many of the blessings Joseph\
1:25\
has given the youth\
of this dispensation.\
1:27\
We read: "Joseph Smith ... has\
done more, save Jesus only,\
1:32\
for the salvation of\
men in this world,\
1:34\
than any other man that\
ever lived in it. ...\
1:36\
He has brought forth\
the Book of Mormon ... ;\
1:38\
has sent the fulness of\
the everlasting gospel ...\
1:41\
to the four quarters\
of the earth;\
1:43\
has brought forth the\
revelations and commandments\
1:45\
which compose [the]\
Doctrine and Covenants ... ;\
1:47\
gathered many thousands of\
the Latter-day Saints, ...\
1:50\
and left a fame and name\
that cannot be slain."\
1:54\
To effectively serve\
like Joseph did,\
1:56\
we must worthily qualify to use\
the Lord's priesthood power.\
1:59\
While translating the Book\
of Mormon, Joseph and Oliver\
2:02\
Cowdery wanted to be\
baptized, but they\
2:04\
lacked the proper authority.\
2:06\
On May 15, 1829,\
they knelt in prayer\
2:09\
and were visited by John the\
Baptist, who gave them the keys\
2:12\
and authority of the\
Aaronic Priesthood,\
2:14\
saying, "Upon you my fellow\
servants, in the name\
2:18\
of Messiah I confer the\
priesthood of Aaron,\
2:20\
which holds the keys of\
the ministering of angels,\
2:23\
and of the gospel of repentance,\
and of baptism by immersion\
2:27\
for the remission of sins."\
2:30\
We are given the opportunity\
to minister like angels,\
2:33\
to preach the gospel on all\
the continents of the earth,\
2:36\
and to help souls\
come unto Christ.\
2:38\
This service places us in joint\
labor with John the Baptist,\
2:42\
Moroni, Joseph Smith, President\
Nelson, and other diligent\
2:46\
servants of the Lord.\
2:48\
Our service in and\
with His priesthood\
2:51\
brings together those who\
are dedicated to following\
2:53\
and living the Lord's\
teachings with exactness, which\
2:57\
I personally know can\
be difficult as we\
2:59\
face the challenges of youth.\
3:01\
But uniting with these\
fellow servants of the Lord\
3:03\
in accomplishing\
His work will help\
3:05\
to strengthen us against\
the adversary's temptations\
3:08\
and deceptions.\
3:09\
You can become a beacon\
of light to all those\
3:12\
who are unsure of themselves.\
3:14\
The light within you\
will shine so bright\
3:16\
that everyone you interact\
with will be blessed\
3:18\
by just being in your company.\
3:20\
It may be hard at\
times to acknowledge\
3:23\
the presence of our\
spiritual companions,\
3:25\
but I am grateful\
to know that I am\
3:27\
a member of a faithful\
priesthood quorum with whom\
3:29\
I can work to grow\
closer to Christ.\
3:32\
Along with our\
friends and family,\
3:34\
the Holy Ghost is one of\
our most loyal and reliable\
3:37\
companions.\
3:38\
But in order to invite His\
constant companionship,\
3:40\
we must place ourselves\
in situations and places\
3:43\
where He will want\
to be present.\
3:45\
This can begin in\
our own home as we\
3:48\
work to make it a holy\
place by participating\
3:50\
in daily scripture study\
and prayer as a family\
3:53\
and, more importantly, as we\
personally study the scriptures\
3:57\
and pray on our own.\
3:59\
Earlier this year,\
I was provided\
4:01\
with an exciting yet\
humbling opportunity\
4:03\
to help my little sister Oceane\
progress on the covenant path\
4:06\
by accepting the invitation\
to be baptized and fulfill\
4:10\
one of the prescribed\
requirements\
4:12\
to enter the celestial kingdom.\
4:14\
She postponed her\
baptism one month,\
4:16\
until I was ordained a priest,\
to give me the privilege\
4:19\
to perform the ordinance, while\
our other sisters were also\
4:22\
privileged to work under\
priesthood assignment\
4:25\
and stand as witnesses.\
4:27\
As we stood on opposite\
sides of the font\
4:29\
and prepared to enter the\
water, I noticed her excitement,\
4:32\
as it matched mine.\
4:33\
And I felt united with\
her, seeing that she\
4:36\
was making the right decision.\
4:38\
This opportunity to\
exercise the priesthood\
4:41\
required me to be more\
careful and less casual\
4:43\
in my gospel living.\
4:44\
In order to prepare, I went\
to the temple every day\
4:47\
that week, supported by my\
mom, grandma, and sister,\
4:51\
to perform baptisms\
for the dead.\
4:54\
This experience taught me\
a lot about the priesthood\
4:56\
and how I could\
exercise it worthily.\
4:58\
I know that all\
priesthood holders\
5:00\
can feel the same things I felt\
if we follow Nephi's example\
5:03\
to "go and do."\
5:05\
We cannot sit idly and expect\
the Lord to use us in His great\
5:08\
work.\
5:09\
We must not wait for those who\
need our aid to seek us out;\
5:13\
it is our duty as\
priesthood holders\
5:15\
to exemplify and stand\
as witnesses of God.\
5:18\
If we are making\
decisions that inhibit us\
5:20\
from our eternal progression,\
we must change now.\
5:23\
Satan will try his\
hardest to keep us\
5:26\
in a carnal state of\
seeking simple pleasures.\
5:28\
But I know that if\
we put in the effort,\
5:30\
find those who will support\
us, and repent each day,\
5:34\
the resulting blessings\
will be incredible\
5:36\
and our lives will be forever\
changed as we press forward\
5:39\
on the covenant path.\
5:41\
I know that this is the true\
Church of Jesus Christ, who\
5:44\
is our Savior and has delegated\
the keys of the priesthood\
5:47\
to His Apostles, who use\
it to guide us, especially\
5:50\
in these challenging\
days, and to prepare\
5:52\
the world for His return.\
5:54\
I know that Joseph Smith was\
the prophet of the Restoration\
5:57\
and that President Nelson\
is our living prophet today.\
6:00\
I invite all of us\
to study the lives\
6:02\
of these great\
priesthood holders\
6:04\
and seek to improve\
ourselves daily\
6:06\
so we can be ready\
to meet our Maker.\
6:08\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
