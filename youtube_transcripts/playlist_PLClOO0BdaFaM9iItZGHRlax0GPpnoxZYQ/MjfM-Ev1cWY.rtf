The prayer of Elder\
Maynes at the beginning\
0:04\
of this first session of general\
conference is being answered.\
0:09\
Inspiration has come to us\
through wonderful messages\
0:14\
and beautiful music.\
0:16\
The promise of President\
Russell M. Nelson\
0:19\
that this conference\
will be memorable\
0:22\
is already beginning\
to be fulfilled.\
0:26\
President Nelson has\
designated this year\
0:29\
as "a bicentennial\
period commemorating\
0:33\
200 years since God the\
Father and His Beloved Son,\
0:37\
Jesus Christ, appeared to\
Joseph Smith in a vision."\
0:42\
President Nelson invited us to\
make a personal plan to prepare\
0:47\
ourselves for this historic\
conference, which commemoration\
0:52\
he said would be "a hinge point\
in the history of the Church,\
0:57\
and your part is\
vital," he said.\
1:02\
Like me, perhaps you\
heard his message\
1:05\
and asked yourself, "In\
what way is my part vital?"\
1:09\
Perhaps you read and\
prayed about the events\
1:12\
of the Restoration.\
1:13\
Perhaps, more than\
ever before, you\
1:17\
read the accounts\
of those few times\
1:19\
when God the Father\
introduced His Beloved Son.\
1:23\
Perhaps you read\
of the instances\
1:26\
when the Savior spoke to\
the children of our Heavenly\
1:29\
Father.\
1:30\
I know I did all of\
those things, and more.\
1:36\
I found references in my\
reading to the priesthood of God\
1:40\
and the opening\
of dispensations.\
1:43\
I was humbled as I realized\
that my preparation\
1:47\
for this conference was a hinge\
point in my personal history.\
1:54\
I felt changes in my heart.\
1:57\
I felt new gratitude.\
1:59\
I felt, with joy, the\
prospect of being invited\
2:04\
to participate in\
this celebration\
2:07\
of the ongoing Restoration.\
2:12\
I imagine that others\
are feeling, because\
2:14\
of careful preparation, more\
joyful, more optimistic,\
2:19\
and more determined to\
serve in any capacity needed\
2:24\
by the Lord.\
2:26\
The transcendent events we\
honor were the beginning\
2:31\
of the prophesied\
last dispensation,\
2:34\
in which the Lord is preparing\
His Church and His people,\
2:38\
those who bear His\
name, to receive Him.\
2:42\
As part of our preparation\
for His coming,\
2:46\
He will lift each\
of us so we may\
2:49\
rise to spiritual\
challenges and opportunities\
2:54\
unlike any seen in the\
history of this world.\
2:58\
In September 1840, the Prophet\
Joseph Smith and his counselors\
3:04\
in the First Presidency\
declared the following:\
3:10\
"The work of the Lord\
in these last days,\
3:15\
is one of vast magnitude and\
almost beyond the comprehension\
3:21\
of mortals.\
3:22\
Its glories are\
past description,\
3:26\
and its grandeur unsurpassable.\
3:30\
It is the theme which has\
animated the bosom of prophets\
3:34\
and righteous men from\
the creation of the world\
3:38\
down through every succeeding\
generation to the present time;\
3:42\
and it is truly the dispensation\
of the fullness of times,\
3:47\
when all things which\
are in Christ Jesus,\
3:51\
whether in heaven\
or on the earth,\
3:54\
shall be gathered\
together in Him,\
3:56\
and when all things\
shall be restored,\
4:00\
as spoken of by all the holy\
prophets since the world began;\
4:06\
for in it will take place\
the glorious fulfilment\
4:10\
of the promises\
made to the fathers,\
4:12\
while the manifestations of\
the power of the Most High\
4:15\
will be great,\
glorious, and sublime."\
4:21\
THEY WENT ON TO SAY: "We\
feel disposed to go forward\
4:25\
and unite our energies for\
the upbuilding of the Kingdom,\
4:30\
and establishing the Priesthood\
in their fullness and glory.\
4:35\
The work which has to be\
accomplished in the last days\
4:38\
is one of vast\
importance, and will\
4:42\
call into action the energy,\
skill, talent, and ability\
4:47\
of the Saints, so\
that it may roll forth\
4:51\
with that glory and\
majesty described\
4:54\
by the prophet [Daniel];\
and will consequently\
4:57\
require the concentration\
of the Saints,\
5:01\
to accomplish works of such\
magnitude and grandeur."\
5:08\
Many of the specifics\
of what we will do\
5:11\
and when we will do it in\
the unfolding Restoration\
5:14\
are not yet revealed.\
5:16\
Yet the First Presidency\
even in those early days\
5:19\
knew some of the breadth\
and depth of the work\
5:24\
the Lord has set before us.\
5:26\
Here are a few examples of what\
we do know will take place:\
5:31\
Through His Saints,\
the Lord will\
5:34\
offer the gift of His gospel "to\
every nation, kindred, tongue,\
5:40\
and people."\
5:41\
Technology and miracles will\
continue to play a part--as\
5:46\
will individual "fishers of\
men" who minister with power\
5:51\
and increasing faith.\
5:54\
We as a people will\
become more united\
5:58\
amid increasing conflict.\
6:01\
We will be gathered in\
the spiritual strength\
6:04\
of groups and families\
filled with gospel light.\
6:10\
Even an unbelieving\
world will recognize\
6:15\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints\
6:18\
and realize that the\
power of God is upon it.\
6:24\
Faithful and brave disciples\
will fearlessly, humbly,\
6:28\
and openly take upon\
them the name of Christ\
6:34\
in their everyday lives.\
6:38\
How, then, can each of us\
participate in this work\
6:41\
of such magnitude and grandeur?\
6:44\
President Nelson has taught\
how to grow in spiritual power.\
6:49\
When we take repentance as\
a joyful opportunity because\
6:53\
of our growing faith that\
Jesus is the Christ, when\
6:57\
we understand and believe\
that Heavenly Father hears our\
7:01\
every prayer, when we strive to\
obey and live the commandments,\
7:06\
we grow in our power to\
receive continuing revelation.\
7:12\
The Holy Ghost can be\
our constant companion.\
7:17\
A feeling of light\
will stay with us\
7:20\
even as the world around\
us becomes darker.\
7:25\
Joseph Smith is\
an example of how\
7:28\
to grow in such spiritual power.\
7:31\
He showed us that\
the prayer of faith\
7:35\
is the key to\
revelation from God.\
7:39\
He prayed in faith, believing\
that God the Father would\
7:43\
answer his prayer.\
7:44\
He prayed in faith, believing\
that only through Jesus Christ\
7:49\
could he be freed from the\
guilt he felt for his sins.\
7:53\
And he prayed in\
faith, believing\
7:57\
that he needed to find the\
true Church of Jesus Christ\
8:00\
to gain that forgiveness.\
8:03\
Throughout his\
prophetic ministry,\
8:06\
Joseph Smith used\
prayers of faith\
8:09\
to obtain continuous revelation.\
8:13\
As we face today's challenges\
and those yet to come,\
8:18\
we too will need to\
practice the same pattern.\
8:23\
President Brigham\
Young said, "I do not\
8:28\
know any other way for\
the Latter-day Saints\
8:31\
than for every breath\
to be virtually\
8:35\
a prayer for God to guide\
and direct his people."\
8:41\
These words from the\
sacrament prayers\
8:44\
should then describe our daily\
life: "Always remember him."\
8:50\
"Him" refers to Jesus Christ.\
8:53\
The next words, "and\
keep his commandments,"\
8:58\
suggest what it means\
for us to remember Him.\
9:01\
As we remember\
Jesus Christ always,\
9:05\
we might ask in silent prayer,\
"What would He have me do?"\
9:11\
Such prayer, offered in\
faith in Jesus Christ,\
9:16\
ushered in this\
last dispensation.\
9:19\
And it will be at the heart\
of the part each of us\
9:27\
will play in its\
continuing unfolding.\
9:30\
I have found, as you\
have, wonderful examples\
9:35\
of such prayer.\
9:36\
First is Joseph Smith.\
9:38\
He asked in childlike faith\
what the Lord would have him do.\
9:43\
His answer changed the\
history of the world.\
9:49\
To me, an important lesson\
comes from Joseph's response\
9:54\
to Satan's assault as\
Joseph knelt to pray.\
10:00\
I know from experience\
that Satan and his servants\
10:05\
try to make us feel\
that we must not pray.\
10:09\
When Joseph Smith\
exerted all his powers\
10:12\
to call upon God to deliver\
him from the power that\
10:16\
tried to bind him, his prayer\
for relief was answered,\
10:21\
and Heavenly Father and\
Jesus Christ appeared to him.\
10:27\
Satan's attempt to thwart the\
beginning of the Restoration\
10:30\
was so severe because Joseph's\
prayer was so important.\
10:37\
You and I will\
have smaller parts\
10:40\
to play in the\
ongoing Restoration.\
10:43\
Yet the enemy of\
the Restoration will\
10:46\
try to stop us from praying.\
10:49\
The example of Joseph Smith's\
faith and his determination\
10:54\
can strengthen us\
in our resolve.\
10:58\
This is one of many reasons\
why my prayers always\
11:02\
include thanks to Heavenly\
Father for the Prophet Joseph.\
11:08\
Enos in the Book of\
Mormon is another model\
11:10\
for my prayer of faith\
as I try to play my part\
11:14\
in the continuing Restoration.\
11:17\
Whatever your part will\
be, you could take him\
11:20\
as a personal mentor.\
11:22\
Like Joseph, Enos\
prayed in faith.\
11:26\
He described his\
experience this way:\
11:29\
"And my soul hungered; and I\
kneeled down before my Maker,\
11:34\
and I cried unto him in\
mighty prayer and supplication\
11:37\
for mine own soul;\
and all the day long\
11:40\
did I cry unto him; yea,\
and when the night came\
11:43\
I did still raise my voice high\
that it reached the heavens.\
11:48\
"And there came a voice\
unto me, saying: Enos,\
11:51\
thy sins are forgiven thee,\
and thou shalt be blessed.\
11:57\
"And I, Enos, knew\
that God could not lie;\
11:59\
wherefore, my guilt\
was swept away.\
12:03\
"And I said: Lord,\
how is it done?\
12:06\
"And he said unto me:\
Because of thy faith\
12:09\
in Christ, whom thou hast\
never before heard nor seen.\
12:13\
And many years pass away before\
he shall manifest himself\
12:17\
in the flesh; wherefore,\
go to, thy faith hath\
12:23\
made thee whole."\
12:25\
The lesson that has blessed\
me is in these words:\
12:30\
"Because of thy faith\
in Christ, whom thou\
12:33\
hast never before\
heard nor seen."\
12:36\
Joseph had faith in Christ\
to go into the grove\
12:39\
and also to pray for release\
from the powers of Satan.\
12:43\
He had not yet seen\
the Father and the Son,\
12:46\
but he prayed in faith with\
all the energy of his heart.\
12:52\
The experience of\
Enos has taught\
12:54\
me the same precious lesson.\
12:56\
When I pray with faith,\
I have the Savior\
13:00\
as my advocate with the\
Father and I can feel\
13:03\
that my prayer reaches heaven.\
13:06\
Answers come.\
13:08\
Blessings are received.\
13:10\
There is peace and joy\
even in hard times.\
13:16\
I remember when, as\
the newest member\
13:19\
of the Quorum of\
the Twelve Apostles,\
13:21\
I knelt in prayer with\
Elder David B. Haight.\
13:26\
He was about the age I\
am now, with challenges\
13:30\
I now experience myself.\
13:35\
I remember perfectly now\
his voice as he prayed.\
13:41\
I didn't open my eyes to\
look, but it sounded to me\
13:46\
as if he was smiling.\
13:48\
He spoke with Heavenly\
Father with joy in his voice.\
13:55\
I can hear in my mind his\
happiness when he said,\
13:59\
"In the name of Jesus Christ."\
14:02\
It sounded to me as\
if Elder Haight felt\
14:07\
the Savior was affirming\
at that moment the message\
14:10\
he had prayed to the Father.\
14:13\
And I was sure it would\
be received with a smile.\
14:18\
Our ability to make\
our vital contribution\
14:21\
to the wonderful\
continuing Restoration\
14:24\
will increase as we\
grow in our faith\
14:27\
in Jesus Christ as our\
Savior and our Heavenly\
14:31\
Father as our loving Father.\
14:35\
As we pray in faith, we become\
a vital part in the Lord's work\
14:40\
as He prepares the world\
for His Second Coming.\
14:44\
I pray that we all may find\
joy in doing the work He\
14:49\
invites each of us to perform.\
14:52\
I testify that I know\
that Jesus Christ lives.\
14:57\
This is His Church\
and kingdom on earth.\
15:00\
Joseph Smith is the\
prophet of the Restoration.\
15:05\
President Russell M. Nelson\
is the Lord's prophet\
15:08\
on the earth today.\
15:10\
He holds all the keys\
of the priesthood\
15:14\
in The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
15:19\
I so testify with joy\
solemnly and in the name\
15:25\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
