While meeting with the elders\
of the Church on one occasion,\
0:04\
the Prophet Joseph\
Smith declared:\
0:08\
"Take away the Book of Mormon,\
and the revelations, and where\
0:12\
is our religion?\
0:13\
We have none."\
0:17\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
following the First Vision,\
0:20\
the miraculous coming\
forth of the Book of Mormon\
0:24\
is the second\
fundamental milestone\
0:28\
of the unfolding Restoration\
of the gospel of Jesus\
0:31\
Christ in this dispensation.\
0:33\
The Book of Mormon testifies\
of God's love for His children,\
0:38\
of the Lord Jesus Christ's\
selfless and divine atoning\
0:41\
sacrifice, and of His crowning\
ministry among the Nephites\
0:46\
soon after His Resurrection.\
0:48\
It also testifies that the\
remnant of the house of Israel\
0:52\
are to become one through\
His latter-day work\
0:56\
and that they are\
not cast off forever.\
0:59\
As we study the coming forth\
of this holy book of scripture\
1:04\
in these latter days, we come\
to realize that the entire\
1:08\
undertaking was miraculous--from\
the Prophet Joseph receiving\
1:12\
the golden plates from a\
holy angel to its translation\
1:17\
by the "gift and power of\
God," its preservation,\
1:20\
and publication by\
the hand of the Lord.\
1:24\
The coming forth of\
the Book of Mormon\
1:26\
began long before Joseph Smith\
received the golden plates\
1:31\
from the hands of\
the angel Moroni.\
1:34\
Prophets of old prophesied\
about this sacred book's advent\
1:39\
in our day.\
1:40\
Isaiah spoke of a sealed book,\
that when it would appear,\
1:45\
people would be contending\
over God's word.\
1:48\
This circumstance would\
provide the context\
1:51\
wherein God could perform His\
"marvellous work and a wonder,"\
1:55\
causing "the wisdom of\
their wise men [to] perish,\
1:59\
and the understanding of their\
prudent men [to] be hid,"\
2:03\
while the meek would "increase\
their joy in the Lord,\
2:06\
and the poor among\
men shall rejoice\
2:09\
in the Holy One of Israel."\
2:11\
Ezekiel spoke about the\
stick of Judah (the Bible)\
2:16\
and the stick of Ephraim\
(the Book of Mormon)\
2:19\
being brought together as one.\
2:21\
Both Ezekiel (in\
the Old Testament)\
2:24\
and Lehi (in the Book\
of Mormon) indicate\
2:28\
that they shall "grow together"\
to confound false doctrine,\
2:32\
establish peace, and bring us\
to a knowledge of the covenants.\
2:38\
In the evening of\
September 21, 1823,\
2:40\
three and a half years after\
experiencing the First Vision,\
2:48\
Joseph was visited three\
times by the angel Moroni,\
2:52\
the last prophet of the\
Nephites in ancient America,\
2:56\
as a result of his\
sincere prayers.\
3:00\
During their visits that\
lasted through the night,\
3:03\
Moroni told Joseph that God\
had a marvelous work for him\
3:07\
to accomplish--the translation\
and publication to the world\
3:12\
of the inspired words of\
ancient prophets of the American\
3:16\
continent.\
3:17\
The next day, Joseph went to the\
place, not far from his home,\
3:23\
where the plates were buried by\
Moroni at the end of his life,\
3:27\
centuries earlier.\
3:29\
There Joseph saw\
Moroni again, who\
3:33\
instructed him to prepare\
himself to receive\
3:36\
the plates in the future.\
3:39\
Over the next four years, on\
September 22 of each year,\
3:43\
Joseph received additional\
instructions from Moroni\
3:47\
regarding the knowledge about\
how the Lord's kingdom should\
3:51\
be governed in the latter days.\
3:54\
Joseph's preparation\
also included visits\
3:57\
from the angels of God, thus\
unfolding the majesty and glory\
4:02\
of the events that would take\
place in this dispensation.\
4:06\
His marriage to\
Emma Hale in 1827\
4:09\
was part of that preparation.\
4:12\
She played an important\
role in helping the Prophet\
4:16\
throughout his\
life and ministry.\
4:18\
In fact, in September 1827, Emma\
accompanied Joseph to the hill\
4:24\
where the plates were hidden,\
and she waited for him\
4:29\
as the angel Moroni delivered\
the record into Joseph's hands.\
4:33\
Joseph received the\
promise that the plates\
4:37\
would be preserved if he would\
devote all his efforts to keep\
4:42\
them safe until they\
should be returned\
4:45\
into the hands of Moroni.\
4:48\
My dear fellow\
companions in the gospel,\
4:50\
many of today's discoveries\
from ancient times\
4:54\
occur during an archaeological\
excavation or even\
4:58\
by accident during a\
construction project.\
5:02\
Joseph Smith, however,\
was directed to the plates\
5:06\
by an angel.\
5:08\
That outcome by\
itself was a miracle.\
5:11\
The translation process\
of the Book of Mormon\
5:14\
was also a miracle.\
5:16\
This sacred ancient\
record was not\
5:18\
"translated" in the\
traditional way that scholars\
5:22\
would translate ancient texts\
by learning an ancient language.\
5:27\
We ought to look\
at the process more\
5:29\
like a "revelation" with the\
aid of physical instruments\
5:33\
provided by the Lord, as opposed\
to a "translation" by one\
5:38\
with knowledge of languages.\
5:40\
Joseph Smith declared\
that through God's power,\
5:44\
he "translated\
the Book of Mormon\
5:47\
from [hieroglyphs],\
the knowledge of which\
5:50\
was lost to the world, in\
which wonderful event [he]\
5:54\
stood alone, an unlearned youth,\
to combat the worldly wisdom\
5:59\
and multiplied ignorance\
of eighteen centuries,\
6:03\
with a new revelation."\
6:04\
The Lord's help in the\
translation of the plates\
6:10\
is also evident when considering\
the miraculously short time\
6:15\
Joseph Smith took\
to translate it.\
6:18\
Joseph's scribes testified\
of the power of God\
6:22\
that was manifested\
while working\
6:24\
on the translation of\
the Book of Mormon.\
6:27\
Oliver Cowdery once said:\
"These were days never to be\
6:33\
forgotten--to sit under the\
sound of a voice dictated\
6:38\
by the inspiration of heaven,\
awakened the utmost gratitude\
6:42\
of this bosom!\
6:44\
Day after day I\
continued, uninterrupted,\
6:48\
to write from his mouth,\
as he translated ...\
6:51\
'The Book of Mormon.'"\
6:55\
Historical sources reveal\
that from the moment\
6:57\
Joseph Smith obtained\
the plates in 1827,\
7:01\
attempts were made to\
steal them from him.\
7:04\
He noted that "the most\
strenuous exertions were\
7:08\
used to get [the\
plates] from [him]"\
7:10\
and that "every stratagem\
that could be invented\
7:14\
was resorted to\
for that purpose."\
7:17\
Eventually, Joseph\
and Emma were forced\
7:21\
to move from Manchester, New\
York, to Harmony, Pennsylvania,\
7:25\
to find a safe place to proceed\
with the work of translation,\
7:29\
away from mobs and individuals\
who wanted to steal the plates.\
7:34\
As one historian notes, "Thus\
ended the first difficult phase\
7:40\
of Joseph's guardianship\
over the plates.\
7:42\
...\
7:43\
Yet the record was safe, and in\
his struggles to preserve them\
7:47\
Joseph no doubt had learned\
much about the ways of God\
7:52\
and man that would serve him\
well in the time to come."\
7:58\
While translating\
the Book of Mormon,\
8:01\
Joseph learned that\
the Lord would choose\
8:04\
witnesses to see the plates.\
8:06\
This is part of what the\
Lord Himself established\
8:10\
when He said, "In the mouth\
of two or three witnesses\
8:14\
every word may be established."\
8:17\
Oliver Cowdery, David\
Whitmer, and Martin Harris,\
8:21\
who were some of Joseph's\
initial companions\
8:24\
in the establishment\
of God's marvelous\
8:26\
work in this dispensation,\
were the first witnesses\
8:30\
called to bear a special\
testimony of the Book of Mormon\
8:36\
to the world.\
8:39\
They testified\
that an angel, who\
8:45\
came from the\
presence of the Lord,\
8:48\
showed them the ancient\
record and that they\
8:53\
saw the characters\
engraved in the plates.\
8:57\
They also testified that\
they heard the voice of God\
9:00\
from heaven declaring that the\
ancient record was translated\
9:05\
by the gift and power of God.\
9:07\
Then they were\
commanded to testify\
9:11\
of it to the entire world.\
9:13\
The Lord miraculously called\
another eight witnesses\
9:16\
to see the golden\
plates for themselves\
9:19\
and to be special\
witnesses of the truth\
9:23\
and divinity of the Book\
of Mormon to the world.\
9:27\
They testified that they saw and\
carefully examined the plates\
9:36\
and its engraved characters.\
9:38\
Even amid the\
adversities, persecutions,\
9:42\
all kinds of difficulties,\
and even some of them later\
9:47\
faltering in their faith,\
these eleven chosen Book\
9:50\
of Mormon witnesses never\
denied their testimonies\
9:55\
that they had seen the plates.\
9:57\
Joseph Smith was\
not alone anymore\
10:00\
with the knowledge of Moroni's\
visits and the golden plates.\
10:04\
Lucy Mack Smith\
recorded that her son\
10:07\
arrived home overcome with\
joy after the witnesses were\
10:11\
shown the plates.\
10:12\
Joseph explained\
to his parents, "I\
10:16\
feel as if I was relieved of\
a burden which was almost too\
10:20\
heavy for me to bear,\
and it rejoices my soul,\
10:25\
that I am not any longer to be\
entirely alone in the world."\
10:31\
Joseph Smith faced\
much opposition\
10:33\
in printing the Book of\
Mormon as its translation came\
10:37\
to an end.\
10:38\
He was able to convince\
a printer named Egbert B.\
10:43\
Grandin in Palmyra, New\
York, to print it only\
10:47\
after Martin Harris, in an act\
of great faith and sacrifice,\
10:52\
mortgaged his farm as collateral\
for the printing costs.\
10:56\
Due in part to the\
continuing opposition\
10:59\
after the publication\
of the Book of Mormon,\
11:02\
Martin Harris faithfully\
sold 151 acres\
11:06\
of his farm to pay off\
the publication costs.\
11:11\
Through a revelation\
given to Joseph Smith,\
11:15\
the Lord instructed\
Martin Harris\
11:17\
to not covet his property\
and pay the printing\
11:21\
cost for the book that "contains\
the truth and the word of God."\
11:26\
In March 1830 the first 5,000\
copies of the Book of Mormon\
11:31\
were published, and today\
more than 180 million copies\
11:36\
have been printed in\
over a hundred languages.\
11:41\
The historical facts and\
the special witnesses\
11:44\
of the Book of Mormon\
testify that its coming forth\
11:47\
was indeed miraculous.\
11:50\
Nevertheless, the power of this\
book is not based only in its\
11:54\
magnificent history\
but on its powerful,\
11:57\
unparalleled message that\
has changed countless\
12:01\
lives--including mine!\
12:04\
I read the entire Book of\
Mormon for the first time when\
12:08\
I was a young seminary student.\
12:10\
As recommended by my\
teachers, I started\
12:13\
reading it beginning with\
its introduction pages.\
12:17\
The promise contained in\
the first pages of the Book\
12:20\
of Mormon still\
echoes in my mind:\
12:24\
"Ponder in [your] hearts ...\
then ... ask God [in faith] ...\
12:28\
in the name of Christ\
if the book is true.\
12:32\
Those who pursue this course\
... will gain a testimony of its\
12:36\
truth and divinity by the\
power of the Holy Ghost."\
12:42\
With that promise in\
mind, earnestly seeking\
12:44\
to know more about the truth of\
it and in a spirit of prayer,\
12:49\
I studied the Book of\
Mormon, little by little,\
12:52\
as I completed the weekly\
assigned seminary lessons.\
12:56\
I remember like it was yesterday\
that a warm feeling gradually\
13:01\
began swelling in my soul\
and filling my heart,\
13:05\
enlightening my understanding,\
and becoming more and more\
13:09\
delightful as described\
by Alma in his preaching\
13:14\
the word of God to his people.\
13:16\
That feeling eventually\
turned into knowledge\
13:20\
that took root in\
my heart and became\
13:23\
the foundation of my testimony\
of the significant events\
13:27\
and teachings found\
in this sacred book.\
13:30\
Through this and other\
priceless personal experiences,\
13:36\
the Book of Mormon indeed\
became the keystone\
13:39\
that sustains my faith in\
Jesus Christ and my testimony\
13:44\
of the doctrine of His gospel.\
13:46\
It become one of\
the pillars that\
13:48\
testifies to me of Christ's\
divine atoning sacrifice.\
13:54\
It became a shield throughout\
my life against the adversary's\
13:59\
attempts to weaken my faith and\
instill disbelief in my mind\
14:04\
and gives me courage to\
boldly declare my testimony\
14:09\
of the Savior to the world.\
14:12\
My dear friends, my testimony\
of the Book of Mormon\
14:16\
came line upon line as\
a miracle to my heart.\
14:20\
To this day, this\
testimony continues\
14:23\
to grow as I continuously\
search with a sincere heart\
14:28\
to more fully understand\
the word of God\
14:31\
as contained in this\
extraordinary book\
14:35\
of scripture.\
14:37\
To all who hear\
my voice today, I\
14:40\
invite you to be part\
of the marvelous coming\
14:43\
forth of the Book of\
Mormon in your own life.\
14:48\
I promise you that as you\
prayerfully and consistently\
14:53\
study its words, you can\
partake of its promises\
14:57\
and rich blessings in your life.\
15:00\
I reaffirm once more the promise\
that echoes through its pages:\
15:04\
that if you "ask God,\
the Eternal Father,\
15:07\
in the name of Christ, if\
these things are not true;\
15:11\
and if ye shall ask\
with a sincere heart,\
15:15\
with real intent, having faith\
in Christ," He mercifully\
15:20\
"will manifest the\
truth of it unto you,\
15:24\
by the power of the Holy Ghost."\
15:27\
I can assure you\
that He will give you\
15:30\
the answer in a very\
personal way, as He\
15:34\
has done for me and many\
others around the world.\
15:38\
Your experience will be as\
glorious and sacred for you\
15:43\
as Joseph Smith's experiences\
were for him, as well\
15:47\
as for the first\
witnesses and for all\
15:50\
who have sought to receive\
a witness of the integrity\
15:54\
and trustworthiness\
of this sacred book.\
15:58\
I bear my witness that\
the Book of Mormon\
16:01\
is indeed the word of God.\
16:03\
I testify that this\
sacred record "puts forth\
16:07\
the doctrines of the gospel,\
outlines the plan of salvation,\
16:12\
and tells men what they\
must do to gain peace\
16:15\
in this life and eternal\
salvation in the life to come."\
16:20\
I testify that\
the Book of Mormon\
16:23\
is God's instrument to bring\
about the gathering of Israel\
16:27\
in our day and to\
help people to come\
16:30\
to know His Son, Jesus Christ.\
16:34\
I testify that God\
lives and loves us\
16:38\
and His Son, Jesus\
Christ, is the Savior\
16:41\
of the world, the chief\
cornerstone of our religion.\
16:45\
I say these things\
in the sacred name\
16:48\
of our Redeemer, our\
Master, and our Lord,\
16:52\
even Jesus Christ, amen.\
