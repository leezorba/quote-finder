Last October, President\
Russell M. Nelson\
0:04\
invited us to look ahead to\
this April 2020 conference\
0:10\
by each of us in our\
own way looking back\
0:13\
to see the majesty of\
God's hand in restoring\
0:17\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
0:19\
Sister Holland and I took that\
prophetic invitation seriously.\
0:24\
We imagined ourselves\
living in the early 1800s,\
0:29\
looking at the religious\
beliefs of that day.\
0:32\
In that imagined setting,\
we asked ourselves,\
0:37\
"What's missing here?\
0:39\
What do we wish we had?\
0:41\
What do we hope God\
will provide in response\
0:46\
to our spiritual longing?"\
0:49\
Well, for one thing, we realized\
that two centuries ago we\
0:54\
would have dearly hoped for\
the restoration of a truer\
0:57\
concept of God than\
most in that day\
1:01\
had, hidden as He often\
seemed to be behind centuries\
1:06\
of error and misunderstanding.\
1:09\
To borrow a phrase from\
William Ellery Channing,\
1:13\
a prominent religious\
figure of the day,\
1:15\
we would have looked for the\
"parental character of God,"\
1:20\
which Channing considered\
"the first great doctrine\
1:24\
of Christianity."\
1:25\
Such a doctrine would\
have recognized Deity\
1:29\
as a caring Father in Heaven\
rather than a harsh judge\
1:35\
dispensing stern justice or\
as an absentee landlord who\
1:40\
had once been engaged\
in earthly matters\
1:43\
but was now preoccupied\
somewhere else in the universe.\
1:48\
Yes, our hopes in\
1820 would have\
1:51\
been to find God\
speaking and guiding\
1:55\
as openly in the present as He\
did in the past, a true Father\
2:00\
in the most loving\
sense of that word.\
2:04\
He certainly would not have been\
a cold, arbitrary autocrat who\
2:09\
predestined a select\
few for salvation\
2:13\
and then consigned the rest of\
the human family to damnation.\
2:17\
No, He would be one whose every\
action, by divine declaration,\
2:24\
would be "for the\
benefit of the world;\
2:27\
for he loveth the world"\
and every inhabitant in it.\
2:32\
That love would be\
His ultimate reason\
2:36\
for sending Jesus Christ,\
His Only Begotten Son,\
2:40\
to the earth.\
2:43\
Speaking of Jesus, had we\
lived in those first years\
2:48\
of the 19th century,\
we would have\
2:51\
realized with great\
alarm that doubts\
2:54\
about the reality\
of the Savior's life\
2:57\
and Resurrection were beginning\
to take significant hold\
3:02\
within Christendom.\
3:03\
Therefore, we would\
have hoped for evidence\
3:07\
to come to the whole\
world that would confirm\
3:11\
the biblical witness that Jesus\
is the Christ, the literal Son\
3:17\
of God, Alpha and Omega, and\
the only Savior this world will\
3:22\
ever know.\
3:23\
It would have been among\
our dearest hopes that other\
3:27\
scriptural evidence be brought\
forward--something that could\
3:31\
constitute another\
testament of Jesus Christ,\
3:34\
enlarging and enhancing our\
knowledge of His miraculous\
3:39\
birth, wondrous ministry,\
atoning sacrifice,\
3:44\
and His glorious Resurrection.\
3:47\
Truly such a document would\
be "righteousness [sent]\
3:52\
down out of heaven; and truth\
[sent] forth out of the earth."\
3:59\
Observing the Christian\
world in that day,\
4:01\
we would have hoped to\
find someone authorized\
4:06\
by God with true\
priesthood authority who\
4:10\
could baptize us, bestow\
the gift of the Holy Ghost,\
4:14\
and administer all\
gospel ordinances\
4:17\
necessary for salvation.\
4:20\
In 1820, we would have\
hoped to see fulfilled\
4:25\
the eloquent promises\
of Isaiah, Micah,\
4:29\
and other ancient\
prophets regarding\
4:31\
the return of the majestic\
house of the Lord.\
4:35\
We would have thrilled to\
see the glory of holy temples\
4:40\
established again, with\
the Spirit, the ordinances,\
4:45\
the power, and the authority\
to teach eternal truths,\
4:50\
heal personal wounds, and bind\
families together forever.\
4:57\
I would have looked\
anywhere and everywhere\
5:01\
to find someone\
authorized to say\
5:05\
to me and to my beloved Patricia\
that our marriage in such\
5:11\
a setting was sealed for\
time and all eternity,\
5:16\
never to hear or have imposed\
on us the haunting curse\
5:23\
"until death do you part."\
5:26\
I know that "in [our] Father's\
house are many mansions,"\
5:31\
but, speaking\
personally, if I were\
5:35\
to be so fortunate as\
to inherit one of them,\
5:38\
it could be no more to me\
than a decaying shack if Pat\
5:45\
and our children were not with\
me to share that inheritance.\
5:51\
And for our ancestors, some of\
whom lived and died anciently\
5:56\
without even hearing the\
name of Jesus Christ,\
6:00\
we would have hoped for\
that most just and merciful\
6:05\
of biblical concepts, that it\
would be restored--the practice\
6:10\
of the living offering up\
saving ordinances on behalf\
6:14\
of their kindred dead.\
6:16\
No practice I can\
imagine would demonstrate\
6:20\
with more splendor a loving\
God's concern for every one\
6:25\
of His earthly children\
no matter where they lived\
6:30\
nor where they died.\
6:34\
Well, our 1820 list\
of hopes could go on,\
6:39\
but perhaps the most important\
message of the Restoration\
6:44\
is that such hopes would\
not have been in vain.\
6:50\
Beginning in the Sacred Grove\
and continuing to this day,\
6:55\
these desires began to\
be clothed in reality\
7:00\
and became, as the\
Apostle Paul and others\
7:04\
taught, true anchors to the\
soul, sure and steadfast.\
7:10\
What was once only hoped\
for has now become history.\
7:18\
Thus, our look back at 200 years\
of God's goodness to the world.\
7:25\
But what of our look ahead?\
7:28\
We still have hopes that\
have not yet been fulfilled.\
7:33\
Even as we speak, we are\
waging an "all hands on deck"\
7:38\
war with COVID-19,\
a solemn reminder\
7:43\
that a virus 1,000 times\
smaller than a grain of sand\
7:47\
can bring entire populations\
and global economies\
7:52\
to their knees.\
7:54\
We pray for those\
who have lost loved\
7:58\
ones in this modern\
plague, as well as\
8:01\
for those who are currently\
infected or at risk.\
8:04\
We certainly pray for\
those who are giving\
8:06\
such magnificent health care.\
8:09\
When we have conquered this--and\
we will--may we be equally\
8:15\
committed to freeing the\
world from the virus of hunger\
8:19\
and freeing neighborhoods\
and nations from the virus\
8:24\
of poverty.\
8:26\
May we hope for schools where\
students are taught--not\
8:31\
terrified they will be shot--and\
for the gift of personal\
8:36\
dignity for every child of God,\
unmarred by any form of racial,\
8:44\
ethnic, or religious prejudice.\
8:48\
Undergirding all of this\
is our relentless hope\
8:54\
for greater devotion to the two\
greatest of all commandments:\
8:59\
to love God by\
keeping His counsel\
9:04\
and to love our\
neighbors by showing\
9:07\
kindness and compassion,\
patience and forgiveness.\
9:13\
These two divine directives are\
still--and forever will be--the\
9:20\
only real hope we have for\
giving our children a better\
9:27\
world than the\
one they now know.\
9:32\
In addition to these\
global desires,\
9:34\
many in this audience today\
have deeply personal hopes:\
9:40\
hope for a marriage to\
improve, or sometimes\
9:45\
just hope for a marriage;\
hope for an addiction\
9:50\
to be conquered; hope for a\
wayward child to come back;\
9:56\
hope for physical and emotional\
pain of a hundred kinds\
10:03\
to cease.\
10:05\
Because the\
Restoration reaffirmed\
10:08\
the foundational truth that\
God does work in this world,\
10:14\
we can hope, we\
should hope, even when\
10:18\
facing the most\
insurmountable odds.\
10:22\
That's what the scripture meant\
when Abraham was able to hope\
10:29\
against hope--that is, he\
was able to believe in spite\
10:35\
of every reason not to\
believe--that he and Sarah\
10:41\
could conceive a child when\
that seemed utterly impossible.\
10:48\
So I ask: "If so many\
of our 1820 hopes\
10:56\
could begin to be fulfilled\
with a divine flash of light\
11:03\
to a mere boy kneeling in a\
patch of trees in Upstate New\
11:08\
York, why should we not\
hope that righteous desires\
11:15\
and Christlike yearnings\
can still be marvelously,\
11:20\
miraculously answered\
by the God of all hope?"\
11:25\
We all need to believe that\
what we desire in righteousness\
11:31\
can someday, someway,\
somehow yet be ours.\
11:40\
Brothers and\
sisters, we know what\
11:42\
some of the religious\
deficiencies\
11:44\
in the early 19th century were.\
11:47\
Furthermore, we know\
something of today's\
11:51\
religious shortcomings\
that still leave the hunger\
11:55\
and hope of some unfulfilled.\
11:58\
We know a variety of\
those dissatisfactions\
12:01\
are leading some away from\
traditional ecclesiastical\
12:06\
institutions.\
12:07\
We also know, as one\
frustrated writer wrote,\
12:12\
that "many religious leaders\
[of the day] seem clueless"\
12:16\
in addressing this\
kind of decline,\
12:19\
offering in response "a thin\
gruel of therapeutic deism,\
12:24\
cheap symbolic activism,\
carefully couched heresy,\
12:30\
[or sometimes just] uninspiring\
nonsense"--and all at a time\
12:39\
when the world\
needs so much more,\
12:41\
when the rising generation\
deserves so much more,\
12:46\
and when in Jesus's day\
He offered so much more.\
12:53\
As disciples of Christ\
we can in our day\
12:58\
rise above those ancient\
Israelites who moaned,\
13:02\
"Our bones are dried,\
and our hope is lost."\
13:07\
Indeed, if we\
finally lose hope, we\
13:13\
lose our last\
sustaining possession.\
13:17\
It was over the\
very gate of hell\
13:20\
that Dante wrote a\
warning to all those\
13:25\
traveling through\
his Divina Commedia:\
13:28\
"Abandon all hope," he\
said, "ye who enter here."\
13:34\
Truly when hope is\
gone, what we have left\
13:40\
is the flame of the inferno\
raging on every side.\
13:48\
So, when our backs\
are to the wall\
13:52\
and, as the hymn says,\
"other helpers fail\
13:56\
and comforts flee," among our\
most indispensable virtues\
14:02\
will be this\
precious gift of hope\
14:07\
linked inextricably to our\
faith in God and our charity\
14:14\
to others.\
14:16\
In this bicentennial year when\
we look back to see all we have\
14:22\
been given and rejoice in the\
realization of so many hopes\
14:29\
fulfilled, I echo the sentiment\
of a beautiful young returned\
14:36\
sister missionary who said to\
us in Johannesburg just a few\
14:41\
months ago, "[We] did not come\
this far to only come this\
14:47\
far."\
14:49\
Paraphrasing one of the most\
inspiring valedictories ever\
14:54\
recorded in scripture, I\
say with the prophet Nephi\
14:59\
and that young sister:\
15:02\
"My beloved brethren [and\
sisters], after ye have\
15:07\
[received these first\
fruits of the Restoration],\
15:11\
I would ask if all is done?\
15:14\
Behold, I say unto you, Nay; ...\
15:18\
"...\
15:18\
[You] must press forward with\
a steadfastness in Christ,\
15:24\
having a perfect brightness\
of hope, and a love of God\
15:32\
and of all men.\
15:34\
...\
15:35\
If [you] shallshall[,]\
... saith the Father:\
15:37\
[You] shall have eternal life."\
15:42\
I give thanks, my\
brothers and sisters,\
15:45\
for all we've been given\
in this last and greatest\
15:51\
of all dispensations,\
the dispensation\
15:54\
of the restored gospel\
of Jesus Christ.\
15:59\
The gifts and the blessings\
that flow from that gospel mean\
16:05\
everything to\
me--everything--and\
16:08\
so in an effort to thank my\
Father in Heaven for them,\
16:15\
I have "promises to keep, /\
And miles to go before I sleep,\
16:21\
/ And miles to go\
before I sleep."\
16:25\
May we press forward\
with love in our hearts,\
16:31\
walking in the\
"brightness of hope"\
16:34\
that lights the path\
of holy anticipation\
16:38\
that we've been on\
now for 200 years.\
16:42\
I testify that the\
future is going\
16:46\
to be as miracle-filled\
and bountifully blessed\
16:50\
as the past has been.\
16:52\
We have every reason to hope\
for blessings even greater\
16:59\
than those we've\
already received,\
17:01\
because this is the\
work of Almighty God;\
17:06\
this is the Church of\
continuing revelation;\
17:11\
this is the gospel of\
Christ's unlimited grace\
17:17\
and benevolence.\
17:19\
I bear witness to\
all of these truths\
17:23\
and so much more, in the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
