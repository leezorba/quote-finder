0:07\
adjustments to help me my doctor\
0:10\
prescribed a nutrition and exercise plan\
0:12\
which have I chose to follow would\
0:15\

0:18\
we each underwent a spiritual\
0:20\
examination what would we learn about\
0:22\
ourselves what adjustments would our\
0:25\
spiritual physician prescribed for us to\
0:28\
become who we need to be it is essential\
0:31\
that we know what to do and do what we\
0:34\

0:39\
up our wounds takes upon himself our\
0:42\
infirmities and heals our broken hearts\
0:44\
through His grace our weakness can\
0:47\
become strong he invites us to follow\
0:50\
him by learning of him listening to his\
0:53\
words and walking in the meekness of his\
0:55\
spirit he has promised to help us in\
0:58\
this lifelong process of conversion\
0:59\
which transforms us and brings\
1:02\
everlasting joy the Savior has given us\
1:06\
the Book of Mormon as a powerful tool to\
1:08\
aid in conversion the Book of Mormon\
1:11\
provides spiritual nutrition prescribes\
1:13\
a plan of action and connects us with\
1:16\
the holy spirit written for us it\
1:19\
contains the word of God and plainness\
1:21\
and tells us of our identity purpose and\
1:24\
destiny with the Bible the book of\
1:27\
Mormon testifies of Jesus Christ and\
1:29\
teaches how we can know truth and become\
1:33\
like him brother Saul polo was 58 years\
1:37\
old when he was introduced to the\
1:38\
restored gospel of Jesus Christ when I\
1:41\
met him he had been serving as a branch\
1:43\
president for several years but I\
1:46\
learned that he had never read the book\
1:47\
of Mormon because it was not yet\
1:49\
available in his native Burmese when I\
1:52\
asked him how he knew that the book was\
1:54\
true without having read it he replied\
1:57\
that he had studied the Book of Mormon\
1:59\
stories picture book every day by\
2:02\
looking at the illustrations using a\
2:05\
dictionary to translate the English\
2:06\
words and taking careful notes of what\
2:09\
he learned he explained every time I\
2:13\
studied\
2:13\
I would pray about what I learned and I\
2:16\
would feel peace and joy my mind would\
2:18\
be clear and my heart would be soft I\
2:21\
felt the Holy Ghost testifying to me\
2:23\
that it was true I know that the Book of\
2:26\
Mormon is the word of God like brother\
2:30\
Saul polo\
2:30\
each of us can study the Book of Mormon\
2:32\
according to our circumstances as we\
2:35\
desire to believe and ponder its\
2:37\
teachings in our hearts we can ask God\
2:39\
in faith if the teachings are true if we\
2:42\
are sincere in our desire to know and\
2:44\
have real intent to act he will answer\
2:47\
us in our hearts through the Holy Ghost\
2:49\
it is by the power of the Holy Ghost\
2:52\
that we will know the truth of all\
2:53\
things when we obtain a divine witness\
2:57\
of the Book of Mormon we will also know\
2:59\
by the same power that Jesus Christ is\
3:01\
the savior of the world that Joseph\
3:04\
Smith is his prophet and that the Church\
3:06\
of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints is\
3:08\
his restored church as a young man\
3:12\
beginning my missionary service I\
3:14\
boarded an airplane headed to Australia\
3:16\
feeling very alone anxious and\
3:19\
inadequate but having committed to serve\
3:21\
I desperately needed reassurance that\
3:24\
what I believed in was true I prayed and\
3:28\
read my scriptures earnestly but as the\
3:30\
flight progressed my self-doubt\
3:33\
intensified and my physical condition\
3:35\
deteriorated after I've been struggling\
3:38\
for several hours a flight attendant\
3:41\
walked down the aisle and stopped next\
3:42\
to my seat he took the Book of Mormon I\
3:45\
was reading from my hands he looked at\
3:48\
the cover and said that's a great book\
3:50\
then handed the book back to me and kept\
3:53\
walking I never saw him again\
3:56\
while his words echoed in my ears I\
3:59\
distinctly heard and felt in my heart I\
4:02\
am here and I know where you are just do\
4:06\
your best\
4:07\
for I will take care of the rest on that\
4:10\
airplane above the Pacific Ocean I\
4:13\
received a personal witness through my\
4:16\
study of the Book of Mormon and the\
4:17\
promptings of the Holy Spirit that my\
4:20\
Savior knew who I was and that the\
4:22\
gospel was true elder David a Bednarz\
4:25\
taught quote\
4:27\
knowing that the gospel is true is the\
4:29\
essence of a testimony consistently\
4:32\
being true to the gospel as he and as\
4:35\
the essence of conversion close quote\
4:38\
conversion requires us to be doers of\
4:40\
the word and not hearers only the Lord's\
4:43\
action plan for us the doctrine of\
4:45\
Christ is taught most clearly in the\
4:48\
Book of Mormon it includes first\
4:51\
exercising faith in Jesus Christ by\
4:53\
trusting him keeping his Commandments\
4:55\
and knowing that he will help us\
4:57\
second repenting daily of our\
5:00\
shortcomings and experiencing joy and\
5:02\
peace when he forgives us repentance\
5:05\
requires us to forgive others and helps\
5:07\
us to move forward the Savior has\
5:09\
promised to forgive us as often as we\
5:12\
repent third making and keeping\
5:15\
covenants with God through ordinances\
5:17\
such as baptism this will keep us on the\
5:20\
Covenant path that leads to him fourth\
5:23\
receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost\
5:26\
this gift allows us the constant\
5:28\
companionship of one who sanctifies\
5:30\
comforts and guides us and fifth\
5:33\
enduring to the end by pressing forward\
5:36\
steadfastly while feasting daily upon\
5:39\
the word of Christ by feasting from the\
5:41\
Book of Mormon and holding fast to its\
5:44\
teachings we can overcome temptations\
5:46\
and receive guidance and protection\
5:48\
throughout our lives by consistently\
5:52\
applying the doctrine of Christ in our\
5:53\
lives we will overcome inertia that\
5:56\
impedes change and fear the Foyle's\
5:59\
action we will receive personal\
6:01\
revelation for the Holy Ghost will show\
6:04\
unto you all things what ye should do\
6:05\
and the words of Christ will tell you\
6:08\
all things what you should do for twenty\
6:12\
years for the wanjin tone struggled with\
6:14\
alcohol cigarettes and compulsive\
6:16\
gambling when introduced to Jesus Christ\
6:19\
in his restored gospel brother Wong\
6:22\
desired to change for the sake of his\
6:23\
young family his greatest challenge was\
6:26\
smoking a heavy chain smoker he had\
6:29\
tried to quit many times and\
6:30\
successfully one day these words from\
6:33\
the Book of Mormon lodged in his mind\
6:35\
with a sincere heart with real intent\
6:40\
previous attempts had failed he felt\
6:43\
perhaps he could change with help from\
6:44\
Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ the\
6:47\
full-time missionaries United their\
6:49\
faith with his and provided an action\
6:51\
plan of practical interventions along\
6:53\
with heavy doses of prayer and studying\
6:55\
the Word of God with sincerity and real\
6:58\
intent brother Huang acted with faithful\
7:01\
determination and found that as he\
7:03\
focused more on the new habits he wished\
7:05\
to develop such as studying the Book of\
7:07\
Mormon he focused less on the habits he\
7:10\
wanted to lose recalling his experience\
7:13\
from 15 years ago he remarked I don't\
7:16\
remember one exactly I quit smoking but\
7:18\
that I tried hard every day to do the\
7:20\
things I knew I needed to do to invite\
7:23\
the Spirit of the Lord into my life and\
7:25\
kept doing them I was no longer\
7:27\
attracted to cigarettes and have not\
7:30\
been since through applying the\
7:32\
teachings of the Book of Mormon but the\
7:34\
Huang's life has been transformed and he\
7:37\
has become a better husband and father\
7:40\
president Russell M Nelson has promised\
7:42\

7:45\
of Mormon every day you will make better\
7:48\
decisions every day I promise that as\
7:51\

7:55\
answers to your own questions and\
7:57\
direction for your own life I promise\
8:00\

gripping plague of pornography and other\
8:09\
mind-numbing addictions close quote dear\
8:12\

words we will obtain a witness of his\
8:22\
truthfulness as we consistently live\
8:25\
according to its teachings we will have\
8:27\
no more desire to do evil our heart\
8:30\
