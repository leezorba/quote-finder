Recently a billboard in Salt\
Lake City caught my eye.\
0:04\
It advertised a furniture\
and interior design company.\
0:08\
It stated simply,\
"Serving the Finest Homes\
0:11\
in Salt Lake City."\
0:13\
The message was catchy--what\
is a "finest home"?\
0:17\
I found myself thinking about\
that question, especially\
0:20\
with regard to the\
children my wife, Kathy,\
0:22\
and I raised and the children\
they are raising today.\
0:26\
Like parents everywhere,\
we worried about\
0:29\
and prayed over our family.\
0:30\
We still do.\
0:32\
We earnestly want the\
very best for them.\
0:35\
How can they and their children\
live in the finest homes?\
0:40\
I have reflected on the\
homes of Church members Kathy\
0:43\
and I have been\
privileged to visit.\
0:44\
We have been invited into\
homes in Korea and Kenya,\
0:48\
in the Philippines and\
Peru, in Laos and Latvia.\
0:52\
Let me share four\
observations about fine homes.\
0:57\
First, from the\
Lord's perspective,\
0:59\
establishing the\
finest homes has\
1:02\
everything to do with\
the personal qualities\
1:04\
of the people who live there.\
1:06\
These homes aren't made fine\
in any important or lasting way\
1:11\
by their furniture or by the\
net worth or social status\
1:14\
of the people who own them.\
1:16\
The finest characteristic\
of any home\
1:19\
is the image of Christ reflected\
in the homes' residents.\
1:24\
What matters is\
the interior design\
1:27\
of the souls of the inhabitants,\
not the structure itself.\
1:31\
The attributes of\
Christ are acquired\
1:34\
in the "process of time"\
by intentional progress\
1:38\
along the covenant path.\
1:40\
Christlike attributes adorn\
the lives of those who\
1:43\
strive to live with goodness.\
1:45\
They fill homes\
with gospel light,\
1:48\
whether the floor\
is mud or marble.\
1:52\
Even if you are the only\
one in your household\
1:56\
who follows the injunction\
to "seek after these things,"\
2:00\
you can contribute to\
the spiritual furnishings\
2:03\
of your family's home.\
2:05\
We follow the Lord's counsel to\
"organize [ourselves]; prepare\
2:09\
every needful thing;\
and establish a house"\
2:12\
by organizing, preparing,\
and establishing\
2:14\
our spiritual lives,\
not our real estate.\
2:18\
As we patiently pursue the\
Savior's covenant path,\
2:22\
our home becomes "a house of\
glory, a house of order, [and]\
2:27\
a house of God."\
2:30\
Second, residents\
in the finest homes\
2:32\
make time to study the\
scriptures and the words\
2:35\
of living prophets every day.\
2:37\
President Russell M.\
Nelson has invited\
2:40\
us to "transform" and "remodel"\
our homes through gospel study.\
2:45\
His invitation recognizes\
that fine homes house\
2:50\
the tender, vital work\
of personal growth\
2:53\
and remodeling our weaknesses.\
2:56\
Daily repentance is\
a transformative tool\
2:59\
that enables us to grow a little\
kinder, more loving, and more\
3:03\
understanding.\
3:05\
Studying the\
scriptures brings us\
3:07\
closer to the Savior, whose\
generous love and grace\
3:12\
assist us with our growth.\
3:15\
The Bible, Book of Mormon,\
and Pearl of Great Price\
3:18\
tell the stories of families,\
so it's not surprising\
3:21\
that those divine volumes\
are incomparable handbooks\
3:25\
for constructing\
the finest homes.\
3:27\
They chronicle the\
worries of parents,\
3:30\
the perils of temptation,\
the triumph of righteousness,\
3:34\
the trials of famine\
and abundance,\
3:37\
and the horrors of war\
and rewards of peace.\
3:40\
Again and again the\
scriptures show us\
3:43\
how families succeed\
through righteous living\
3:46\
and how they fail by\
pursuing other paths.\
3:52\
Third, fine homes follow the\
blueprint created by the Lord\
3:57\
for His finest home, the temple.\
3:59\
Building a temple begins with\
basic steps--clearing brush\
4:04\
and leveling land.\
4:05\
Those initial efforts\
to ready the ground\
4:08\
might be compared to keeping\
the basic commandments.\
4:11\
The commandments\
are the foundation\
4:14\
on which discipleship is\
built. Steady discipleship\
4:18\
leads us to become firm,\
steadfast, and immovable,\
4:22\
like the steel\
framework for a temple.\
4:25\
This steady framework allows\
the Lord to send His Spirit\
4:29\
to change our hearts.\
4:31\
Experiencing a mighty\
change of heart\
4:33\
is like adding\
beautiful features\
4:35\
to the interior of a temple.\
4:37\
As we continue in faith, the\
Lord gradually changes us.\
4:41\
We receive His image\
in our countenance\
4:44\
and begin to reflect the love\
and beauty of His character.\
4:47\
As we become more like Him, we\
will feel at home in His house,\
4:53\
and He will feel\
at home in ours.\
4:56\
We can maintain our home's\
close connection to His home\
4:59\
by qualifying for and using a\
temple recommend as frequently\
5:04\
as circumstances allow.\
5:06\
As we do so, the holiness of the\
Lord's house rests in our house\
5:10\
as well.\
5:11\
The magnificent Salt Lake\
Temple stands nearby.\
5:15\
Built by pioneers with\
rudimentary tools,\
5:19\
local materials, and\
endless hard work,\
5:22\
the temple was constructed\
from 1853 to 1893.\
5:25\
The best the early\
Church members\
5:28\
had to offer in engineering,\
architecture, and interior\
5:31\
design created a masterpiece\
that is recognized by millions.\
5:36\
Nearly 130 years have passed\
since the temple was dedicated.\
5:40\
As Elder Gary E.\
Stevenson noted yesterday,\
5:44\
the engineering principles\
used to design the temple\
5:47\
have been replaced by\
newer, safer standards.\
5:50\
Failure to enhance the\
temple's engineering\
5:53\
and repair structural weaknesses\
would betray the confidence\
5:57\
of the pioneers, who did\
all they could and then left\
6:00\
the temple's care to\
succeeding generations.\
6:03\
The Church has commenced a\
four-year restoration project\
6:06\
to improve the\
temple's structural\
6:08\
and seismic strength.\
6:10\
The foundations, floors,\
and walls will be fortified.\
6:13\
The best engineering\
knowledge available today\
6:16\
will bring the temple\
up to modern standards.\
6:19\
We will not be able to see\
the structural changes,\
6:22\
but their effects will\
be real and important.\
6:26\
In all of this\
work, the temple's\
6:27\
beautiful interior design\
features will be preserved.\
6:32\
We should follow the example\
being given to us by the Salt\
6:35\
Lake Temple renovation\
and take time\
6:37\
to evaluate our own\
spiritual seismic engineering\
6:41\
to make sure it is up to date.\
6:43\
Periodic\
self-assessment, coupled\
6:46\
with asking the Lord,\
"What lack I yet?"\
6:49\
can help each of us\
contribute to the building\
6:51\
of a finest home.\
6:54\
Fourth, the finest homes\
are refuges from the storms\
6:57\
of life.\
6:58\
The Lord has promised\
that those who\
7:00\
keep the commandments of\
God "prosper in the land."\
7:03\
God's prosperity is the\
power to press forward\
7:06\
despite the problems of life.\
7:09\
In 2002 I learned an important\
lesson about problems.\
7:13\
While in Asuncion, Paraguay,\
I met with the city's stake\
7:16\
presidents.\
7:17\
At that time, Paraguay faced\
a terrible financial crisis,\
7:21\
and many Church\
members were suffering\
7:23\
and unable to make ends meet.\
7:25\
I had not been to South\
America since my mission\
7:28\
and had never been to Paraguay.\
7:29\
I had only been\
serving in that Area\
7:31\
Presidency for a few weeks.\
7:33\
Apprehensive about my inability\
to give guidance to those stake\
7:37\
presidents, I asked\
them to tell me only\
7:40\
what was going well\
in their stakes.\
7:42\
The first stake\
president told me\
7:44\
about things that\
were going well.\
7:45\
The next mentioned things\
that were going well\
7:48\
and a few problems.\
7:49\
By the time we got to\
the last stake president,\
7:52\
he mentioned only a series\
of vexing challenges.\
7:55\
As the stake presidents\
explained the magnitude\
7:58\
of the situation, I grew\
increasingly concerned, nearly\
8:01\
desperate, about what to say.\
8:04\
Just as the last stake president\
was finishing his comments,\
8:07\
a thought came into my mind:\
8:10\
"Elder Clayton, ask\
them this question:\
8:16\
'Presidents, of the members\
in your stakes who pay a full\
8:18\
tithing, pay a\
generous fast offering,\
8:21\
magnify their callings\
in the Church,\
8:23\
actually visit their families\
as home teachers or visiting\
8:26\
teachers every month,\
hold family home evening,\
8:29\
study the scriptures, and\
hold family prayer each day,\
8:32\
how many have problems they\
cannot address on their own\
8:36\
without the Church having\
to step in and solve\
8:38\
their problems for them?'"\
8:40\
Responsive to the\
impression I had received,\
8:42\
I asked the stake\
presidents that question.\
8:45\
They looked at me\
in surprised silence\
8:47\
and then said, "Pues, ninguno,"\
meaning, "Well, no one."\
8:52\
They then told me that\
none of the members who\
8:54\
did all of those\
things had problems\
8:56\
they were incapable of\
resolving on their own.\
8:59\
Why?\
9:00\
Because they lived\
in the finest homes.\
9:03\
Their faithful living provided\
them the strength, vision,\
9:07\
and heavenly help they needed\
in the economic turmoil that\
9:11\
surrounded them.\
9:13\
This doesn't mean the righteous\
won't become ill, suffer\
9:16\
accidents, face\
business reversals,\
9:18\
or confront many other\
difficulties in life.\
9:20\
Mortality always\
brings challenges,\
9:23\
but time after time I\
have seen that those\
9:26\
who strive to obey\
the commandments\
9:28\
are blessed to find their way\
forward with peace and hope.\
9:33\
Those blessings are\
available to everyone.\
9:37\
David declared, "Except\
the Lord build the house,\
9:40\
they labour in vain\
that build it."\
9:43\
Wherever you live, whatever\
your house looks like,\
9:46\
and whatever the\
composition of your family,\
9:49\
you can help build the\
finest home for your family.\
9:53\
The restored gospel\
of Jesus Christ\
9:56\
provides the plans\
for that home.\
9:58\
The Savior is the perfect\
engineer, builder,\
10:02\
and interior designer.\
10:03\
His project is the perfection\
and eternal joy of our souls.\
10:09\
With His loving help, your soul\
can be all He wants it to be\
10:14\
and you can be the finest\
version of yourself,\
10:17\
prepared to establish and\
live in a finest home.\
10:21\
I gratefully testify that the\
God and Father of us all lives.\
10:26\
His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ,\
is the Savior and Redeemer\
10:31\
of all mankind.\
10:32\
They love us perfectly.\
10:35\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints\
10:38\
is the Lord's kingdom on earth.\
10:41\
Living prophets and\
apostles guide it today.\
10:45\
The Book of Mormon is true.\
10:49\
The restored gospel\
of Jesus Christ\
10:51\
is the perfect blueprint for\
establishing finest homes.\
10:55\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
