My dear brothers\
and sisters, I am\
0:04\
honored to speak at this\
historic general conference\
0:07\
commemorating\
Joseph Smith's First\
0:09\
Vision of God the\
Father and His Son,\
0:12\
Jesus Christ, in what\
is, without question,\
0:16\
a sacred grove.\
0:18\
That vision was a magnificent\
beginning to the Restoration\
0:22\
of the gospel and all that\
unfolded--from the Book\
0:25\
of Mormon to the return of\
priesthood authority and keys\
0:29\
and organization of the Lord's\
true Church, temples of God,\
0:34\
and prophets and apostles who\
lead the work in these latter\
0:38\
days.\
0:40\
By divine design,\
ancient prophets of God,\
0:43\
when moved upon\
by the Holy Ghost,\
0:46\
prophesied of the\
Restoration and what\
0:49\
was to come in our day, the last\
dispensation and the fulness\
0:55\
of times.\
0:56\
The very work "fired the\
souls" of the early seers.\
1:01\
Through generations of time they\
foretold, dreamed, envisioned,\
1:06\
and prophesied of the future\
of God's kingdom on earth,\
1:10\
what Isaiah called "a\
marvellous work and a wonder."\
1:16\
The prophecies that\
have been fulfilled\
1:18\
by the Restoration of the\
fulness of the gospel of Jesus\
1:22\
Christ, including The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
1:26\
Saints, are many.\
1:28\
Today, however, I will highlight\
only a few of my favorites.\
1:34\
These were taught to me by\
my dear Primary teachers\
1:38\
and at the knee of\
my angel mother.\
1:43\
Daniel, who staved off lions\
by his faith in the Lord Jesus\
1:47\
Christ and the intercession\
of God's ministering angels,\
1:51\
was one who saw\
our day in vision.\
1:54\
Interpreting a dream for\
Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar,\
1:59\
Daniel prophesied\
the Lord's Church\
2:01\
would rise in the last days\
as a small stone "cut out\
2:06\
of the mountain without hands."\
2:09\
"Without hands," meaning\
by divine intervention,\
2:13\
the Lord's Church would increase\
in magnitude until it fills\
2:17\
the whole earth, "never\
[to] be destroyed ...\
2:20\
[but to] stand for ever."\
2:23\
It is a profound witness\
that Daniel's words\
2:26\
are being fulfilled as\
members of the Church from all\
2:30\
over the world are\
watching and listening\
2:33\
to the conference today.\
2:36\
The devoted Apostle Peter\
described "times of restitution\
2:41\
of all things ...\
since the world began."\
2:44\
The Apostle Paul wrote that in\
the fulness of times God would\
2:49\
"gather ... in one\
all things in Christ,"\
2:52\
"Jesus Christ himself being\
the chief corner stone."\
2:56\
I felt those\
prophecies so strongly\
3:02\
when I participated in the\
dedication of the Rome Italy\
3:06\
Temple.\
3:07\
All of the prophets\
and apostles were there\
3:10\
bearing testimony\
of Jesus Christ,\
3:13\
the Redeemer of the world,\
as had Peter and Paul.\
3:18\
The Church is a living example\
of that restitution, brothers\
3:22\
and sisters, and our\
members are witnesses\
3:25\
of those divine\
prophecies long ago.\
3:30\
Joseph of Egypt prophesied\
that in the latter days\
3:34\
"a seer shall the\
Lord my God raise up,\
3:37\
who shall be a choice seer\
unto the fruit of my loins."\
3:41\
"For he shall do\
[the Lord's] work."\
3:44\
Joseph Smith, the Prophet of\
the Restoration, was that seer.\
3:51\
John the Revelator prophesied\
of an angel of the Almighty\
3:55\
bringing together important\
elements of the Restoration\
3:59\
with these words: "And I saw\
another angel fly in the midst\
4:04\
of heaven, having the\
everlasting gospel to preach\
4:08\
unto them that dwell on ...\
earth, and to every nation,\
4:11\
and kindred, and\
tongue, and people."\
4:14\
Moroni was that angel.\
4:18\
He saw our day as recorded\
in the Book of Mormon.\
4:21\
In repeated appearances,\
he prepared Joseph Smith\
4:25\
for his ministry,\
including the translation\
4:29\
of the Book of Mormon: Another\
Testament of Jesus Christ.\
4:35\
Other prophets\
foretold of our day.\
4:38\
Malachi spoke of Elijah\
turning "the heart\
4:41\
of the fathers to the children,\
and the heart of the children\
4:44\
to their fathers."\
4:46\
Elijah has come,\
and as a result,\
4:49\
today we have 168 temples\
dotting the earth.\
4:54\
Each temple serves worthy\
members making sacred covenants\
4:59\
and receiving blessed ordinances\
on behalf of themselves\
5:04\
and their deceased ancestors.\
5:06\
This sacred work\
described by Malachi\
5:09\
is "central to the Creator's\
plan for the eternal destiny\
5:15\
of His children."\
5:17\
We live in that\
time prophesied; we\
5:21\
are the people charged\
with ushering in the Second\
5:24\
Coming of Jesus Christ; we are\
to gather God's children, those\
5:29\
who will hear and embrace the\
truths, covenants, and promises\
5:34\
of the everlasting gospel.\
5:36\
President Nelson calls it\
"the greatest challenge,\
5:40\
the greatest cause, and the\
greatest work on [the] earth\
5:44\
today."\
5:45\
Of that miracle I\
bear my witness.\
5:49\
By assignment from\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
5:53\
in February of this year, I\
dedicated the Durban South\
5:57\
Africa Temple.\
5:58\
It was a day I will\
remember all my life.\
6:02\
I was with members who\
have come to the gospel\
6:05\
as Jeremiah prophesied\
long ago: "one of a city,\
6:09\
and two of a family."\
6:11\
The doctrine of Jesus Christ\
unites all of us--around\
6:16\
the world--as sons\
and daughters of God,\
6:19\
as brothers and\
sisters in the gospel.\
6:23\
Regardless of how\
we look or dress,\
6:25\
we are one people with\
a Father in Heaven\
6:29\
whose plan from the\
beginning was and is\
6:34\
for His family to be reunited\
by making and keeping\
6:38\
sacred temple covenants.\
6:42\
To a small gathering\
of priesthood holders\
6:45\
in a schoolhouse in\
Kirtland, Ohio, in 1834,\
6:48\
the Prophet Joseph prophesied,\
"It is only a little handful\
6:54\
of Priesthood you\
see here tonight,\
6:57\
but this Church will fill North\
and South America--it will fill\
7:02\
the world."\
7:04\
In recent years I have\
traveled throughout the world\
7:07\
to meet the members\
of the Church.\
7:09\
My Brethren of the\
Quorum of the Twelve\
7:12\
have had similar assignments.\
7:14\
Still, who can keep up with\
the schedule of our dear\
7:18\
prophet, President Nelson,\
whose travel in his first two\
7:22\
years as President of the\
Church has taken him to meet\
7:26\
with the Saints in "32\
countries and U.S. territories"\
7:32\
to witness of the Living Christ?\
7:35\
I remember when I received my\
mission call as a young man.\
7:39\
I wanted to serve in Germany\
like my father, brother,\
7:43\
and brother-in-law.\
7:45\
Not waiting for anyone to get\
home, I rushed to the mailbox\
7:49\
and opened the call.\
7:51\
I read that I had been called\
to the Eastern States Mission,\
7:55\
headquartered in New York City.\
7:57\
I was disappointed, so I went\
inside and opened my scriptures\
8:03\
for comfort.\
8:04\
I began to read in the\
Doctrine and Covenants,\
8:07\
"Behold, and lo, I have\
much people in this place,\
8:12\
in the regions round about;\
and an effectual door\
8:16\
shall be opened in\
the regions round\
8:18\
about in this eastern land."\
8:24\
That prophecy, given to the\
Prophet Joseph Smith in 1833,\
8:29\
was a revelation to me.\
8:31\
I knew then I had been\
called to the exact mission\
8:35\
the Lord wanted me to serve in.\
8:38\
I taught the Restoration\
and its dramatic beginning,\
8:42\
from when our Father in Heaven\
spoke the words to Joseph Smith\
8:46\
and said, "This\
is My Beloved Son.\
8:50\
Hear Him!"\
8:52\
Of great significance for the\
whole Church is the prophecy\
8:56\
of Isaiah given more than 700\
years before the birth of Jesus\
9:02\
Christ: "And it shall come\
to pass in the last days,\
9:07\
that the mountain of the Lord's\
house shall be established\
9:11\
in the top of the mountains, ...\
and all nations shall flow unto\
9:16\
it."\
9:17\
In my mind today,\
I picture millions\
9:20\
of our members and friends\
connected to these proceedings\
9:24\
electronically by television,\
internet, or other means.\
9:29\
We are sitting\
down as if together\
9:32\
"in the top of the mountains."\
9:34\
It was Brigham Young who\
spoke the prophetic words:\
9:38\
"This is the right place."\
9:41\
The Saints, some of them\
my own pioneer ancestors,\
9:46\
worked to establish Zion\
in the Rocky Mountains\
9:50\
"through the will and\
pleasure of him who dictates\
9:54\
the nations of the earth."\
9:56\
I stand today on the\
sacred ground that\
9:59\
has drawn millions of visitors.\
10:02\
In 2002, Salt Lake City hosted\
the Winter Olympic Games.\
10:08\
The Tabernacle Choir sang\
at the opening ceremonies,\
10:12\
and the Church offered\
concerts and programs\
10:15\
for guests and participants\
from many, many nations.\
10:19\
I will always remember\
seeing the temple\
10:23\
in the background of the nightly\
news broadcasts worldwide.\
10:30\
Over the years, presidents\
of the United States, kings,\
10:35\
judges, prime\
ministers, ambassadors,\
10:37\
and officials from many lands\
have come to Salt Lake City\
10:43\
and met with our leaders.\
10:45\
President Nelson hosted leaders\
of the National Association\
10:50\
for the Advancement\
of Colored People,\
10:52\
a United States\
organization committed\
10:55\
to equal rights without\
discrimination based on race.\
11:00\
I remember standing shoulder\
to shoulder with these friends\
11:05\
and leaders as President\
Nelson joined them\
11:08\
in calling for "greater\
civility and racial harmony\
11:12\
in the world."\
11:14\
Many more have come\
to Temple Square\
11:16\
and met in counsel\
with Church leaders.\
11:18\
For example, this past\
year, to name just a few,\
11:23\
we welcomed the United Nations\
68th Civil Society Conference,\
11:28\
a global gathering and the first\
of its kind outside of New York\
11:32\
City.\
11:33\
We have met with\
Vietnam's Committee\
11:36\
for Religious\
Affairs, ambassadors\
11:38\
from Cuba, the Philippines,\
Argentina, Romania, Sudan,\
11:43\
Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.\
11:46\
We also welcomed the\
secretary general\
11:48\
of the Muslim World League.\
11:52\
What I am describing\
is a fulfillment\
11:55\
of Isaiah's prophecy\
that in the last days,\
11:58\
nations shall flow unto "the\
mountain of the Lord's house."\
12:03\
The great Salt Lake Temple\
stands in the center\
12:07\
of that majesty and glory.\
12:10\
It is not the landscape\
that has drawn people,\
12:13\
though our setting\
is magnificent;\
12:16\
it is the essence of\
pure religion exhibited\
12:19\
in the spirit, growth, goodness,\
and generosity of The Church\
12:24\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints and its people;\
12:29\
our love as God loves; our\
commitment to a higher cause,\
12:34\
what Joseph Smith called\
"the cause of Christ."\
12:40\
We do not know when\
the Savior will return,\
12:43\
but this we do know: we must\
be prepared in heart and mind,\
12:49\
worthy to receive\
Him, and honored\
12:52\
to be part of all that was\
prophesied so long ago.\
12:57\
I testify that President Russell\
M. Nelson is the Lord's prophet\
13:01\
on the earth, and at\
his side are Apostles\
13:04\
called of God, sustained\
as prophets, seers,\
13:08\
and revelators.\
13:09\
And, my dear\
brothers and sisters,\
13:12\
the Restoration continues.\
13:16\
I close with the prophecy\
of Joseph Smith, words\
13:20\
that I testify are true:\
"No unhallowed hand\
13:26\
can stop the work\
from progressing;\
13:28\
persecutions may rage, mobs may\
combine, armies may assemble,\
13:34\
calumny may defame,\
but the truth of God\
13:38\
will go forth boldly,\
nobly, and independent,\
13:42\
till it has penetrated every\
continent, visited every clime,\
13:46\
swept every country, and\
sounded in every ear,\
13:51\
till the purposes of God\
shall be accomplished,\
13:54\
and the Great Jehovah shall\
say the work is done."\
13:58\
I so testify that these\
prophecies of Joseph Smith\
14:02\
are being fulfilled.\
14:05\
I promise as you follow the\
inspired counsel of our dear\
14:09\
prophet, President\
Russell M. Nelson;\
14:11\
his counselors; the Apostles;\
and other Church leaders\
14:16\
and as you pay heed to the\
ancient prophets who foretold\
14:20\
of our day, you will be filled,\
deep in your heart and soul,\
14:24\
with the spirit and the\
work of the Restoration.\
14:28\
I promise you will see the\
hand of God in your lives,\
14:32\
hear His promptings,\
and feel His love.\
14:36\
In the name of Jesus\
Christ, with gratitude\
14:40\
for the Restoration of\
His gospel and His Church,\
14:44\
in evidence of His\
matchless love, amen.\
