I am grateful to be here.\
0:02\
When I first found out I\
would have the opportunity\
0:05\
to speak to you today,\
I felt very excited\
0:08\
but at the same\
time very humbled.\
0:10\
I have spent a lot\
of time thinking\
0:13\
about what I could share, and\
I hope the Spirit speaks to you\
0:16\
directly through my message.\
0:20\
In the Book of Mormon,\
Lehi gives a blessing\
0:22\
to each of his sons\
before he passes away\
0:25\
that helps them to\
see their strengths\
0:28\
and eternal potential.\
0:29\
I am the youngest\
of eight children,\
0:32\
and this past year I have\
been the only child at home\
0:35\
for the first time.\
0:36\
Not having my siblings\
close by or always\
0:39\
having someone to talk\
to has been hard for me.\
0:42\
There have been nights when\
I have felt very lonely.\
0:46\
I'm grateful for my\
parents, who have\
0:48\
tried their best to help me.\
0:50\
An example of this\
is when my dad\
0:52\
offered to give me a\
priesthood blessing of comfort\
0:56\
during a particularly\
challenging time.\
0:58\
After his blessing, things\
didn't change right away,\
1:02\
but I was able to feel peace\
and love from my Heavenly Father\
1:06\
and from my dad.\
1:08\
I feel blessed to have\
a worthy father who\
1:11\
can provide priesthood\
blessings whenever I need them\
1:14\
and who helps me\
to see my strengths\
1:17\
and eternal potential\
just as Lehi did\
1:20\
when he blessed his children.\
1:23\
Regardless of your\
circumstances,\
1:25\
you can always have access\
to priesthood blessings.\
1:28\
Through family members,\
friends, ministering brothers,\
1:31\
priesthood leaders,\
and a Heavenly Father\
1:34\
that will never fail you,\
you can receive the blessings\
1:37\
of the priesthood.\
1:38\
Elder Neil L. Andersen\
said: "The blessings\
1:42\
of the priesthood are infinitely\
greater than the one who is\
1:46\
asked to administer\
the gift. ...\
1:48\
As we are worthy, the\
ordinances of the priesthood\
1:51\
enrich our lives."\
1:54\
Don't hesitate to\
ask for a blessing\
1:56\
when you need extra guidance.\
1:58\
It is in our difficult\
moments that we need\
2:00\
the Spirit to help us the most.\
2:02\
No one is perfect, and we\
all experience hardships.\
2:06\
Some of us might suffer with\
anxiety, depression, addiction,\
2:11\
or with feelings that\
we are not enough.\
2:13\
Priesthood blessings can help\
us overcome these challenges\
2:17\
and receive peace as we move\
forward into the future.\
2:22\
I hope that we strive to\
live worthy of receiving\
2:26\
these blessings.\
2:27\
Another way the\
priesthood blesses\
2:29\
us is through\
patriarchal blessings.\
2:32\
I have learned to turn to\
my patriarchal blessing\
2:36\
whenever I feel sad or lonely.\
2:39\
My blessing helps me\
to see my potential\
2:42\
and the specific\
plan God has for me.\
2:45\
It comforts me and\
helps me to see\
2:48\
beyond my earthly perspective.\
2:50\
It reminds me of my gifts\
and of the blessings\
2:54\
I will receive if I live worthy.\
2:56\
It also helps me to\
remember and feel at peace\
3:00\
that God will provide\
answers and open doors for me\
3:03\
at exactly the right\
moment when I need it most.\
3:08\
Patriarchal blessings\
help us to return\
3:11\
to live with our\
Heavenly Father.\
3:13\
I know patriarchal\
blessings come from God\
3:16\
and can help us turn our\
weaknesses into strengths.\
3:19\
It isn't a message\
from a fortune-teller;\
3:22\
these blessings tell us\
what we need to hear.\
3:25\
They are like a Liahona\
for each one of us.\
3:28\
When we put God first\
and have faith in Him,\
3:31\
He will lead us through\
our own wilderness.\
3:35\
Just like God blessed Joseph\
Smith with the priesthood\
3:38\
so that the blessings of the\
gospel could be restored,\
3:41\
we can receive the blessings\
of the gospel in our lives\
3:44\
through the priesthood.\
3:46\
Each week we are given the\
privilege and opportunity\
3:49\
of taking the sacrament.\
3:51\
Through this\
priesthood ordinance\
3:53\
we have the Spirit to\
always be with us, which\
3:56\
can cleanse and purify us.\
3:58\
If we feel the need to eliminate\
something from our lives,\
4:02\
reach out to a trusted\
leader, who can\
4:05\
help you get on the right path.\
4:08\
Your leaders can\
help you to access\
4:11\
the full power of the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
4:14\
Thanks to the\
priesthood, we can also\
4:16\
receive the blessings of the\
ordinances of the temple.\
4:19\
Ever since I've been\
able to enter the temple,\
4:22\
I have made it a goal and\
priority to attend regularly.\
4:26\
By taking the time and\
making the sacrifices\
4:29\
necessary to be\
closer to my Heavenly\
4:31\
Father in His holy\
house, I have been\
4:33\
blessed with receiving\
revelation and promptings that\
4:37\
have really helped me\
throughout my life.\
4:41\
Through the priesthood\
we can be lifted.\
4:43\
The priesthood brings\
light into our world.\
4:46\
Elder Robert D. Hales\
said: "Without the power\
4:49\
of the priesthood, 'the whole\
earth would be utterly wasted.'\
4:53\
There would be no light,\
no hope--only darkness."\
4:58\
God is cheering for us.\
4:59\
He wants us to return to Him.\
5:01\
He knows us personally.\
5:03\
He knows you.\
5:04\
He loves us.\
5:06\
He is always aware\
of us and blesses us\
5:09\
even when we feel\
we don't deserve it.\
5:12\
He knows what we need\
and when we need it.\
5:16\
"Ask, and it shall be given you;\
seek, and ye shall find; knock,\
5:21\
and it shall be opened unto you:\
5:23\
"For every one that\
asketh receiveth;\
5:25\
and he that seeketh\
findeth; and to him that\
5:29\
knocketh it shall be opened."\
5:31\
If you don't already have a\
testimony about the priesthood,\
5:34\
I encourage you to pray and to\
know for yourself of its power,\
5:39\
then read the scriptures\
to hear God's words.\
5:42\
I know that if we make\
an effort to experience\
5:45\
the power of God's priesthood in\
our lives, we will be blessed.\
5:50\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
