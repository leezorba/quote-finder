Brothers and sisters, our hearts\
have been blessed and renewed\
0:04\
by the Spirit we have felt\
at this general conference.\
0:08\
Two hundred years ago, a pillar\
of light rested on a young man\
0:13\
in a grove of trees.\
0:14\
In that light, Joseph\
Smith saw God the Father\
0:18\
and His Son, Jesus Christ.\
0:20\
Their light drove back the\
spiritual darkness that covered\
0:23\
the earth and pointed the way\
forward for Joseph Smith--and\
0:28\
for all of us.\
0:30\
Because of the light\
revealed that day,\
0:33\
we can receive the\
fulness of blessings\
0:36\
available through the Atonement\
of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
0:40\
By virtue of the\
Restoration of His gospel,\
0:43\
we can be filled with\
the light of the Savior.\
0:46\
However, that light is not\
meant for you and me alone.\
0:51\
Jesus Christ has called upon\
us to "let your light so\
0:56\
shine before this people, that\
they may see your good works\
1:00\
and glorify your Father\
who is in heaven."\
1:02\
I have come to love the\
phrase "that they may see."\
1:08\
It is an earnest\
invitation from the Lord\
1:10\
to be more intentional about\
helping others see the path\
1:15\
and thereby come unto Christ.\
1:18\
When I was 10 years\
old, our family\
1:20\
had the honor of\
hosting Elder L. Tom\
1:23\
Perry of the Quorum\
of the Twelve Apostles\
1:25\
while he was on\
assignment in my hometown.\
1:29\
At the close of the day,\
our family and the Perrys\
1:31\
sat down in our living room\
to enjoy my mother's delicious\
1:36\
apple pie while Elder\
Perry recounted stories\
1:39\
about the Saints\
around the world.\
1:42\
I was enthralled.\
1:44\
It was getting late\
when my mother called me\
1:46\
into the kitchen and asked\
a simple question: "Bonnie,\
1:51\
did you feed the chickens?"\
1:53\
My heart fell; I had not.\
1:56\
Not wanting to\
leave the presence\
1:58\
of an Apostle of the Lord, I\
suggested that the chickens\
2:02\
could fast until morning.\
2:04\
My mother replied with\
a definitive "no."\
2:07\
Just then, Elder Perry\
entered the kitchen\
2:10\
and with his booming,\
enthusiastic voice\
2:13\
asked, "Did I hear someone\
needs to feed the chickens?\
2:17\
Can my son and I join you?"\
2:19\
Oh, what an absolute joy it now\
became to feed the chickens!\
2:24\
I ran to get the large\
yellow flashlight.\
2:26\
Excited, I led out, skipping\
over the well-worn path\
2:30\
to the chicken coop.\
2:31\
With the flashlight\
swinging from my hand,\
2:34\
we crossed the corn patch and\
passed through the wheat field.\
2:38\
Reaching the small irrigation\
ditch that crossed the path,\
2:41\
I instinctively\
jumped over it as I\
2:44\
had done many nights before.\
2:46\
I was oblivious to\
Elder Perry's efforts\
2:49\
to keep up on a\
dark, unknown path.\
2:53\
My dancing light did not\
help him see the ditch.\
2:57\
Without the steady\
light to see, he\
2:59\
stepped directly into the\
water and let out a loud groan.\
3:03\
Panicked, I turned to\
see my new friend remove\
3:07\
his soaking wet\
foot from the ditch\
3:10\
and shaking the water from\
his heavy leather shoe.\
3:14\
With a soaked and\
sloshing shoe, Elder Perry\
3:17\
helped me feed the chickens.\
3:19\
When we were through, he\
lovingly instructed, "Bonnie,\
3:24\
I need to see the path.\
3:26\
I need the light to shine\
where I am walking."\
3:30\
I was shining my\
light but not in a way\
3:33\
that would help Elder Perry.\
3:35\
Now, knowing that he needed\
my light to safely navigate\
3:39\
the path, I focused the\
flashlight just ahead\
3:42\
of his steps and we were able\
to return home with confidence.\
3:47\
My dear brothers and\
sisters, for years\
3:50\
I have pondered the principle\
I had learned from Elder Perry.\
3:54\
The Lord's invitation to let\
our light so shine is not just\
3:59\
about randomly waving a beam\
of light and making the world\
4:02\
generally brighter.\
4:04\
It is about focusing\
our light so others\
4:07\
may see the way to Christ.\
4:09\
It is gathering Israel on\
this side of the veil--helping\
4:15\
others see the next step forward\
in making and keeping sacred\
4:19\
covenants with God.\
4:22\
The Savior testified,\
"Behold I am the light;\
4:27\
I have set an example for you."\
4:30\
Let's look at one\
of His examples.\
4:33\
The woman at the\
well was a Samaritan\
4:35\
who did not know\
Jesus Christ and was\
4:38\
viewed by many as an\
outcast in her own society.\
4:42\
Jesus met her and\
initiated a conversation.\
4:46\
He spoke to her of water and\
then led her to increased light\
4:50\
as He declared Himself\
to be the "living water."\
4:56\
Jesus was compassionately\
aware of her and her needs.\
5:00\
He met the woman where\
she was and started\
5:03\
by talking about something\
familiar and common.\
5:07\
If He had stopped\
there, it would\
5:09\
have been a positive encounter.\
5:11\
But it would not have resulted\
in her going to the city\
5:15\
to proclaim, "Come, see ...\
: is not this the Christ?"\
5:22\
Gradually, through\
the conversation,\
5:25\
she discovered Jesus Christ,\
and despite her past,\
5:28\
she became an\
instrument of light,\
5:31\
shining the way\
for others to see.\
5:34\
Now let's look at two people\
who followed the Savior's\
5:37\
example of shining light.\
5:39\
Recently, my friend Kevin\
was seated next to a business\
5:42\
executive at dinner.\
5:44\
He worried what to talk\
about for two hours.\
5:48\
Following a prompting,\
Kevin asked,\
5:51\
"Tell me about your family.\
5:52\
Where do they come from?"\
5:54\
The gentleman knew little\
about his heritage,\
5:57\
so Kevin pulled out\
his phone, saying,\
6:00\
"I have an app that connects\
people to their families.\
6:03\
Let's see what we can find."\
6:06\
After a lengthy discussion,\
Kevin's new friend\
6:10\
asked, "Why is family so\
important to your church?"\
6:14\
Kevin answered simply,\
"We believe that we\
6:17\
continue to live after we die.\
6:19\
...\
6:20\
If we identify our ancestors\
and take their names\
6:23\
to a sacred place\
called a temple,\
6:26\
we can perform\
marriage ordinances\
6:28\
that will keep our families\
together even after death."\
6:33\
Kevin started with something\
he and his new friend\
6:36\
had in common.\
6:37\
He then found a way to witness\
of the Savior's light and love.\
6:43\
The second story is about Ella,\
a collegiate basketball player.\
6:46\
Her example began when she\
received her mission call\
6:50\
while she was away at school.\
6:52\
She chose to open her\
call in front of her team.\
6:56\
They knew almost nothing about\
the Church of Jesus Christ\
7:00\
and didn't understand\
Ella's desire to serve.\
7:04\
She prayed repeatedly how\
to explain her mission\
7:08\
call in a way that the\
teammates may feel the Spirit.\
7:12\
Her answer?\
7:14\
"I made a PowerPoint,"\
Ella said,\
7:17\
"because I'm just that cool."\
7:19\
She told them\
about the potential\
7:21\
of serving in one\
of 400-plus missions\
7:25\
and possibly\
learning a language.\
7:27\
She highlighted the thousands\
of missionaries already serving.\
7:31\
Ella ended with a\
picture of the Savior\
7:34\
and this brief\
testimony: "Basketball\
7:38\
is one of the most\
important things in my life.\
7:40\
I moved across the\
country and [I]\
7:43\
left my family to play for\
this coach and with this team.\
7:47\
The only two things\
that are more\
7:49\
important to me than basketball\
are my faith and my family."\
7:55\
Now, in case you are thinking,\
"These are great 1,000-watt\
7:59\
examples, but I'm\
a 20-watt bulb,"\
8:03\
remember that the\
Savior testified,\
8:06\
"I am the light which\
ye shall hold up."\
8:10\
He reminds us that He will\
bring the light if we will just\
8:14\
point others to Him.\
8:16\
You and I have enough\
light to share right now.\
8:21\
We can light the next\
step to help someone draw\
8:24\
nearer to Jesus Christ and then\
the next step and the next.\
8:30\
Ask yourself, "Who needs the\
light you have to find the path\
8:35\
they need but cannot see?"\
8:39\
My dear friends, why is\
shining our light so important?\
8:43\
The Lord has told us that "there\
are many yet on the earth ...\
8:47\
who are only kept from the truth\
because they know not where\
8:52\
to find it."\
8:53\
We can help.\
8:55\
We can intentionally shine\
our light so others may see.\
8:59\
We can extend an invitation.\
9:02\
We can walk the\
journey with those\
9:04\
who are taking a step toward the\
Savior, no matter how halting.\
9:08\
We can gather Israel.\
9:11\
I testify the Lord will\
magnify every small effort.\
9:15\
The Holy Ghost will prompt us\
to know what to say and do.\
9:19\
Such attempts may require us to\
step out of our comfort zone,\
9:24\
but we can be assured that the\
Lord will help our light shine.\
9:29\
How grateful I am for\
the Savior's light,\
9:33\
which continues to lead this\
Church through revelation.\
9:37\
I invite all of us to follow\
the example of Jesus Christ\
9:41\
and be compassionately\
aware of those around us.\
9:45\
Look and pray for\
opportunities to let your light\
9:48\
shine that others may see\
the way to Jesus Christ.\
9:52\
His promise is great: "He that\
followeth me shall not walk\
9:58\
in darkness, but shall\
have ... light of life."\
10:02\
I testify that our\
Savior, Jesus Christ,\
10:05\
is the Way, the Truth, the Life,\
Light, and Love of the World.\
10:10\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
