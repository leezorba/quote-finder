Throughout time, even and\
especially during difficult\
0:05\
times, prophets\
have encouraged us\
0:08\
to remember the greatness\
of God and to consider\
0:12\
what He has done for us as\
individuals, as families,\
0:16\
and as a people.\
0:17\
This direction is found\
throughout the scriptures\
0:20\
but is notably prominent\
in the Book of Mormon.\
0:23\
The title page explains that\
one of the Book of Mormon's\
0:27\
purposes is "to show unto the\
remnant of the house of Israel\
0:31\
what great things the Lord\
hath done for their fathers."\
0:34\
The Book of Mormon's conclusion\
includes Moroni's appeal:\
0:38\
"Behold, I would exhort you that\
when ye shall read these things\
0:43\
... that ye would remember how\
merciful the Lord hath been\
0:46\
unto the children of men, ...\
and ponder it in your hearts."\
0:51\
The consistency of\
pleas from prophets\
0:54\
to reflect on the goodness\
of God is striking.\
0:57\
Our Heavenly Father wants us\
to recall His and His Beloved\
1:01\
Son's goodness, not for\
Their own gratification\
1:06\
but for the influence such\
remembrance has on us.\
1:09\
By considering Their\
kindness, our perspective\
1:13\
and understanding are enlarged.\
1:15\
By reflecting on\
Their compassion,\
1:18\
we become more humble,\
prayerful, and steadfast.\
1:24\
A poignant experience\
with a former patient\
1:26\
shows how gratitude for\
generosity and compassion\
1:29\
can transform us.\
1:33\
In 1987 I became acquainted\
with Thomas Nielson,\
1:35\
a remarkable man who\
needed a heart transplant.\
1:39\
He was 63 years old and\
lived in Logan, Utah,\
1:42\
in the United States.\
1:44\
Following military service\
during World War II,\
1:47\
he married Donna Wilkes\
in the Logan Utah Temple.\
1:50\
He became an energetic and\
successful brick mason.\
1:55\
In later years he\
especially enjoyed\
1:58\
working with his oldest\
grandchild, Jonathan,\
2:00\
during school vacations.\
2:02\
The two developed\
a special bond,\
2:05\
in part because Tom saw\
much of himself in Jonathan.\
2:11\
Tom found waiting for a\
donor heart frustrating.\
2:15\
He was not a\
particularly patient man.\
2:17\
He had always been able\
to set and achieve goals\
2:20\
through hard work and\
sheer determination.\
2:23\
Struggling with heart failure,\
with his life on hold,\
2:27\
Tom sometimes\
asked me what I was\
2:30\
doing to speed up the process.\
2:32\
Jokingly, he suggested\
avenues I could\
2:35\
pursue that would make a donor\
heart available to him sooner.\
2:40\
One joyous yet dreadful\
day, an ideal donor heart\
2:45\
became available for Tom.\
2:48\
The size and blood\
type were a match,\
2:51\
and the donor was young,\
just 16 years old.\
2:55\
The donor heart\
belonged to Jonathan,\
3:00\
Tom's beloved grandson.\
3:02\
Earlier that day, Jonathan\
had been fatally injured\
3:06\
when the car in\
which he was riding\
3:07\
was struck by a passing train.\
3:11\
When I visited Tom and\
Donna in the hospital,\
3:13\
they were distraught.\
3:14\
It is hard to imagine what\
they were going through,\
3:18\
knowing that Tom's life\
could be extended by using\
3:21\
their grandson's heart.\
3:23\
At first, they refused to\
consider the proffered heart\
3:28\
from Jonathan's\
grieving parents,\
3:30\
their daughter and son-in-law.\
3:33\
Tom and Donna knew, though,\
that Jonathan was brain dead\
3:37\
and came to understand that\
their prayers for a donor\
3:40\
heart for Tom had not\
caused Jonathan's accident.\
3:43\
No, Jonathan's heart\
was a gift that could\
3:47\
bless Tom in his time of need.\
3:49\
They recognized that\
something good might come out\
3:53\
of this tragedy and\
decided to proceed.\
3:57\
The transplant\
procedures went well.\
4:00\
Afterward, Tom was\
a different man.\
4:04\
The change went beyond improved\
health or even gratitude.\
4:09\
He told me that he reflected\
every morning on Jonathan,\
4:13\
on his daughter and son-in-law,\
on the gift he had received,\
4:18\
and on what that\
gift had entailed.\
4:21\
Even though his innate good\
humor and grit were still\
4:24\
readily apparent, I observed\
that Tom was more solemn,\
4:28\
thoughtful, and kindhearted.\
4:32\
Tom lived an additional 13 years\
after the transplant, years he\
4:36\
otherwise would not have had.\
4:38\
His obituary stated\
that these years\
4:41\
allowed him to touch the\
lives of his family and others\
4:44\
with generosity and love.\
4:46\
He was a private\
benefactor and an example\
4:49\
of optimism and determination.\
4:53\
Much like Tom, each of\
us has received gifts\
4:57\
that we could not provide\
for ourselves, gifts\
5:01\
from our Heavenly Father\
and His Beloved Son,\
5:04\
including redemption\
through the atoning\
5:06\
sacrifice of Jesus Christ.\
5:08\
We have received\
life in this world;\
5:11\
we will receive physical\
life in the hereafter,\
5:14\
and eternal salvation and\
exaltation--if we choose\
5:18\
it--all because of Heavenly\
Father and Jesus Christ.\
5:23\
Every time we use, benefit from,\
or even think of these gifts,\
5:28\
we ought to consider the\
sacrifice, generosity,\
5:32\
and compassion of the givers.\
5:34\
Reverence for the givers\
does more than just\
5:37\
make us grateful.\
5:38\
Reflecting on Their gifts\
can and should transform us.\
5:44\
One remarkable transformation\
was that of Alma the Younger.\
5:48\
As Alma was "going about\
rebelling against God,"\
5:51\
an angel appeared.\
5:52\
With "a voice of\
thunder," the angel\
5:55\
chastised Alma for\
persecuting the church\
5:58\
and "stealing away the\
hearts of the people."\
6:00\
The angel added this\
admonition: "Go,\
6:04\
and remember the captivity\
of thy fathers ... ;\
6:08\
and remember how great things\
[God] has done for them."\
6:11\
Of all possible\
exhortations, that\
6:15\
was what the angel emphasized.\
6:18\
Alma repented and remembered.\
6:22\
He later shared the\
angel's admonition\
6:24\
with his son Helaman.\
6:26\
Alma counseled, "I would that\
ye should do as I have done,\
6:32\
in remembering the\
captivity of our fathers;\
6:35\
for they were in bondage, and\
none could deliver them except\
6:39\
it was the God of Abraham, ...\
6:41\
Isaac, and ...\
6:41\
Jacob; and he surely did deliver\
them in their afflictions."\
6:46\
Alma said, simply, "I\
do put my trust in him."\
6:50\
Alma understood that by\
remembering deliverance\
6:54\
from bondage and support\
during "trials and troubles\
6:57\
of every kind," we\
come to know God\
7:00\
and the surety of His promises.\
7:04\
Few of us have an experience\
as dramatic as Alma's, yet\
7:08\
our transformation can\
be equally profound.\
7:12\
The Savior pledged anciently:\
7:16\
"A new heart also\
will I give you,\
7:18\
and a new spirit will\
I put within you:\
7:20\
and I will take away\
the stony heart ...\
7:23\
and I will give you\
an heart of flesh.\
7:26\
"And I will put my\
spirit within you. ...\
7:27\
"...\
7:28\
And ye shall be my people,\
and I will be your God."\
7:34\
The resurrected Savior\
told the Nephites\
7:36\
how this transformation begins.\
7:39\
He identified a pivotal feature\
in Heavenly Father's plan\
7:43\
when He said:\
7:43\
"And my Father sent me that\
I might be lifted up upon\
7:48\
the cross; and after that I had\
been lifted up upon the cross,\
7:52\
that I might draw\
all men unto me. ...\
7:55\
"And for this cause have I\
been lifted up; therefore,\
7:59\
according to the\
power of the Father\
8:01\
I will draw all men unto me."\
8:06\
What does it take for you\
to be drawn to the Savior?\
8:11\
Consider Jesus\
Christ's submission\
8:14\
to His Father's\
will, His victory\
8:17\
over death, His taking upon\
Himself your sins and mistakes,\
8:22\
His receiving power\
from the Father\
8:24\
to make intercession for you,\
and His ultimate redemption\
8:28\
of you.\
8:30\
Are these things not\
sufficient to draw you to Him?\
8:35\
They are for me.\
8:37\
Jesus Christ "stands\
with open arms, hoping\
8:42\
and willing to heal, forgive,\
cleanse, strengthen, purify,\
8:48\
and sanctify [you and me]."\
8:53\
These truths should\
give us a new heart\
8:56\
and prompt us to choose\
to follow Heavenly\
8:58\
Father and Jesus Christ.\
9:01\
Yet even new hearts may\
be "prone to wander, ...\
9:05\
prone to leave the\
God [we] love."\
9:08\
To fight this tendency, we\
need to reflect every day\
9:13\
on the gifts we have received\
and on what they entailed.\
9:17\
King Benjamin counseled, "I\
would that ye should remember,\
9:20\
and always retain\
in remembrance,\
9:22\
the greatness of God ... and\
his goodness and long-suffering\
9:26\
towards you."\
9:27\
If we do so, we qualify for\
remarkable heavenly blessings.\
9:33\
Reflecting on God's\
goodness and mercy\
9:35\
helps us become more\
spiritually receptive.\
9:38\
In turn, increased\
spiritual sensitivity\
9:41\
allows us to come to know\
the truth of all things\
9:43\
by the power of the Holy Ghost.\
9:45\
This includes a testimony\
of the truthfulness\
9:48\
of the Book of Mormon,\
knowing that Jesus\
9:50\
is the Christ, our personal\
Savior and Redeemer,\
9:54\
and accepting that\
His gospel has been\
9:56\
restored in these latter days.\
9:59\
When we remember the greatness\
of our Heavenly Father\
10:02\
and Jesus Christ and what\
They have done for us,\
10:05\
we will not take\
Them for granted,\
10:07\
just as Tom did not take\
Jonathan's heart for granted.\
10:12\
In a joyful and\
reverent way, Tom\
10:16\
remembered each day the tragedy\
that brought him extended life.\
10:21\
In the exuberance\
of knowing that we\
10:24\
can be saved and\
exalted, we need\
10:27\
to remember that salvation\
and exaltation came\
10:30\
at a great cost.\
10:32\
We can be reverently\
joyful as we realize\
10:36\
that without Jesus\
Christ we are doomed,\
10:38\
but with Him we can\
receive the greatest\
10:41\
gift Heavenly Father can give.\
10:43\
Indeed, this reverence allows\
us to enjoy the promise\
10:47\
"of eternal life in this world"\
and eventually receive "eternal\
10:51\
life ...\
10:52\
even immortal glory,"\
in the world to come.\
10:57\
When we consider the goodness\
of our Heavenly Father and Jesus\
11:00\
Christ, our trust\
in Them increases.\
11:03\
Our prayers change because\
we know God is our Father\
11:06\
and we are His children.\
11:08\
We seek not to change His will\
but align our will with His\
11:13\
and secure for\
ourselves blessings\
11:14\
that He wants to\
grant, conditioned\
11:16\
on our asking for them.\
11:18\
We yearn to be more meek,\
more pure, more steadfast,\
11:25\
more Christlike.\
11:27\
These changes qualify us for\
additional heavenly blessings.\
11:32\
By acknowledging that every good\
thing comes from Jesus Christ,\
11:36\
we will communicate our faith\
more effectively to others.\
11:39\
We will have courage\
when confronted\
11:42\
with seemingly impossible\
tasks and circumstances.\
11:46\
We will strengthen our resolve\
to keep the covenants we\
11:49\
have made to follow the Savior.\
11:50\
We will be filled\
with the love of God,\
11:54\
want to help those in need\
without being judgmental,\
11:58\
love our children and raise\
them in righteousness,\
12:02\
retain a remission of our\
sins, and always rejoice.\
12:08\
These are the remarkable fruits\
of remembering God's goodness\
12:13\
and mercy.\
12:16\
In contrast, the Savior\
warned, "In nothing doth man\
12:20\
offend God, or against\
none is his wrath kindled,\
12:23\
save those who confess not\
his hand in all things."\
12:27\
I do not think that God is\
insulted when we forget Him.\
12:30\
Rather, I think He is\
deeply disappointed.\
12:34\
He knows that we have deprived\
ourselves of the opportunity\
12:37\
to draw closer to\
Him by remembering\
12:40\
Him and His goodness.\
12:41\
We then miss out on\
Him drawing nearer\
12:44\
to us and the specific\
blessings He has promised.\
12:49\
I invite you to remember each\
day the greatness of Heavenly\
12:54\
Father and Jesus Christ and\
what They have done for you.\
12:57\
Let your consideration of\
Their goodness more firmly\
13:01\
bind your wandering\
heart to Them.\
13:04\
Ponder Their\
compassion, and you will\
13:07\
be blessed with added\
spiritual sensitivity\
13:10\
and become more Christlike.\
13:12\
Contemplating Their\
empathy will help\
13:15\
you "hold out\
faithful to the end,"\
13:18\
until you "are\
received into heaven"\
13:20\
to "dwell with God in a state\
of never-ending happiness."\
13:25\
Our Heavenly Father,\
referring to His Beloved Son,\
13:29\
said, "Hear Him!"\
13:32\
As you act on those words\
and listen to Him, remember,\
13:37\
joyfully and reverently, that\
the Savior loves to restore\
13:42\
what you cannot restore; He\
loves to heal wounds you cannot\
13:47\
heal; He loves to fix what\
has been irreparably broken;\
13:52\
He compensates for any\
unfairness inflicted on you;\
13:56\
and He loves to permanently\
mend even shattered hearts.\
14:02\
As I have reflected on gifts\
from our Heavenly Father\
14:05\
and from Jesus\
Christ, I have come\
14:08\
to know of Their infinite love\
and Their incomprehensible\
14:11\
compassion for all\
Heavenly Father's children.\
14:14\
This knowledge has changed me,\
and it will change you too.\
14:20\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
