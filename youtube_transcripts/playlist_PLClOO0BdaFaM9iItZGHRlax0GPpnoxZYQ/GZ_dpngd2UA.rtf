I'm grateful to focus my remarks\
today on women's continuing\
0:05\
roles in the Restoration.\
0:07\
It is clear that\
throughout history women\
0:10\
have held a distinctive place\
in our Heavenly Father's plan.\
0:14\
President Russell\
M. Nelson taught,\
0:16\
"It would be impossible to\
measure the influence that ...\
0:19\
women have, not only on families\
but also on the Lord's Church,\
0:24\
as wives, mothers,\
and grandmothers;\
0:27\
as sisters and aunts;\
as teachers and leaders;\
0:31\
and especially as exemplars and\
devout defenders of the faith."\
0:38\
In the early Relief\
Society in Nauvoo,\
0:40\
178 years ago, the\
Prophet Joseph Smith\
0:44\
counseled the sisters to "live\
up to [their] privileges."\
0:48\
Their example teaches us today.\
0:52\
They unitedly followed\
a prophet's voice\
0:55\
and lived with steadfast\
faith in Jesus Christ\
0:58\
as they helped lay the\
foundation we now stand upon.\
1:02\
Sisters, it is our turn.\
1:06\
We have a divine\
errand from the Lord,\
1:09\
and our faithful, unique\
contributions are vital.\
1:15\
President Spencer W.\
Kimball explained:\
1:17\
"To be a righteous woman\
during the winding up scenes\
1:20\
on this earth, before the\
second coming of our Savior,\
1:24\
is an especially noble calling.\
1:28\
The righteous woman's\
strength and influence today\
1:30\
can be tenfold what it might\
be in more tranquil times."\
1:37\
President Nelson has\
likewise implored:\
1:40\
"I plead with my sisters\
of [the] Church ...\
1:43\
to step forward!\
1:44\
Take your rightful and\
needful place in your home,\
1:48\
in your community, and in the\
kingdom of God--more than you\
1:52\
ever have before."\
1:57\
Recently, I was privileged,\
along with a group\
1:59\
of Primary children, to meet\
with President Russell M.\
2:03\
Nelson in the replica\
of the Smith family home\
2:06\
in Palmyra, New York.\
2:08\
Listen as our prophet\
teaches the children what\
2:12\
they can do to step forward.\
2:14\
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]\
2:16\
I'm curious to know if you might\
have a question that you would\
2:21\
like to ask President Nelson.\
2:22\
You're sitting here\
with the prophet.\
2:25\
Is there anything that you've\
always wanted to ask a prophet?\
2:30\
Yes, Pearl.\
2:33\
Is it hard to be a prophet?\
2:35\
Are you, like, really busy?\
2:38\
Of course it's hard.\
2:40\
Everything to do with becoming\
more like the Savior is\
2:47\
difficult. For example,\
when God wanted\
2:51\
to give the Ten\
Commandments to Moses,\
2:53\
where did He tell Moses to go?\
2:56\
Up on top of a mountain,\
on the top of Mount Sinai.\
3:00\
So Moses had to walk all the way\
up to the top of that mountain\
3:03\
to get the Ten Commandments.\
3:05\
Now, Heavenly Father could have\
said, "Moses, you start there,\
3:10\
and I'll start here, and\
I'll meet you halfway."\
3:12\
[LAUGHING]\
3:14\
No, the Lord loves effort,\
because effort brings rewards\
3:23\
that can't come without it.\
3:26\
For example, did you\
ever take piano lessons?\
3:29\
Yes, I take piano lessons.\
3:30\
I take violin.\
3:31\
And do you practice?\
3:33\
Yes.\
3:33\
What happens if\
you don't practice?\
3:35\
You forget.\
3:36\
Yes, you don't progress, do you?\
3:37\
So, the answer is yes, Pearl.\
3:40\
It takes effort, a\
lot of hard work,\
3:45\
a lot of study--and\
there's never an end.\
3:51\
That's good!\
3:52\
That's good because\
we're always progressing.\
3:55\
Even in the next life\
we're making progress.\
3:57\
[END PLAYBACK]\
4:01\
President Nelson's response\
to these precious children\
4:04\
extends to each of us.\
4:06\
The Lord loves effort,\
and effort brings rewards.\
4:11\
We keep practicing.\
4:12\
We are always\
progressing as long\
4:15\
as we are striving\
to follow the Lord.\
4:18\
He doesn't expect\
perfection today.\
4:20\
We keep climbing our\
personal Mount Sinai.\
4:25\
As in times past, our\
journey does indeed\
4:29\
take effort, hard\
work, and study,\
4:32\
but our commitment to progress\
brings eternal rewards.\
4:37\
What more do we learn\
from the Prophet Joseph\
4:39\
Smith and the First Vision about\
effort, hard work, and study?\
4:44\
The First Vision\
gives us direction\
4:46\
in our unique, continuing roles.\
4:49\
As women of faith, we can\
draw principles of truth\
4:52\
from the Prophet\
Joseph's experiences\
4:55\
that provide insights for\
receiving our own revelation.\
4:59\
For example:\
5:01\
We labor under difficulties.\
5:04\
We turn to the scriptures\
to receive wisdom to act.\
5:08\
We demonstrate our\
faith and trust in God.\
5:12\
We exert our power\
to plead with God\
5:15\
to help us thwart the\
adversary's influence.\
5:19\
We offer up the desires\
of our hearts to God.\
5:23\
We focus on His light\
guiding our life choices\
5:26\
and resting upon us\
when we turn to Him.\
5:30\
We realize He knows\
each of us by name\
5:35\
and has individual\
roles for us to fulfill.\
5:40\
In addition, Joseph Smith\
restored the knowledge\
5:43\
that we have divine\
potential and eternal worth.\
5:46\
Because of that relationship\
with our Heavenly Father,\
5:49\
I believe He expects us to\
receive revelation from Him.\
5:56\
The Lord instructed Emma Smith\
to "receive the Holy Ghost,"\
5:59\
learn much, "lay aside the\
things of this world, ...\
6:03\
seek for the things\
of a better,"\
6:04\
and "cleave unto [her]\
covenants" with God.\
6:08\
Learning is integral\
to progression,\
6:11\
especially as the constant\
companionship of the Holy Ghost\
6:15\
teaches us what is needful\
for each of us to lay\
6:20\
aside--meaning that which\
could distract us or delay\
6:24\
our progression.\
6:27\
President Nelson said,\
"I plead with you\
6:30\
to increase your\
spiritual capacity\
6:32\
to receive revelation."\
6:35\
Our prophet's words\
are continually with me\
6:39\
as I contemplate women's\
ability to step forward.\
6:43\
He pleads with us, which\
indicates priority.\
6:47\
He is teaching us how to survive\
spiritually in a sin-sick world\
6:53\
by receiving and\
acting on revelation.\
6:56\
As we do so, honoring and\
living the Lord's commandments,\
7:01\
we are promised,\
even as Emma Smith,\
7:03\
"a crown of righteousness."\
7:06\
The Prophet Joseph\
taught of the importance\
7:09\
of knowing that the path we\
are pursuing in this lifetime\
7:12\
is approved of God.\
7:14\
Without that knowledge, we\
"will grow weary in [our] minds,\
7:18\
and faint."\
7:21\
In this conference,\
we will hear truths\
7:23\
that inspire us to change,\
improve, and purify our lives.\
7:28\
Through personal revelation,\
we can prevent what some call\
7:32\
"general conference\
overwhelm"--when we leave\
7:35\
determined to do it all now.\
7:39\
Women wear many hats, but it\
is impossible, and unnecessary,\
7:45\
to wear them all at once.\
7:47\
The Spirit helps us determine\
which work to focus on today.\
7:53\
The Lord's loving influence\
through the Holy Ghost\
7:56\
helps us know His priority\
for our progression.\
8:00\
Heeding personal revelation\
leads to personal progression.\
8:05\
We listen and act.\
8:08\
The Lord said, "Ask the\
Father in my name in faith,\
8:13\
believing that\
you shall receive,\
8:15\
and you shall have\
the Holy Ghost,\
8:17\
which manifesteth all\
things which are expedient."\
8:23\
Our continuing role is to\
receive continuing revelation.\
8:30\
As we attain a greater degree of\
proficiency at doing so, we can\
8:35\
receive more power in our\
individual roles to minister\
8:38\
and accomplish the work of\
salvation and exaltation--to\
8:42\
truly "lay aside the\
things of this world,\
8:46\
and seek for the\
things of a better."\
8:48\
We can then more effectively\
inspire our rising generation\
8:54\
to do the same.\
8:56\
Brothers and sisters, we all\
seek God's power in our lives.\
9:00\
There is beautiful unity\
between women and men\
9:04\
in accomplishing\
God's work today.\
9:07\
We access the power of the\
priesthood through covenants,\
9:11\
made first in the\
waters of baptism\
9:14\
and then within the\
walls of holy temples.\
9:17\
President Nelson taught us,\
"Every woman and every man who\
9:21\
makes covenants with God\
and keeps those covenants,\
9:24\
and who participates worthily\
in priesthood ordinances,\
9:28\
has direct access to\
the power of God."\
9:34\
My personal admission\
today is that as a woman\
9:38\
I didn't realize\
earlier in my life\
9:41\
that I had access,\
through my covenants,\
9:45\
to the power of the priesthood.\
9:48\
Sisters, I pray that we\
will recognize and cherish\
9:51\
priesthood power as we "cleave\
unto [our] covenants," embrace\
9:56\
the truths of the\
scriptures, and heed\
9:58\
the words of our\
living prophets.\
10:01\
Let us boldly\
declare our devotion\
10:04\
to our Heavenly\
Father and our Savior,\
10:06\
"with unshaken faith\
in him, relying wholly\
10:11\
upon the merits of him\
who is mighty to save."\
10:15\
Let us joyfully continue this\
journey toward our highest\
10:19\
spiritual potential and\
help those around us\
10:23\
to do the same through\
leadership, love, service,\
10:27\
and compassion.\
10:31\
Elder James E. Talmage\
tenderly reminded us,\
10:34\
"The world's greatest champion\
of woman and womanhood\
10:38\
is Jesus the Christ."\
10:43\
In the final analysis of\
women's continuing roles\
10:46\
in the Restoration, and for us\
all, what role is preeminent?\
10:52\
I testify that it is to\
hear Him, to follow Him,\
10:57\
to trust Him, and to become\
an extension of His love.\
11:03\
I know He lives.\
11:06\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
