Dear, wonderful\
sisters and brothers,\
0:03\
it is a delight to\
be with you tonight.\
0:05\
Wherever you're listening,\
I extend hugs to my sisters\
0:10\
and heartfelt handshakes\
to my brothers.\
0:14\
We are united in the\
work of the Lord.\
0:18\
When we think of Adam and\
Eve, often our first thought\
0:21\
is of their idyllic life\
in the Garden of Eden.\
0:24\
I imagine that the weather was\
always perfect--not too hot\
0:28\
and not too cold--and\
that abundant,\
0:30\
delicious fruits and vegetables\
grew within reach so they could\
0:33\
eat whenever they liked.\
0:35\
Since this was a\
new world for them,\
0:37\
there was much to discover,\
so every day was interesting\
0:40\
as they interacted\
with the animal life\
0:42\
and explored their\
beautiful surroundings.\
0:44\
They also were given\
commandments to obey\
0:47\
and had different\
ways of approaching\
0:49\
those instructions, which\
caused some initial anxiety\
0:52\
and confusion.\
0:53\
But as they made decisions that\
changed their lives forever,\
0:57\
they learned to work\
together and became united\
1:00\
in accomplishing the purposes\
God had for them--and for all\
1:04\
of His children.\
1:05\
Now picture this same\
couple in mortality.\
1:08\
They had to labor for their\
food, some of the animals\
1:11\
considered them food, and\
there were difficult challenges\
1:14\
that could be overcome\
only as they counseled\
1:17\
and prayed together.\
1:18\
I imagine that\
there were at least\
1:20\
a few times they had\
differing opinions about how\
1:22\
to approach those challenges.\
1:24\
However, through\
the Fall, they had\
1:27\
learned that it was essential\
to act in unity and love.\
1:30\
In the tutoring they\
received from divine sources,\
1:33\
they were taught the\
plan of salvation\
1:35\
and the principles of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ that\
1:38\
make the plan operable.\
1:40\
Because they understood\
that their earthly purpose\
1:43\
and eternal goal\
were identical, they\
1:46\
found satisfaction and success\
in learning to labor in love\
1:50\
and righteousness together.\
1:53\
As children were born\
to them, Adam and Eve\
1:55\
taught their family\
what they had learned\
1:57\
from heavenly messengers.\
1:58\
They were focused on\
helping their children also\
2:01\
understand and embrace\
those principles that\
2:04\
would make them\
happy in this life,\
2:06\
as well as prepared to return\
to their Heavenly Parents\
2:09\
after having increased\
their abilities\
2:11\
and proved their\
obedience to God.\
2:13\
In the process,\
Adam and Eve learned\
2:15\
to appreciate their\
differing strengths\
2:18\
and supported one another in\
their eternally significant\
2:21\
work.\
2:23\
As centuries and then\
millennia came and went,\
2:25\
the clarity of men's\
and women's inspired\
2:28\
and interdependent\
contributions became clouded\
2:31\
with misinformation\
and misunderstandings.\
2:34\
During the time between\
that marvelous beginning\
2:37\
in the Garden of Eden\
and now, the adversary\
2:40\
has been quite successful in\
his goal to divide men and women\
2:43\
in his attempts to\
conquer our souls.\
2:45\
Lucifer knows that if he\
can damage the unity men\
2:49\
and women feel, if\
he can confuse us\
2:52\
about our divine worth and\
covenant responsibilities,\
2:55\
he will succeed in\
destroying families,\
2:57\
which are the essential\
units of eternity.\
3:00\
Satan incites\
comparison as a tool\
3:03\
to create feelings of\
being superior or inferior,\
3:06\
hiding the eternal truth\
that men's and women's\
3:10\
innate differences are\
God-given and equally valued.\
3:14\
He has attempted to demean\
women's contributions\
3:17\
both to the family\
and in civil society,\
3:20\
thereby decreasing their\
uplifting influence for good.\
3:26\
His goal has been to foster\
a power struggle rather than\
3:29\
a celebration of the unique\
contributions of men and women\
3:32\
that complement one another\
and contribute to unity.\
3:36\
So over the years\
and around the globe,\
3:39\
a full understanding of the\
divinely interdependent and yet\
3:42\
differing contributions and\
responsibilities of women\
3:45\
and men largely disappeared.\
3:48\
Females in many societies\
became subservient\
3:51\
to males rather than\
side-by-side partners,\
3:54\
their activities limited\
to a narrow scope.\
3:56\
Spiritual progress\
slowed to a trickle\
3:59\
during those dark times;\
indeed, little spiritual light\
4:03\
could penetrate minds\
and hearts steeped\
4:05\
in traditions of dominance.\
4:08\
And then the light of\
the restored gospel shone\
4:11\
"above the brightness\
of the sun"\
4:12\
when God the Father and\
His Son, Jesus Christ,\
4:15\
appeared to the boy Joseph Smith\
early in the spring of 1820\
4:19\
in that hallowed woodland\
in upstate New York.\
4:22\
That event began a modern\
outpouring of revelation\
4:25\
from heaven.\
4:26\
One of the first elements\
of Christ's original Church\
4:29\
to be restored was the authority\
of the priesthood of God.\
4:33\
As the Restoration\
continued to unfold,\
4:36\
men and women began\
to realize anew\
4:38\
the importance and potential\
of working as partners,\
4:42\
authorized and directed in\
this sacred labor by Him.\
4:46\
In 1842, when the women\
of the fledgling Church\
4:49\
wanted to form an official\
group to help in the work,\
4:52\
President Joseph Smith felt\
inspired to organize them\
4:55\
"under the priesthood after\
the pattern of the priesthood."\
4:58\
He said, "I now turn the key\
to you in the name of God ...\
5:01\
this is the beginning\
of better days."\
5:04\
And since that key was\
turned, educational,\
5:07\
political, and economic\
opportunities for women\
5:10\
have begun to gradually\
expand throughout the world.\
5:14\
This new Church\
organization for women,\
5:17\
named the Relief Society, was\
unlike other women's societies\
5:21\
of the day because\
it was established\
5:23\
by a prophet who acted\
with priesthood authority\
5:26\
to give women authority,\
sacred responsibilities,\
5:30\
and official positions within\
the structure of the Church,\
5:33\
not apart from it.\
5:35\
From the Prophet Joseph\
Smith's day to ours,\
5:38\
the ongoing Restoration\
of all things\
5:40\
has brought enlightenment on\
the necessity of the authority\
5:44\
and power of the\
priesthood in helping\
5:46\
both men and women\
accomplish their divinely\
5:48\
appointed responsibilities.\
5:50\
Recently we have been taught\
that women who are set apart\
5:54\
under the direction of one\
holding priesthood keys\
5:57\
operate with priesthood\
authority in their callings.\
6:00\
In October 2019, President\
Russell M. Nelson\
6:04\
taught that women who\
are endowed in the temple\
6:06\
have priesthood power in\
their lives and in their homes\
6:10\
as they keep those sacred\
covenants they made with God.\
6:13\
He explained that\
"the heavens are just\
6:16\
as open to women who are\
endowed with God's power flowing\
6:18\
from their priesthood\
covenants as they are to men\
6:21\
who bear the priesthood."\
6:23\
And he encouraged every\
sister to "draw liberally\
6:27\
upon the Savior's power\
to help your family\
6:30\
and others you love."\
6:32\
So what does that\
mean for you and me?\
6:34\
How does understanding\
priesthood authority and power\
6:37\
change our lives?\
6:39\
One of the keys is to understand\
that when women and men work\
6:42\
together, we accomplish\
a great deal more than\
6:45\
we do working separately.\
6:47\
Our roles are complementary\
rather than competitive.\
6:51\
Although women are not ordained\
to a priesthood office,\
6:53\
as noted previously, women are\
blessed with priesthood power\
6:57\
as they keep their\
covenants, and they\
6:59\
operate with\
priesthood authority\
7:01\
when they are set\
apart to a calling.\
7:04\
On a lovely August\
day, I was privileged\
7:07\
to sit down with\
President Russell M.\
7:08\
Nelson in the reconstructed\
home of Joseph\
7:11\
and Emma Smith in\
Harmony, Pennsylvania,\
7:14\
near where the\
Aaronic Priesthood was\
7:16\
restored in these latter days.\
7:18\
In our conversation,\
President Nelson\
7:20\
talked about the\
important role women\
7:23\
played in the Restoration.\
7:27\
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]\
7:27\
One of the most\
important aspects\
7:32\
that I am reminded\
of when I come\
7:34\
to this Restoration\
of the Priesthood site\
7:37\
is the important role that\
women played in the Restoration.\
7:42\
When Joseph first started to\
translate the Book of Mormon,\
7:46\
who did the writing?\
7:47\
Well, he did a\
little, but not much.\
7:50\
Emma stepped in.\
7:53\
And then I think of--Joseph\
went into the woods to pray near\
7:58\
their home in Palmyra, New York.\
8:00\
Where did he go?\
8:02\
He went to the Sacred Grove.\
8:04\
Why did he go there?\
8:05\
Because that's where Mother\
went when she wanted to pray.\
8:09\
Those are just two\
of the women who\
8:11\
had key roles in the\
Restoration of the Priesthood\
8:15\
and in the Restoration\
of the Church.\
8:18\
No doubt we could say our wives\
are just as important today\
8:23\
as they were then.\
8:24\
Of course they are.\
8:25\
[END PLAYBACK]\
8:29\
Like Emma and Lucy\
and Joseph, we\
8:31\
are most effective when we\
are willing to learn from one\
8:34\
another and are\
united in our goal\
8:36\
to become disciples\
of Jesus Christ\
8:38\
and help others along that path.\
8:41\
We are taught that\
"priesthood blesses the lives\
8:43\
of God's children in\
innumerable ways. ...\
8:46\
In [Church] callings,\
temple ordinances,\
8:48\
family relationships, and\
quiet, individual ministry,\
8:52\
Latter-day Saint women\
and men go forward\
8:54\
with priesthood\
power and authority.\
8:57\
[The] interdependence\
of men and women\
8:59\
in accomplishing God's\
work through His power\
9:01\
is central to the gospel\
of Jesus Christ restored\
9:04\
through the Prophet\
Joseph Smith."\
9:07\
Unity is essential\
to the divine work\
9:09\
we are privileged and called to\
do, but it doesn't just happen.\
9:13\
It takes effort and time to\
really counsel together--to\
9:16\
listen to one another,\
understand one\
9:19\
anothers' viewpoints,\
and share experiences,\
9:22\
but the process results in\
more inspired decisions.\
9:25\
Whether at home or in our\
Church responsibilities,\
9:28\
the most effective way to\
fulfill our divine potential\
9:32\
is to work together,\
blessed by the power\
9:34\
and authority of the\
priesthood in our differing yet\
9:37\
complementary roles.\
9:39\
What does that partnership\
look like in the lives\
9:42\
of covenant women today?\
9:43\
Let me share an example.\
9:46\
Alison and John had a\
partnership that was unique.\
9:48\
They rode a tandem bicycle\
in races short and long.\
9:52\
To successfully compete\
on that vehicle,\
9:55\
the two riders\
must be in harmony.\
9:57\
They have to lean in the same\
direction at the right time.\
10:00\
One cannot dominate the other,\
but they must communicate\
10:03\
clearly and each\
do his or her part.\
10:06\
The captain, in front, has\
control over when to brake\
10:10\
and when to stand.\
10:11\
The stoker, in the back,\
needs to pay attention\
10:13\
to what is going on and be ready\
to give extra power if they lag\
10:16\
behind a little or\
ease up if they get\
10:18\
too close to other cyclists.\
10:20\
They must support one another\
to make progress and achieve\
10:23\
their goal.\
10:25\
ALISON EXPLAINED: "For\
the first little while,\
10:27\
the person in the\
captain position\
10:29\
would say, 'Stand' when we\
needed to stand and 'Braking'\
10:32\
when we needed to stop pedaling.\
10:34\
After a while, the\
person who was the stoker\
10:37\
learned to tell when the captain\
was about to stand or brake,\
10:40\
and no words needed to be said.\
10:42\
We learned to be in tune\
to how each other was doing\
10:46\
and could tell when one was\
struggling and [then] the other\
10:48\
tried to pick up the slack.\
10:50\
It's really all about trust\
and working together."\
10:55\
John and Alison\
were united not only\
10:57\
as they pedaled their\
bicycle, but they were united\
10:59\
in their marriage as well.\
11:01\
Each desired the\
happiness of the other\
11:03\
more than his or\
her own; each looked\
11:06\
for the good in one\
another and worked\
11:08\
to overcome the not-so-great\
in him or herself.\
11:11\
They took turns leading and\
took turns giving more when\
11:14\
one partner was struggling.\
11:16\
Each valued the\
other's contributions\
11:18\
and found better answers\
to their challenges\
11:20\
as they combined their\
talents and resources.\
11:23\
They are truly\
bound to one another\
11:25\
through Christlike love.\
11:28\
Becoming more in tune with\
the divine pattern of working\
11:31\
together in unity is critical\
in this day of "me-first"\
11:34\
messages that surround us.\
11:36\
Women do possess distinctive,\
divine gifts and are given\
11:40\
unique responsibilities,\
but those are not more--or\
11:43\
less--important than men's\
gifts and responsibilities.\
11:47\
All are designed and needed to\
bring about Heavenly Father's\
11:50\
divine plan to give\
each of His children\
11:53\
the best opportunity to fulfill\
his or her divine potential.\
11:58\
Today, "we need women who\
have the courage and vision\
12:01\
of our Mother Eve" to\
unite with their brethren\
12:04\
in bringing souls unto Christ.\
12:06\
Men need to become true\
partners rather than\
12:09\
assume they are\
solely responsible\
12:11\
or act as "pretend" partners\
while women carry out\
12:13\
much of the work.\
12:14\
Women need to be willing\
to "step forward [and] take\
12:17\
[their] rightful and needful\
place" as partners rather\
12:20\
than thinking they need\
to do it all by themselves\
12:22\
or wait to be told what to do.\
12:25\
Seeing women as\
vital participants\
12:27\
is not about creating "parity"\
but about understanding\
12:30\
doctrinal truth.\
12:31\
Rather than establishing a\
program to bring that about,\
12:35\
we can actively work to\
value women as God does:\
12:38\
as essential partners\
in the work of salvation\
12:41\
and exaltation.\
12:43\
Are we ready?\
12:44\
Will we strive to\
overcome cultural bias\
12:47\
and instead embrace divine\
patterns and practices\
12:51\
based on foundational doctrine?\
12:53\
President Russell M. Nelson\
invites us to "walk arm in arm\
12:57\
in this sacred work ...\
[to] help prepare the world\
13:00\
for the Second\
Coming of the Lord."\
13:02\
As we do, we will learn to value\
each individual's contributions\
13:06\
and increase the\
effectiveness with which we\
13:09\
fulfill our divine roles.\
13:11\
We will feel greater joy than\
we have ever experienced.\
13:15\
May each of us choose\
to become united\
13:18\
in the Lord's inspired way\
to help His work go forward.\
13:21\
In the name of our beloved\
Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.\
