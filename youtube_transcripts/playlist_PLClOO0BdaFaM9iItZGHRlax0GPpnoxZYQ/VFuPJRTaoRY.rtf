Eighteen years after\
the First Vision,\
0:03\
the Prophet Joseph Smith\
wrote an extensive account\
0:06\
of his experience.\
0:07\
He had faced opposition,\
persecution, harassment,\
0:12\
threats, and brutal attacks.\
0:13\
Yet he continued to boldly\
testify of his First Vision.\
0:18\
"I had actually seen a light,\
and in the midst of that light\
0:23\
I saw two Personages, and they\
did in reality speak to me;\
0:28\
and though I was hated and\
persecuted for saying that I\
0:32\
had seen a vision,\
yet it was true; ...\
0:35\
I knew it, and I knew\
that God knew it,\
0:39\
and I could not deny it."\
0:42\
In his difficult\
hours, Joseph's memory\
0:46\
reached back nearly two\
decades to the certainty\
0:49\
of God's love for\
him and the events\
0:52\
that welcomed in the\
long-foretold restoration.\
0:55\
Reflecting on his\
spiritual journey,\
0:58\
Joseph said: "I\
don't blame any one\
1:02\
for not believing my history.\
1:04\
If I had not\
experienced what I have,\
1:07\
I would not have\
believed it myself."\
1:10\
But the experiences were real,\
and he never forgot or denied\
1:15\
them, quietly\
confirming his testimony\
1:19\
as he moved to Carthage.\
1:21\
"I am going like a lamb to\
the slaughter," he said,\
1:25\
"but I am calm as a\
summer's morning; I\
1:29\
have a conscience void\
of offense towards God,\
1:32\
and towards all men."\
1:36\
There is a lesson for us in\
the Prophet Joseph's example.\
1:40\
Along with the\
peaceful direction\
1:43\
we receive from the Holy\
Ghost, from time to time\
1:47\
God powerfully and\
very personally\
1:51\
assures each of us that\
He knows us and loves us\
1:55\
and that He is blessing us\
specifically and openly.\
1:59\
Then, in our moments\
of difficulty,\
2:02\
the Savior brings these\
experiences back into our mind.\
2:08\
Think of your own life.\
2:10\
Over the years, I have\
listened to thousands\
2:14\
of profoundly\
spiritual experiences\
2:16\
from Latter-day Saints\
all across the world,\
2:19\
confirming to me beyond\
any question that God knows\
2:24\
and loves each of us and\
that He eagerly desires\
2:27\
to reveal Himself to us.\
2:31\
These experiences may come\
at pivotal times in our lives\
2:35\
or in what may at first seem\
as uneventful happenings,\
2:39\
but they are always accompanied\
by an exceptionally strong\
2:44\
spiritual confirmation\
of the love of God.\
2:50\
Remembering these spiritually\
defining experiences\
2:53\
takes us to our knees,\
declaring as did\
2:56\
the Prophet Joseph: "What\
I received was from heaven.\
3:01\
I know it, and I know that\
God knows that I know it."\
3:08\
Reflect on your own\
spiritually defining memories\
3:11\
as I share a few\
examples from others.\
3:15\
Years ago, an elderly\
stake patriarch\
3:18\
with two failing heart valves\
pleaded for then-Dr. Russell M.\
3:23\
Nelson to intervene,\
although at that time\
3:26\
there was not a surgical\
solution for the damaged\
3:30\
second valve.\
3:31\
Dr. Nelson finally\
agreed to do the surgery.\
3:35\
Here are President\
Nelson's words:\
3:39\
"After relieving the\
obstruction of the first valve,\
3:43\
we exposed the second valve.\
3:45\
We found it to be intact\
but so badly dilated\
3:49\
that it could no longer\
function as it should.\
3:52\
While examining this\
valve, a message\
3:56\
was distinctly\
impressed upon my mind:\
3:59\
Reduce the circumference\
of the ring.\
4:02\
I announced that\
message to my assistant.\
4:06\
'The valve tissue will\
be sufficient if we can\
4:09\
effectively reduce the ring\
toward its normal size.'\
4:14\
"But how? ...\
4:16\
A picture came\
vividly to my mind,\
4:19\
showing how stitches could be\
placed--to make a pleat here\
4:23\
and a tuck there.\
4:24\
...\
4:25\
I still remember that mental\
image--complete with dotted\
4:29\
lines where sutures\
should be placed.\
4:32\
The repair was completed\
as diagrammed in my mind.\
4:36\
We tested the valve\
and found the leak\
4:39\
to be reduced remarkably.\
4:42\
My assistant said, 'It's a\
miracle.'" The patriarch lived\
4:48\
for many years.\
4:51\
Dr. Nelson had been directed.\
4:54\
And he knew that God knew that\
he knew he had been directed.\
5:01\
Kathy and I first met Beatrice\
Magre in France 30 years ago.\
5:06\
Beatrice recently told\
me of an experience\
5:09\
that impacted her spiritual\
life shortly after her baptism\
5:13\
as a teenager.\
5:15\
Here are her words:\
5:18\
"The youth of our branch had\
traveled with their leaders\
5:21\
to Lacanau Beach, an hour\
and a half from Bordeaux.\
5:25\
"Before returning home,\
one of the leaders\
5:28\
decided to take a last swim\
and dove into the waves\
5:32\
with his glasses.\
5:33\
When he resurfaced, his\
glasses had disappeared. ...\
5:37\
They were lost in the ocean.\
5:41\
"The loss of his glasses\
would prevent him\
5:44\
from driving his car.\
5:46\
We would be stranded\
far from home.\
5:50\
"A sister filled with faith\
suggested that we pray.\
5:55\
"I murmured that praying would\
avail us absolutely nothing,\
5:59\
and I uneasily joined the\
group to pray publicly\
6:03\
as we stood waist-deep\
in the murky water.\
6:08\
"Once the prayer was\
over, I stretched my arms\
6:12\
to splash everyone.\
6:14\
As I was sweeping the ocean's\
surface, his pair of glasses\
6:20\
rested in my hand.\
6:23\
A powerful feeling\
pierced my soul\
6:26\
that God does actually hear\
and answer our prayers."\
6:32\
Forty-five years\
later, she recalled it\
6:35\
as if had happened yesterday.\
6:38\
Beatrice had been\
blessed, and she\
6:41\
knew that God knew that she\
knew that she had been blessed.\
6:48\
The experiences of President\
Nelson and Sister Magre\
6:51\
were very different,\
yet for both,\
6:55\
an unforgettable spiritually\
defining memory of God's love\
7:00\
was embedded in their hearts.\
7:04\
These defining events\
often come in learning\
7:07\
about the restored gospel or in\
sharing the gospel with others.\
7:12\
This picture was taken in\
Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 2004.\
7:18\
Floripes Luzia Damasio of\
the Ipatinga Brazil Stake\
7:23\
was 114 years old.\
7:28\
Speaking of her\
conversion, Sister Damasio\
7:32\
told me that missionaries\
in her village\
7:35\
had given a priesthood blessing\
to a critically ill baby who\
7:39\
miraculously recovered.\
7:41\
She wanted to know more.\
7:44\
As she prayed about\
their message,\
7:47\
an undeniable\
witness of the Spirit\
7:50\
confirmed to her that Joseph\
Smith was a prophet of God.\
7:56\
At 103 she was baptized,\
and at 104 she was endowed.\
8:04\
Every year after, she\
made the 14-hour bus ride\
8:08\
to spend a week in the temple.\
8:10\
Sister Damasio had received\
a heavenly confirmation,\
8:15\
and she knew that\
God knew that she\
8:19\
knew that the witness was true.\
8:23\
Here is a spiritual memory\
from my first mission to France\
8:26\
48 years ago.\
8:28\
While tracting, my companion\
and I left a Book of Mormon\
8:32\
with an elderly woman.\
8:34\
Returning to the woman's\
apartment about a week later,\
8:37\
she opened the door.\
8:38\
Before any words\
were spoken, I felt\
8:43\
a tangible, spiritual power.\
8:46\
The intense feelings continued\
as Madame Alice Audubert\
8:51\
invited us in and told us she\
had read the Book of Mormon\
8:55\
and knew that it was true.\
8:58\
As we left her apartment\
that day, I prayed,\
9:03\
"Heavenly Father, please\
help me to never forget\
9:08\
what I have just felt."\
9:10\
I never have.\
9:14\
In a seemingly ordinary\
moment, at a door much\
9:18\
like hundreds of other doors,\
I had felt the power of heaven.\
9:23\
And I knew that God knew that\
I knew that a window of heaven\
9:32\
had been opened.\
9:35\
These spiritually defining\
moments come at different times\
9:37\
and in different ways,\
individualized for each of us.\
9:42\
Think of your favorite\
examples in the scriptures.\
9:45\
Those listening to the\
Apostle Peter "were pricked\
9:49\
in their heart[s]."\
9:51\
The Lamanite woman Abish\
believed the "remarkable vision\
9:56\
of her father."\
9:58\
And a voice came into\
the mind of Enos.\
10:03\
My friend Clayton Christensen\
described an experience during\
10:08\
a very prayerful reading of\
the Book of Mormon this way:\
10:12\
"A beautiful, warm,\
loving spirit ...\
10:16\
surrounded me and\
permeated my soul,\
10:19\
enveloping me in a feeling of\
love that I had not imagined I\
10:24\
could feel, [and these feelings\
continued night after night]."\
10:33\
There are times when\
spiritual feelings go down\
10:35\
into our heart like fire,\
illuminating our soul.\
10:40\
Joseph Smith explained\
that we sometimes\
10:42\
receive "sudden\
strokes of ideas"\
10:45\
and occasionally the pure\
flow of intelligence.\
10:51\
President Dallin H. Oaks, in\
responding to a sincere man who\
10:57\
claimed never to have had\
such an experience, counseled,\
11:01\
"Perhaps your prayers have\
been answered again and again,\
11:06\
but you have had your\
expectations fixed on a sign\
11:10\
so grand or a voice\
so loud that you\
11:14\
think you have had no answer."\
11:18\
The Savior Himself\
spoke of a people\
11:21\
with great faith who\
"were [blessed] with fire\
11:25\
and with the Holy Ghost,\
[but who] knew it not."\
11:30\
We have recently heard\
President Russell M. Nelson say:\
11:34\
"I invite you to\
think deeply and often\
11:37\
about this key question:\
How do you hear Him?\
11:42\
I also invite you to\
take steps to hear\
11:45\
Him better and more often."\
11:48\
He repeated that\
invitation this morning.\
11:52\
We hear Him in our prayers, in\
our homes, in the scriptures,\
11:57\
in our hymns as we worthily\
partake of the sacrament,\
12:02\
as we declare our faith,\
as we serve others,\
12:06\
and as we attend the temple\
with fellow believers.\
12:11\
Spiritually defining\
moments come\
12:14\
as we prayerfully listen\
to general conference\
12:17\
and as we better keep\
the commandments.\
12:20\
And children, these experiences\
are for you as well.\
12:25\
Remember, Jesus "did teach and\
minister unto the children ...\
12:30\
and [the children] did speak\
... great and marvelous things."\
12:34\
The Lord said:\
12:38\
"[This knowledge is] given\
by my Spirit unto you, ...\
12:42\
and save it were by my power\
you could not have [it];\
12:46\
"Wherefore, you can testify\
that you have heard my voice,\
12:50\
and know my words."\
12:54\
We can "hear Him" because of\
the blessing of the Savior's\
12:58\
incomparable Atonement.\
13:02\
While we cannot choose the\
timing of receiving these\
13:04\
defining moments,\
President Henry B.\
13:08\
Eyring gave this counsel in\
our preparation: "Tonight,\
13:13\
and tomorrow night, you\
might pray and ponder,\
13:17\
asking the questions: Did God\
send a message that was just\
13:22\
for me?\
13:24\
Did I see His hand in my life\
or the lives of my [family]?"\
13:31\
Faith, obedience,\
humility, and real intent\
13:37\
open the windows of heaven.\
13:42\
You might think of your\
spiritual memories this way.\
13:45\
With constant prayer,\
a determination\
13:48\
to keep our covenants, and\
the gift of the Holy Ghost,\
13:52\
we navigate our\
way through life.\
13:55\
When personal difficulty,\
doubt, or discouragement\
13:59\
darken our path or when world\
conditions beyond our control\
14:04\
lead us to wonder\
about the future,\
14:08\
the spiritually defining\
memories from our book of life\
14:12\
are like luminous stones that\
help brighten the road ahead,\
14:16\
assuring us that God knows\
us, loves us, and has\
14:21\
sent His Son, Jesus Christ,\
to help us return home.\
14:26\
And when someone sets his or\
her defining memories aside\
14:31\
and is lost or confused, we\
turn them toward the Savior\
14:36\
as we share our faith\
and memories with them,\
14:40\
helping them rediscover those\
precious spiritual moments they\
14:45\
once treasured.\
14:48\
Some experiences are\
so sacred that we\
14:51\
guard them in our spiritual\
memory and do not share them.\
14:56\
"Angels speak by the\
power of the Holy Ghost;\
14:59\
wherefore, they speak\
the words of Christ."\
15:03\
"Angels [have not]\
ceased to minister unto\
15:05\
the children of men.\
15:07\
"For behold, they are\
subject unto [Christ],\
15:10\
to minister according\
to ... his command,\
15:12\
showing themselves unto them\
of strong faith and a firm mind\
15:17\
in every form of godliness."\
15:20\
And "the Comforter, which\
is the Holy Ghost, ...\
15:23\
shall teach you all things,\
and bring all things\
15:28\
to your remembrance."\
15:32\
Embrace your sacred memories.\
15:33\
Believe them.\
15:35\
Write them down.\
15:36\
Share them with your family.\
15:39\
Trust that they come to\
you from your Heavenly\
15:42\
Father and His Beloved Son.\
15:45\
Let them bring\
patience to your doubts\
15:48\
and understanding to\
your difficulties.\
15:51\
I promise you that as\
you willingly acknowledge\
15:56\
and carefully treasure\
the spiritually defining\
15:59\
events in your life, more\
and more will come to you.\
16:05\
Heavenly Father knows\
you and loves you!\
16:10\
Jesus is the Christ, His\
gospel has been restored,\
16:15\
and as we remain\
faithful, I witness\
16:20\
we will be His forever, in the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
