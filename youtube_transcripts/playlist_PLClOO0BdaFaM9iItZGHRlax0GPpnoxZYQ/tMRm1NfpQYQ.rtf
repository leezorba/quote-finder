My dear brothers and\
sisters, how thankful\
0:04\
I am that, through\
the use of technology,\
0:07\
we have been able\
to meet together\
0:10\
and worship on this\
Sunday morning.\
0:13\
How blessed we are to know\
that the gospel of Jesus Christ\
0:17\
has been restored to the earth!\
0:20\
In the past several\
weeks, most of us\
0:22\
have experienced disruptions\
in our personal lives.\
0:26\
Earthquakes, fires, floods,\
plagues, and their aftermaths\
0:33\
have disrupted routines\
and caused shortages\
0:36\
of food, staples, and savings.\
0:42\
Amidst all of this,\
we commend you\
0:44\
and thank you for choosing\
to hear the word of the Lord\
0:47\
during this time of\
turmoil by joining\
0:51\
with us for general conference.\
0:54\
The increasing darkness\
that accompanies\
0:57\
tribulation makes the\
light of Jesus Christ\
1:01\
shine ever brighter.\
1:04\
Just think of the\
good each of us\
1:07\
can do during this time\
of global upheaval.\
1:10\
Your love of and\
faith in the Savior\
1:14\
may very well be the\
catalyst for someone\
1:17\
to discover the\
Restoration of the fulness\
1:21\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
1:26\
In the past two years,\
Sister Nelson and I\
1:28\
have met with thousands\
of you around the world.\
1:31\
We have convened with\
you in outdoor arenas\
1:34\
and in hotel ballrooms.\
1:36\
In each location,\
I have felt that I\
1:39\
was in the presence\
of the Lord's elect\
1:42\
and that I was seeing\
the gathering of Israel\
1:45\
occur before my eyes.\
1:49\
We live in the day that "our\
forefathers have awaited\
1:52\
with anxious expectation."\
1:54\
We have front-row\
seats to witness\
1:58\
live what the prophet\
Nephi saw only\
2:02\
in vision, that "the\
power of the Lamb of God"\
2:06\
would descend "upon the\
covenant people of the Lord,\
2:10\
who were scattered upon\
all the face of the earth;\
2:14\
and they were armed\
with righteousness\
2:17\
and with the power of\
God in great glory."\
2:24\
You, my brothers and sisters,\
are among those men, women,\
2:27\
and children whom Nephi saw.\
2:29\
Think of that!\
2:33\
Regardless of where you live\
or what your circumstances are,\
2:36\
the Lord Jesus Christ\
is your Savior,\
2:40\
and God's prophet Joseph\
Smith is your prophet.\
2:45\
He was foreordained before\
the foundation of the earth\
2:49\
to be the prophet of\
this last dispensation,\
2:53\
when "nothing shall be\
withheld" from the Saints.\
2:58\
Revelation continues\
to flow from the Lord\
3:02\
during this ongoing\
process of Restoration.\
3:08\
What does it mean for you that\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
3:12\
has been restored to the earth?\
3:16\
It means that you\
and your family\
3:18\
can be sealed together forever!\
3:21\
It means that because\
you have been baptized\
3:25\
by one who has authority\
from Jesus Christ\
3:28\
and have been confirmed\
a member of His Church,\
3:31\
you can enjoy the\
constant companionship\
3:34\
of the Holy Ghost.\
3:36\
He will guide and protect you.\
3:39\
It means you will never be left\
comfortless or without access\
3:45\
to the power of God to help you.\
3:49\
It means that priesthood\
power can bless you\
3:53\
as you receive\
essential ordinances\
3:56\
and make covenants\
with God and keep them.\
4:01\
What an anchor to our\
souls are these truths,\
4:05\
especially during these times\
when the tempest is raging.\
4:12\
The Book of Mormon chronicles\
the classic rise and fall\
4:16\
of two major civilizations.\
4:19\
Their history\
demonstrates how easy\
4:22\
it is for a majority\
of the people\
4:24\
to forget God, reject warnings\
of the Lord's prophets,\
4:30\
and seek power, popularity,\
and pleasures of the flesh.\
4:36\
Repeatedly, past prophets have\
declared "great and marvelous\
4:41\
things unto the people,\
which they did not believe."\
4:48\
It is no different in our day.\
4:50\
Through the years, great\
and marvelous things\
4:55\
have been heard from dedicated\
pulpits across the earth.\
4:59\
Yet most people do not\
embrace these truths--either\
5:03\
because they do not know\
where to look for them,\
5:07\
or because they are listening to\
those who do not have the whole\
5:10\
truth, or because they have\
rejected truth in favor\
5:16\
of worldly pursuits.\
5:20\
The adversary is clever.\
5:22\
For millennia he has been\
making good look evil and evil\
5:28\
look good.\
5:30\
His messages tend to be\
loud, bold, and boastful.\
5:37\
However, messages from\
our Heavenly Father\
5:40\
are strikingly different.\
5:42\
He communicates simply,\
quietly, and with such stunning\
5:48\
plainness that we cannot\
misunderstand Him.\
5:54\
For example, whenever He has\
introduced His Only Begotten\
5:58\
Son to mortals\
upon the earth, He\
6:01\
has done so with\
remarkably few words.\
6:07\
On the Mount of Transfiguration\
to Peter, James, and John,\
6:13\
God said, "This is my\
beloved Son: hear him."\
6:20\
His words to the Nephites in\
ancient Bountiful were "Behold\
6:25\
my Beloved Son, in\
whom I am well pleased,\
6:30\
in whom I have glorified\
my name--hear ye him."\
6:37\
And to Joseph Smith, in that\
profound declaration that\
6:41\
opened this\
dispensation, God simply\
6:43\
said, "This is My Beloved Son.\
6:48\
Hear Him!"\
6:53\
Now, my dear\
brothers and sisters,\
6:55\
consider the fact that in these\
three instances just mentioned,\
7:00\
just before the Father\
introduced the Son,\
7:04\
the people involved\
were in a state of fear\
7:08\
and, to some\
degree, desperation.\
7:14\
The Apostles were\
afraid when they\
7:16\
saw Jesus Christ\
encircled by a cloud\
7:18\
on the Mount of Transfiguration.\
7:22\
The Nephites were\
afraid because they\
7:25\
had been through destruction\
and darkness for several days.\
7:32\
Joseph Smith was in the\
grips of a force of darkness\
7:35\
just before the heavens opened.\
7:40\
Our Father knows that\
when we are surrounded\
7:42\
by uncertainty and fear, what\
will help us the very most\
7:49\
is to hear His Son.\
7:55\
Because when we seek to\
hear--truly hear--His Son,\
8:00\
we will be guided to know what\
to do in any circumstance.\
8:07\
The very first word in\
the Doctrine and Covenants\
8:09\
is hearken.\
8:11\
It means "to listen with\
the intent to obey."\
8:16\
To hearken means to "hear\
Him"--to hear what the Savior\
8:22\
says and then to\
heed His counsel.\
8:25\
In those two words--"Hear\
Him"--God gives us the pattern\
8:31\
for success, happiness,\
and joy in this life.\
8:38\
We are to hear the words of\
the Lord, hearken to them,\
8:42\
and heed what He has told us!\
8:46\
As disciples of Jesus Christ,\
our efforts to hear Him\
8:51\
need to be ever\
more intentional.\
8:55\
It takes conscious\
and consistent effort\
8:59\
to fill our daily\
lives with His words,\
9:02\
His teachings, His truths.\
9:07\
We simply cannot rely\
upon information we bump\
9:10\
into on social media.\
9:12\
With billions of\
words online and\
9:17\
in a marketing-saturated\
world constantly infiltrated\
9:21\
by noisy, nefarious\
efforts of the adversary,\
9:26\
where can we go to hear Him?\
9:30\
We can go to the scriptures.\
9:31\
They teach us about Jesus\
Christ and His gospel,\
9:35\
the magnitude of His Atonement,\
and our Father's great plan\
9:41\
of happiness and redemption.\
9:44\
Daily immersion\
in the word of God\
9:47\
is crucial for\
spiritual survival,\
9:49\
especially in these days\
of increasing upheaval.\
9:56\
As we feast on the\
words of Christ daily,\
10:00\
the words of Christ\
will tell us how\
10:02\
to respond to difficulties we\
never thought we would face.\
10:10\
We can also hear\
Him in the temple.\
10:14\
The house of the Lord\
is a house of learning.\
10:18\
There the Lord teaches\
in His own way.\
10:22\
There each ordinance\
teaches about the Savior.\
10:27\
There we learn how\
to part the veil\
10:31\
and communicate more\
clearly with heaven.\
10:34\
There we learn how to\
rebuke the adversary\
10:39\
and draw upon the Lord's\
priesthood power to strengthen\
10:42\
us and those we love.\
10:46\
How eager each of us should\
be to seek refuge there.\
10:54\
When these temporary COVID-19\
restrictions are lifted,\
10:59\
please schedule\
regular time to worship\
11:02\
and serve in the temple.\
11:04\
Every minute of that\
time will bless you\
11:07\
and your family in\
ways nothing else can.\
11:12\
Take time to ponder\
what you hear\
11:15\
and feel when you are there.\
11:19\
Ask the Lord to\
teach you how to open\
11:22\
the heavens to bless your\
life and the life of those\
11:26\
you love and serve.\
11:31\
While worshipping in the temple\
is presently not possible,\
11:34\
I invite you to increase\
your participation\
11:37\
in family history,\
including family history\
11:40\
research and indexing.\
11:43\
I promise that as you increase\
your time in temple and family\
11:47\
history work, you will\
increase and improve\
11:51\
your ability to hear Him.\
11:56\
We also hear Him more clearly\
as we refine our ability\
12:00\
to recognize the whisperings\
of the Holy Ghost.\
12:04\
It has never been more\
imperative to know\
12:07\
how the Spirit speaks\
to you than right now.\
12:13\
In the Godhead, the Holy\
Ghost is the messenger.\
12:17\
He will bring\
thoughts to your mind\
12:20\
which the Father and the\
Son want you to receive.\
12:25\
He is the Comforter.\
12:28\
He will bring a feeling\
of peace to your heart.\
12:31\
He testifies of truth\
and will confirm\
12:34\
what is true as you hear and\
read the word of the Lord.\
12:42\
I renew my plea for\
you to do whatever\
12:44\
it takes to increase your\
spiritual capacity to receive\
12:48\
personal revelation.\
12:51\
Doing so will help you\
to know how to move ahead\
12:54\
with your life, what to\
do during times of crisis,\
12:59\
and how to discern and avoid the\
temptations and the deceptions\
13:05\
of the adversary.\
13:09\
And, finally, we hear Him as\
we heed the words of prophets,\
13:14\
seers, and revelators.\
13:17\
Ordained Apostles of Jesus\
Christ always testify of Him.\
13:24\
They point the way\
as we make our way\
13:28\
through the heart-wrenching\
maze of our mortal experiences.\
13:38\
What will happen as you\
more intentionally hear,\
13:41\
hearken, and heed what\
the Savior has said\
13:45\
and what He is saying\
now through His prophets?\
13:48\
I promise you that you will be\
blessed with additional power\
13:54\
to deal with temptation,\
struggles, and weakness.\
13:59\
I promise miracles in your\
marriage, family relationships,\
14:04\
and daily work.\
14:05\
And I promise that your\
capacity to feel joy\
14:09\
will increase even if turbulence\
increases in your life.\
14:18\
This April 2020\
general conference\
14:20\
is our time to commemorate an\
event that changed the world.\
14:25\
As we anticipated this 200th\
anniversary of Joseph Smith's\
14:30\
First Vision, the First\
Presidency and Council\
14:34\
of the Twelve\
Apostles wondered what\
14:37\
we might do to commemorate\
appropriately this singular\
14:40\
event.\
14:43\
That theophany initiated\
the Restoration\
14:46\
of the fulness of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ\
14:49\
and ushered in the dispensation\
of the fulness of times.\
14:57\
We wondered if a monument\
should be erected.\
15:00\
But as we considered the unique\
historic and international\
15:05\
impact of that First Vision,\
we felt impressed to create\
15:11\
a monument--not of\
granite or stone,\
15:15\
but of words--words of solemn\
and sacred proclamation,\
15:23\
written not to be carved\
in "tables of stone,"\
15:28\
but rather to be etched in the\
"fleshy tables" of our hearts.\
15:35\
Since the Church was organized,\
only five proclamations\
15:38\
have been issued,\
with the last being\
15:41\
"The Family: A\
Proclamation to the World,"\
15:44\
presented by President\
Gordon B. Hinckley in 1995.\
15:51\
Now as we contemplate this\
significant time in the history\
15:54\
of the world, and\
the Lord's charge\
15:57\
to gather scattered\
Israel in preparation\
16:00\
for the Second Coming of\
Jesus Christ, we, the First\
16:04\
Presidency and Council\
of the Twelve Apostles,\
16:07\
issue the following\
proclamation.\
16:10\
Its title is "The\
Restoration of the Fulness\
16:15\
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ:\
A Bicentennial Proclamation\
16:20\
to the World."\
16:22\
It is authored by the First\
Presidency and the Council\
16:26\
of the Twelve Apostles\
of The Church of Jesus\
16:29\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
16:31\
It is dated April 2020.\
16:34\
To prepare for\
today, I previously\
16:41\
recorded this proclamation\
in the Sacred Grove,\
16:45\
where Joseph Smith first\
saw the Father and the Son.\
17:06\
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]\
17:19\
"We solemnly proclaim that\
God loves His children\
17:24\
in every nation of the world.\
17:26\
God the Father has given\
us the divine birth,\
17:30\
the incomparable life,\
and the infinite atoning\
17:33\
sacrifice of His Beloved\
Son, Jesus Christ.\
17:38\
By the power of\
the Father, Jesus\
17:43\
rose again and gained\
the victory over death.\
17:48\
He is our Savior, our\
Exemplar, and our Redeemer.\
17:56\
"Two hundred years ago, on\
a beautiful spring morning\
18:00\
in 1820, young\
Joseph Smith, seeking\
18:05\
to know which church to\
join, went into the woods\
18:07\
to pray near his home in\
upstate New York, USA.\
18:13\
He had questions regarding\
the salvation of his soul\
18:17\
and trusted that God\
would direct him.\
18:22\
"In humility, we declare\
that in answer to his prayer,\
18:26\
God the Father and\
His Son, Jesus Christ,\
18:29\
appeared to Joseph\
and inaugurated\
18:33\
the 'restitution of all things'\
as foretold in the Bible.\
18:38\
In this vision, he\
learned that following\
18:43\
the death of the\
original Apostles,\
18:46\
Christ's New Testament Church\
was lost from the earth.\
18:51\
Joseph would be\
instrumental in its return.\
18:56\
"We affirm that\
under the direction\
18:58\
of the Father and the\
Son, heavenly messengers\
19:02\
came to instruct\
Joseph and re-establish\
19:05\
the Church of Jesus Christ.\
19:08\
The resurrected John the\
Baptist restored the authority\
19:12\
to baptize by immersion\
for the remission of sins.\
19:16\
Three of the original twelve\
Apostles--Peter, James,\
19:21\
and John--restored the\
apostleship and keys\
19:25\
of priesthood authority.\
19:27\
Others came as well,\
including Elijah,\
19:30\
who restored the authority to\
join families together forever\
19:35\
in eternal relationships\
that transcend death.\
19:42\
"We further witness that\
Joseph Smith was given the gift\
19:46\
and power of God to\
translate an ancient record:\
19:51\
the Book of Mormon--Another\
Testament of Jesus Christ.\
19:58\
Pages of this sacred\
text include an account\
20:02\
of the personal ministry of\
Jesus Christ among people\
20:06\
in the Western Hemisphere\
soon after His Resurrection.\
20:11\
It teaches of life's\
purpose and explains\
20:15\
the doctrine of Christ, which\
is central to that purpose.\
20:21\
As a companion scripture to\
the Bible, the Book of Mormon\
20:26\
testifies that all human\
beings are sons and daughters\
20:30\
of a loving Father\
in Heaven, that He\
20:33\
has a divine plan for our lives,\
and that His Son, Jesus Christ,\
20:38\
speaks today as well\
as in days of old.\
20:43\
"We declare that The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
20:47\
Saints, organized\
on April 6, 1830,\
20:51\
is Christ's New Testament\
Church restored.\
20:57\
This Church is anchored\
in the perfect life\
21:01\
of its chief cornerstone,\
Jesus Christ,\
21:06\
and in His infinite Atonement\
and literal Resurrection.\
21:12\
Jesus Christ has once\
again called Apostles\
21:16\
and has given them\
priesthood authority.\
21:19\
He invites all of us to come\
unto Him and His Church,\
21:24\
to receive the Holy Ghost,\
the ordinances of salvation,\
21:29\
and to gain enduring joy.\
21:35\
"Two hundred years have now\
elapsed since this Restoration\
21:39\
was initiated by God the Father\
and His Beloved Son, Jesus\
21:42\
Christ.\
21:43\
Millions throughout the world\
have embraced a knowledge\
21:48\
of these prophesied events.\
21:52\
"We gladly declare that\
the promised Restoration\
21:57\
goes forward through\
continuing revelation.\
22:00\
The earth will never\
again be the same,\
22:04\
as God will 'gather together\
in one all things in Christ.'\
22:12\
"With reverence and gratitude,\
we as His Apostles invite all\
22:18\
to know--as we do--that\
the heavens are open.\
22:23\
We affirm that God\
is making known\
22:28\
His will for His beloved\
sons and daughters.\
22:31\
We testify that\
those who prayerfully\
22:35\
study the message of the\
Restoration and act in faith\
22:40\
will be blessed to gain their\
own witness of its divinity\
22:45\
and of its purpose to prepare\
the world for the promised\
22:49\
Second Coming of our Lord\
and Savior, Jesus Christ."\
22:53\
[END PLAYBACK]\
22:58\
Beloved brothers\
and sisters, that\
23:00\
is our bicentennial proclamation\
to the world regarding\
23:03\
the Restoration of the gospel\
of Jesus Christ in its fulness.\
23:07\
It has been translated\
into 12 languages.\
23:11\
Other languages\
will soon follow.\
23:14\
It will be available\
immediately on the Church\
23:18\
website, from which\
you may obtain a copy.\
23:21\
Study it privately and with\
your family members and friends.\
23:26\
Ponder the truths and think of\
the impact those truths will\
23:30\
have on your life if you will\
hear them, hearken to them,\
23:35\
and heed the commandments and\
covenants that accompany them.\
23:39\
I know that Joseph Smith is\
the foreordained prophet whom\
23:43\
the Lord chose to open\
this last dispensation.\
23:46\
Through him the Lord's Church\
was restored to the earth.\
23:49\
Joseph sealed his\
testimony with his blood.\
23:53\
How I love and honor him!\
23:57\
God lives!\
23:57\
Jesus is the Christ!\
23:59\
His Church has been restored!\
24:01\
He and His Father, our Heavenly\
Father, are watching over us.\
24:05\
I so testify in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
