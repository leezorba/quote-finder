Throughout this\
general conference\
0:03\
we have spoken and sung with\
joy about the fulfillment\
0:08\
of the long-ago prophesied\
"restitution of all things,"\
0:11\
about "bringing together in\
one all things in Christ,"\
0:15\
about the return of the fulness\
of the gospel, priesthood,\
0:20\
and Church of Jesus Christ\
to the earth, all of which\
0:24\
we capture in the title\
"the Restoration."\
0:28\
But the Restoration is\
not only for those of us\
0:30\
who rejoice in it today.\
0:32\
The revelations of\
the First Vision\
0:35\
were not for Joseph\
Smith alone but are\
0:38\
offered as light and truth\
for any who "lack wisdom."\
0:42\
The Book of Mormon is the\
possession of mankind.\
0:45\
The priesthood ordinances\
of salvation and exaltation\
0:49\
were prepared for\
every individual,\
0:52\
including those who no\
longer dwell in mortality.\
0:56\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints\
0:59\
and its blessings are intended\
for all who want them.\
1:04\
The gift of the Holy Ghost\
is meant for everyone.\
1:07\
The Restoration\
belongs to the world,\
1:11\
and its message is\
especially urgent today:\
1:15\
"Wherefore, how\
great the importance\
1:17\
to make these things known unto\
the inhabitants of the earth,\
1:20\
that they may know that there\
is no flesh that can dwell\
1:23\
in the presence\
of God, save it be\
1:26\
through the merits,\
and mercy, and grace\
1:28\
of the Holy Messiah, who\
layeth down his life according\
1:32\
to the flesh, and\
taketh it again\
1:35\
by the power of\
the Spirit, that he\
1:37\
may bring to pass the\
resurrection of the dead."\
1:41\
From the day that the\
Prophet's brother Samuel\
1:44\
Smith filled his satchel\
with freshly printed\
1:47\
copies of the Book\
of Mormon and set out\
1:50\
on foot to share\
the new scripture,\
1:52\
the Saints have\
labored without ceasing\
1:55\
to "make these things known unto\
the inhabitants of the earth."\
2:00\
In 1920, then-Elder\
David O. McKay\
2:03\
of the Quorum of\
the Twelve Apostles\
2:05\
began a yearlong tour of\
the missions of the Church.\
2:09\
By May 1921, he was standing in\
a small cemetery in Fagali'i,\
2:15\
Samoa, before the\
well-tended graves\
2:19\
of three small children, the\
daughter and two sons of Thomas\
2:23\
and Sarah Hilton.\
2:25\
These little ones--the oldest\
was two--died during the time\
2:30\
Thomas and Sarah served as\
a young missionary couple\
2:34\
in the late 1800s.\
2:36\
Before he left Utah, Elder McKay\
promised Sarah, now a widow,\
2:41\
that he would visit her\
children's graves in Samoa,\
2:45\
as she had never been\
able to return there.\
2:48\
Elder McKay wrote back to\
her, "Your three little ones,\
2:52\
Sister Hilton, in\
silence most eloquent ...\
2:56\
carry on your noble missionary\
work begun nearly 30 years\
3:00\
ago."\
3:01\
Then he added a verse\
of his own composition:\
3:06\
"By loving hands their\
dying eyes were closed,\
3:10\
By loving hands their\
little limbs composed,\
3:15\
By foreign hands their\
humble graves adorned,\
3:18\
By strangers honor'd, and\
by strangers mourned."\
3:24\
This story is but one\
of thousands, hundreds\
3:26\
of thousands, that speak\
of the time, treasure,\
3:30\
and lives sacrificed\
over the last 200 years\
3:35\
to share the message\
of the Restoration.\
3:38\
Our aspiration to reach every\
nation, kindred, tongue,\
3:41\
and people is\
undiminished today,\
3:44\
as witnessed by the\
tens of thousands\
3:47\
of young men, women, and\
couples currently serving\
3:50\
under full-time mission\
calls; by Church members who,\
3:54\
generally, echo Philip's\
invitation to come and see;\
3:59\
and by the millions of dollars\
spent annually to sustain\
4:03\
that effort across the world.\
4:06\
While our invitations\
are without compulsion,\
4:09\
we hope people will\
find them compelling.\
4:11\
For that to be so, I believe\
at least three things\
4:14\
are required: first, your\
love; second, your example;\
4:19\
and third, your use\
of the Book of Mormon.\
4:23\
Our invitations cannot be\
a matter of self-interest;\
4:26\
rather, they must be an\
expression of selfless love.\
4:30\
This love, known as charity,\
the pure love of Christ,\
4:33\
is ours for the asking.\
4:35\
We are invited, even commanded,\
to "pray unto the Father\
4:39\
with all the energy\
of heart, that [we]\
4:41\
may be filled with this love."\
4:45\
As an example, I\
share an experience\
4:47\
related by Sister\
Lanett Ho Ching,\
4:49\
currently serving with her\
husband, President Francis Ho\
4:53\
Ching, who presides over\
the Samoa Apia Mission.\
4:57\
Sister Ho Ching relates:\
5:00\
"Years ago, our young\
family moved to a tiny home\
5:03\
in Laie, Hawaii.\
5:05\
The carport of our\
home had been converted\
5:08\
into a studio apartment, where\
a man named Jonathan lived.\
5:11\
Jonathan had been our\
neighbor in another place.\
5:15\
Feeling it wasn't a\
coincidence that the Lord had\
5:18\
put us together,\
we decided to be\
5:20\
more open about our activities\
and membership in the Church.\
5:24\
Jonathan enjoyed our friendship\
and loved spending time\
5:27\
with our family.\
5:28\
He liked learning\
about the gospel,\
5:31\
but he was not interested\
in committing to the Church.\
5:35\
"In time, Jonathan earned\
the nickname 'Uncle Jonathan'\
5:38\
with our children.\
5:39\
As our family continued to\
grow, so did Jonathan's interest\
5:43\
in our happenings.\
5:44\
Our invitations to holiday\
parties, birthdays,\
5:48\
school events, and\
Church activities\
5:50\
extended to family home evenings\
and the children's baptisms.\
5:56\
"One day I received a\
phone call from Jonathan.\
5:59\
He needed help.\
6:00\
He suffered from\
diabetes and had\
6:02\
developed a severe\
foot infection\
6:04\
that required an amputation.\
6:07\
Our family and\
neighboring ward members\
6:10\
walked him through\
that time of trial.\
6:12\
We took turns at the hospital,\
and priesthood blessings\
6:15\
were offered.\
6:16\
While Jonathan was in rehab,\
with the help of Relief Society\
6:20\
sisters, we cleaned\
his apartment.\
6:23\
The priesthood brethren built\
a ramp to his doorway and hand\
6:27\
railings in the bathroom.\
6:29\
When Jonathan returned home,\
he was overcome with emotion.\
6:34\
"Jonathan began taking the\
missionary lessons again.\
6:37\
The week before New Year's,\
he called me and asked,\
6:40\
'What are you doing\
on New Year's Eve?'\
6:43\
I reminded him about\
our annual party.\
6:46\
But instead, he replied, 'I\
want you to come to my baptism!\
6:50\
I want to start this\
new year right.'\
6:53\
After 20 years of 'come and\
see,' 'come and help,' and\
6:56\
'come and stay,' this precious\
soul was ready to be baptized.\
7:02\
"In 2018, when we were called\
to be mission president\
7:05\
and companion, Jonathan's\
health was declining.\
7:08\
We begged him to stay\
strong awaiting our return.\
7:12\
He carried on for almost\
a year, but the Lord\
7:16\
was preparing him to come home.\
7:18\
He passed away\
peacefully in April 2019.\
7:21\
My daughters attended their\
'Uncle Jonathan's' funeral\
7:26\
and sang the same song\
we sang at his baptism."\
7:32\
I introduce the\
second requirement\
7:34\
for successfully sharing the\
message of the Restoration\
7:38\
with this question:\
What is it that\
7:41\
will make your invitation\
appealing to someone?\
7:44\
Isn't it you, the\
example of your life?\
7:48\
Many who have heard and received\
the message of the Restoration\
7:51\
were initially\
attracted by what they\
7:54\
perceived in a member of\
the Church of Jesus Christ.\
7:58\
It may have been the\
way they treated others,\
8:01\
the things they\
said or didn't say,\
8:03\
the steadiness they displayed\
in difficult situations,\
8:08\
or simply their countenance.\
8:11\
Whatever it may be, we cannot\
escape the fact that we need\
8:15\
to understand and live the\
principles of the restored\
8:18\
gospel as best we can for our\
invitations to be inviting.\
8:23\
It is something often referred\
to today as authenticity.\
8:27\
If the love of\
Christ dwells in us,\
8:30\
others will know that our\
love for them is genuine.\
8:33\
If the light of the Holy\
Spirit burns within us,\
8:37\
it will rekindle the Light\
of Christ within them.\
8:40\
What you are lends authenticity\
to your invitation to come\
8:46\
experience the\
joy of the fulness\
8:48\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
8:51\
The third requisite\
is liberal use\
8:53\
of the instrument of\
conversion that God\
8:56\
designed for this last\
gospel dispensation,\
9:00\
the Book of Mormon.\
9:01\
It is palpable evidence of\
Joseph Smith's prophetic\
9:05\
calling and convincing\
evidence of the divinity\
9:09\
and Resurrection\
of Jesus Christ.\
9:12\
Its exposition of our Heavenly\
Father's plan of redemption\
9:16\
is unequalled.\
9:17\
When you share the\
Book of Mormon,\
9:19\
you share the Restoration.\
9:22\
When Jason Olson\
was a teenager, he\
9:25\
was warned repeatedly by\
family members and others\
9:28\
against becoming a Christian.\
9:30\
He had two good\
friends, however,\
9:32\
who were members of The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
9:35\
Saints, and they often\
discussed religion.\
9:38\
His friends, Shea and\
Dave, respectfully\
9:41\
countered arguments that others\
had given Jason against faith\
9:45\
in Jesus Christ.\
9:46\
Finally, they gave him a copy\
of the Book of Mormon, saying,\
9:50\
"This book will\
answer your questions.\
9:52\
Please read it."\
9:54\
He reluctantly accepted\
the book and put it\
9:57\
in his backpack, where it\
stayed for several months.\
10:00\
He didn't want to leave it at\
home where his family might\
10:03\
see it, and he didn't\
want to disappoint\
10:05\
Shea and Dave by returning it.\
10:07\
Finally, he settled on the\
solution of burning the book.\
10:12\
One night, with a\
lighter in one hand\
10:13\
and the Book of\
Mormon in the other,\
10:15\
he was about to set\
fire to the book\
10:17\
when he heard a voice\
in his mind that said,\
10:20\
"Do not burn my book."\
10:22\
Startled, he paused.\
10:24\
Then, thinking he had\
imagined the voice,\
10:27\
he attempted again to\
ignite the lighter.\
10:30\
Again, the voice came to\
his mind: "Go to your room\
10:33\
and read my book."\
10:35\
Jason put the lighter away,\
walked back to his bedroom,\
10:39\
opened the Book of\
Mormon, and began to read.\
10:42\
He continued day\
after day, often\
10:45\
into the early hours\
of the morning.\
10:47\
As Jason came to the end\
and prayed, he recorded,\
10:51\
"I was filled from the crown of\
my head to the soles of my feet\
10:55\
with the Spirit. ...\
10:56\
I felt full of light. ...\
10:58\
It was the most\
joyous experience\
11:00\
I had ever had in my life."\
11:03\
He sought baptism and later\
became a missionary himself.\
11:08\
Perhaps it goes without saying\
that despite genuine love\
11:12\
and sincerity, many, if not\
most, of our invitations\
11:15\
to share the message of the\
Restoration will be declined.\
11:19\
But remember this:\
everyone is worthy of such\
11:23\
an invitation--"all\
are alike unto God";\
11:26\
the Lord is pleased with\
every effort we make,\
11:28\
no matter the outcome; a\
declined invitation is no\
11:33\
reason for our\
association to end;\
11:36\
and a lack of interest today may\
well turn to interest tomorrow.\
11:40\
Regardless, our love\
remains constant.\
11:45\
Let us never forget that\
the Restoration has come out\
11:48\
of intense ordeal and sacrifice.\
11:51\
That is a subject\
for another day.\
11:54\
Today we rejoice in the\
fruits of the Restoration, one\
11:59\
of the most surpassing\
being the power\
12:02\
once again to bind on\
earth and in heaven.\
12:05\
As expressed years ago by\
President Gordon B. Hinckley,\
12:09\
"If nothing else came\
out of all of the sorrow\
12:13\
and travail and pain\
of the Restoration\
12:16\
than the sealing power\
of the holy priesthood\
12:20\
to bind together\
families forever,\
12:22\
it would have been worth\
all that it has cost."\
12:26\
The ultimate promise\
of the Restoration\
12:28\
is redemption\
through Jesus Christ.\
12:31\
The Resurrection of Jesus Christ\
is the proof that He in fact\
12:36\
possesses power to redeem all\
who will come unto Him--redeem\
12:40\
them from sorrow, injustice,\
regret, sin, and even death.\
12:45\
Today is Palm Sunday; a\
week from today is Easter.\
12:49\
We remember, we always remember,\
Christ's suffering and death\
12:55\
to atone for our sins, and we\
celebrate that most wonderful\
13:00\
of Sundays, the Lord's Day, on\
which He rose from the dead.\
13:03\
Because of the Resurrection\
of Jesus Christ,\
13:07\
the Restoration has meaning,\
our mortal lives have meaning,\
13:12\
and ultimately our very\
existence has meaning.\
13:16\
Joseph Smith, the great\
prophet of the Restoration,\
13:19\
offers the overarching testimony\
for our time of the resurrected\
13:23\
Christ: "That he lives!\
13:26\
For we saw him, even on\
the right hand of God."\
13:29\
I humbly add my witness\
to Joseph's and to that\
13:32\
of the apostles and\
prophets before him\
13:35\
and the apostles and prophets\
who have succeeded him,\
13:38\
that Jesus of Nazareth\
is the promised Messiah,\
13:42\
the Only Begotten Son of\
God, and the resurrected\
13:45\
Redeemer of all mankind.\
13:48\
"We testify that\
those who prayerfully\
13:50\
study the message of the\
Restoration and act in faith\
13:54\
will be blessed to gain their\
own witness of its divinity\
13:58\
and of its purpose to prepare\
the world for the promised\
14:02\
Second Coming of our Lord\
and Savior, Jesus Christ."\
14:06\
Christ's Resurrection\
makes His promises sure.\
14:10\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
