Back in the mid-90s,\
during my college years,\
0:03\
I was part of the Fourth\
Company of the Santiago Fire\
0:06\
Department in Chile.\
0:08\
While serving there, I\
lived at the fire station\
0:11\
as part of the night guard.\
0:12\
Toward the end of\
the year, I was\
0:15\
told that I had to be at the\
fire station on New Year's Eve\
0:18\
because on that day there was\
almost always some emergency.\
0:24\
Surprised, I replied, "Really?"\
0:27\
Well, I remember waiting\
with my associates\
0:30\
when, at midnight,\
fireworks began shooting off\
0:34\
in downtown Santiago.\
0:36\
We started hugging each\
other with well wishes\
0:39\
for the new year.\
0:40\
Suddenly the bells\
at the fire station\
0:43\
began ringing, indicating\
that there was an emergency.\
0:47\
We got our equipment and\
jumped on the fire engine.\
0:51\
On our way to the\
emergency, as we\
0:54\
passed crowds of people\
celebrating the new year,\
0:57\
I noticed that they were largely\
unconcerned and carefree.\
1:03\
They were relaxed and enjoying\
the warm summer night.\
1:07\
Yet somewhere nearby, the\
people we were hurrying to help\
1:12\
were in serious trouble.\
1:14\
This experience\
helped me realize\
1:17\
that although our lives may\
at times be relatively smooth,\
1:21\
the time will come\
for each of us\
1:24\
when we will face unexpected\
challenges and storms that\
1:29\
will push the limits of\
our ability to endure.\
1:32\
Physical, mental, family,\
and employment challenges;\
1:37\
natural disasters; and other\
matters of life or death\
1:41\
are but some of the\
examples of the storms\
1:44\
that we will face in this life.\
1:47\
When faced with these\
storms, we often\
1:50\
experience feelings\
of despair or fear.\
1:54\
President Russell\
M. Nelson said,\
1:56\
"Faith is the antidote for\
fear"--faith in our Lord Jesus\
2:03\
Christ.\
2:04\
As I have seen the storms\
that affect people's lives,\
2:08\
I have concluded that no matter\
what kind of storm is battering\
2:11\
us--regardless of whether there\
is a solution to it or whether\
2:16\
there is an end in sight--there\
is only one refuge,\
2:20\
and it is the same for\
all type of storms.\
2:24\
This single refuge provided\
by our Heavenly Father\
2:28\
is our Lord Jesus Christ\
and His Atonement.\
2:33\
None of us are exempt\
from facing these storms.\
2:37\
Helaman, a Book of Mormon\
prophet, taught us as follows:\
2:42\
"Remember that it is upon\
the rock of our Redeemer,\
2:45\
who is Christ, the Son of\
God, that ye must build\
2:49\
your foundation; that when\
the devil shall send forth his\
2:52\
mighty winds, yea, his\
shafts in the whirlwind, yea,\
2:57\
when all his hail and his mighty\
storm shall beat upon you,\
3:01\
it shall have no power over you\
to drag you down to the gulf\
3:05\
of misery and endless wo,\
because of the rock upon which\
3:10\
ye are built, which\
is a sure foundation,\
3:13\
a foundation whereon if men\
build they cannot fall."\
3:19\
Elder Robert D. Hales, who\
had his own experiences\
3:23\
with enduring storms, said:\
"Suffering is universal;\
3:28\
how we react to\
suffering is individual.\
3:31\
Suffering can take\
us one of two ways.\
3:35\
It can be a strengthening and\
purifying experience combined\
3:39\
with faith, or it can be a\
destructive force in our lives\
3:43\
if we do not have the faith in\
the Lord's atoning sacrifice."\
3:50\
In order to enjoy the refuge\
that Jesus Christ and His\
3:53\
Atonement offer, we must have\
faith in Him--a faith that will\
3:58\
allow us to rise above all\
the pains of a limited,\
4:02\
earthly perspective.\
4:04\
He has promised that He\
will make our burdens\
4:07\
light if we come unto\
Him in all that we do.\
4:11\
"Come unto me," He said, "all\
ye that labour and are heavy\
4:15\
laden, and I will give you rest.\
4:18\
"Take my yoke upon\
you, and learn of me;\
4:21\
for I am meek and\
lowly in heart: and ye\
4:24\
shall find rest unto your souls.\
4:26\
"For my yoke is easy,\
and my burden is light."\
4:32\
It is said that "to\
one who has faith,\
4:34\
no explanation is necessary.\
4:36\
To one without faith, no\
explanation is possible."\
4:40\
However, we have\
limited understanding\
4:43\
of the things that\
happen here on earth,\
4:45\
and often we do not have\
answers to the question of why.\
4:50\
Why is this happening?\
4:52\
Why is this happening to me?\
4:55\
What am I supposed to learn?\
4:58\
When answers evade us, that\
is when the words expressed\
5:02\
by our Savior to the Prophet\
Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail\
5:05\
are completely applicable:\
5:08\
"My son, peace be unto\
thy soul; thine adversity\
5:13\
and thine afflictions shall\
be but a small moment;\
5:16\
"And then, if thou\
endure it well,\
5:18\
God shall exalt thee on high."\
5:22\
Although many people indeed\
believe in Jesus Christ,\
5:26\
the key question is\
whether we believe Him\
5:29\
and whether we believe\
the things that He\
5:31\
teaches us and asks us to do.\
5:34\
Perhaps someone might think,\
"What does Jesus Christ know\
5:37\
about what is happening to me?\
5:39\
How does He know what\
I need to be happy?"\
5:42\
Truly, it was our\
Redeemer and Intercessor\
5:46\
to whom the prophet Isaiah\
was referring when he said:\
5:50\
"He is despised and rejected\
of men; a man of sorrows,\
5:54\
and acquainted with grief. ...\
5:56\
"Surely he hath\
borne our griefs,\
5:59\
and carried our sorrows.\
6:01\
...\
6:02\
"But he was wounded\
for our transgressions,\
6:04\
he was bruised for\
our iniquities:\
6:07\
the chastisement of\
our peace was upon him;\
6:10\
and with his stripes\
we are healed."\
6:14\
The Apostle Peter also taught\
us about the Savior, saying,\
6:17\
"Who his own self bare our sins\
in his own body on the tree,\
6:22\
that we, being dead to sins,\
should live unto righteousness:\
6:26\
by whose stripes\
ye were healed."\
6:29\
Although the time of Peter's\
own martyrdom was approaching,\
6:33\
his words are not filled\
with fear or pessimism;\
6:37\
rather, he taught the\
Saints to "rejoice"\
6:40\
even though they\
were "in heaviness\
6:42\
through manifold temptations."\
6:44\
Peter counseled us to remember\
that "the trial of [our] faith,\
6:49\
... though it be\
tried with fire,"\
6:50\
would lead to "praise and honour\
and glory at the appearing\
6:54\
of Jesus Christ" and to "the\
salvation of [our] souls."\
6:58\
PETER CONTINUED: "Beloved,\
think it not strange\
7:02\
concerning the fiery\
trial which is to try you,\
7:05\
as though some strange\
thing happened unto you:\
7:09\
"But rejoice, inasmuch\
as ye are partakers\
7:12\
of Christ's\
sufferings; that, when\
7:14\
his glory shall be revealed,\
ye may be glad also\
7:18\
with exceeding joy."\
7:21\
President Russell\
M. Nelson taught\
7:22\
that "Saints can be happy\
under every circumstance.\
7:27\
...\
7:27\
When the focus of our lives is\
on God's plan of salvation ...\
7:31\
and Jesus Christ and His gospel,\
we can feel joy regardless\
7:35\
of what is happening--or\
not happening--in our lives.\
7:39\
Joy comes from and\
because of Him.\
7:43\
He is the source of all joy."\
7:47\
Of course, it is easier to say\
these things when we are not\
7:53\
in the midst of a storm\
than to live and apply them\
7:56\
during the storm.\
7:58\
But as your brother, I hope\
you can feel that I sincerely\
8:03\
want to share with\
you how valuable it\
8:06\
is to know that Jesus\
Christ and His Atonement\
8:09\
are the refuge that we all need,\
regardless of the storms that\
8:13\
are battering our lives.\
8:15\
I know that we are all children\
of God, that He loves us,\
8:20\
and that we are not alone.\
8:23\
I invite you to\
come and see that He\
8:26\
can lighten your burdens and\
be the refuge you are seeking.\
8:30\
Come and help others find the\
refuge that they so yearn for.\
8:35\
Come and stay with\
us in this refuge,\
8:38\
which will help you\
resist the storms of life.\
8:41\
There is no doubt in my heart\
that if you come, you will see,\
8:47\
you will help,\
and you will stay.\
8:51\
The prophet Alma testified the\
following to his son Helaman:\
8:55\
"I do know that whosoever\
shall put their trust in God\
9:00\
shall be supported in their\
trials, and their troubles,\
9:04\
and their afflictions, and shall\
be lifted up at the last day."\
9:10\
THE SAVIOR HIMSELF SAID: "Let\
your hearts be comforted ... ;\
9:14\
for all flesh is in mine hands;\
be still and know that I am\
9:20\
God.\
9:21\
"...\
9:21\
Wherefore, fear not even\
unto death; for in this world\
9:26\
your joy is not full, but\
in me your joy is full."\
9:33\
The hymn "Be Still,\
My Soul," which\
9:36\
has touched my heart\
on many occasions,\
9:38\
has a message of\
comfort for our souls.\
9:41\
The lyrics read as follows:\
9:44\
"Be still, my soul: The\
hour is hast'ning on\
9:48\
When we shall be\
forever with the Lord,\
9:52\
When disappointment,\
grief, and fear are gone,\
9:56\
Sorrow forgot, love's\
purest joys restored.\
10:02\
BE STILL, MY SOUL: When\
change and tears are past,\
10:06\
All safe and blessed\
we shall meet at last."\
10:12\
As we face the storms of life,\
I know that if we make our best\
10:18\
effort and rely upon Jesus\
Christ and His Atonement\
10:21\
as our refuge, we will be\
blessed with the relief,\
10:26\
comfort, strength, temperance,\
and peace that we are seeking,\
10:31\
with certainty in our hearts\
that at the end of our time\
10:35\
here on earth we will hear\
the words of the Master:\
10:39\
"Well done, thou good\
and faithful servant: ...\
10:43\
enter thou into the\
joy of thy lord."\
10:47\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
