DEAR BROTHERS AND SISTERS:\
with hosanna and hallelujah,\
0:07\
we celebrate the\
living Jesus Christ\
0:10\
at this season of continuing\
Restoration and Easter.\
0:14\
With perfect love,\
our Savior assures us:\
0:18\
"In me ye might have peace.\
0:21\
In the world ye shall\
have tribulation:\
0:23\
but be of good cheer; I\
have overcome the world."\
0:28\
Some years ago, as Sister Gong\
and I met a lovely family,\
0:32\
their young daughter Ivy shyly\
brought out her violin case.\
0:37\
She lifted out the violin bow,\
tightened and put rosin on it.\
0:41\
Then she put the bow back in the\
case, curtsied, and sat down.\
0:46\
A new beginner,\
she had just shared\
0:48\
all she knew about the violin.\
0:51\
Now, years later, Ivy plays\
the violin beautifully.\
0:56\
In this mortal period,\
we are all a little\
0:59\
like Ivy and her violin.\
1:01\
We begin at the beginning.\
1:03\
With practice and persistence,\
we grow and improve.\
1:07\
With the passage of time, moral\
agency and mortal experiences\
1:12\
help us become more\
like our Savior as we\
1:15\
labor with Him in His vineyard\
and follow His covenant path.\
1:19\
Anniversaries, including\
this bicentennial,\
1:22\
highlight patterns\
of restoration.\
1:25\
In celebrating the\
ongoing Restoration\
1:28\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ,\
we also prepare for Easter.\
1:33\
In both, we rejoice in the\
return of Jesus Christ.\
1:37\
He lives--not only then,\
but now; not just for some,\
1:43\
but for all.\
1:44\
He came and comes to\
heal the brokenhearted,\
1:48\
deliver the captives,\
recover sight to the blind,\
1:51\
and set at liberty\
those who are bruised.\
1:54\
That's each of us.\
1:56\
His redeeming promises apply,\
no matter our past, our present,\
2:00\
or concerns for our future.\
2:04\
Tomorrow is Palm Sunday.\
2:05\
Traditionally, palms\
are a sacred symbol\
2:08\
to express joy in our Lord.\
2:10\
As in Christ's triumphal\
entry into Jerusalem,\
2:14\
"much people ... took\
branches of palm trees,\
2:16\
and went forth to meet him."\
2:19\
You may be interested\
to know the original\
2:21\
of this beloved Harry\
Anderson painting\
2:24\
hangs in President Russell\
M. Nelson's office,\
2:27\
just behind his desk.\
2:29\
In the book of Revelation, those\
who praise God and the Lamb\
2:34\
do so "clothed with white robes,\
and palms in their hands."\
2:39\
Along with "robes\
of righteousness"\
2:41\
and "crowns of glory," palms are\
included in the Kirtland Temple\
2:45\
dedicatory prayer.\
2:47\
Of course, the\
significance of Palm Sunday\
2:49\
goes beyond crowds\
greeting Jesus with palms.\
2:52\
On Palm Sunday, Jesus\
entered Jerusalem\
2:56\
in ways the faithful recognized\
as fulfillment of prophecy.\
3:00\
As Zechariah and the Psalmist\
prophetically foretold,\
3:04\
our Lord entered\
Jerusalem riding a colt\
3:07\
as multitudes knowingly cried,\
"Hosanna in the highest."\
3:12\
Hosanna means "save now."\
3:15\
Then as now, we rejoice,\
"Blessed [is] he\
3:19\
that cometh in the\
name of the Lord."\
3:22\
A week following Palm\
Sunday is Easter Sunday.\
3:26\
President Nelson\
teaches Jesus Christ\
3:28\
"came to pay a debt He\
didn't owe because we\
3:31\
owed a debt we couldn't pay."\
3:34\
Indeed, through the\
Atonement of Christ,\
3:36\
all God's children "may be\
saved, by obedience to the laws\
3:41\
and ordinances of the Gospel."\
3:43\
At Easter, we sing hallelujah.\
3:46\
Hallelujah means "praise\
ye the Lord Jehovah."\
3:50\
The "Hallelujah Chorus"\
in Handel's Messiah\
3:53\
is a beloved Easter declaration\
that He is "King of Kings,\
3:57\
and Lord of Lords."\
3:59\
The sacred events between\
Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday\
4:03\
are the story of\
hosanna and hallelujah.\
4:07\
Hosanna is our plea\
for God to save.\
4:10\
Hallelujah expresses our\
praise to the Lord for the hope\
4:14\
of salvation and exaltation.\
4:17\
In hosanna and hallelujah,\
we recognize the living Jesus\
4:22\
Christ as the heart of Easter\
and latter-day Restoration.\
4:29\
Latter-day Restoration begins\
with theophany--the literal\
4:33\
appearance of God the Father\
and His Son, Jesus Christ,\
4:36\
to the young prophet\
Joseph Smith.\
4:38\
Said the Prophet Joseph, "Could\
you gaze into heaven five\
4:42\
minutes, you would know more\
than you would by reading all\
4:46\
that ... was [ever]\
written on the subject."\
4:48\
Because the heavens\
are again open,\
4:50\
we know and "believe in God, the\
Eternal Father, and in His Son,\
4:55\
Jesus Christ, and in the Holy\
Ghost"--the divine Godhead.\
5:01\
On Easter Sunday, April\
3, 1836, in the early days\
5:05\
of the Restoration,\
the living Jesus Christ\
5:08\
appeared when the Kirtland\
Temple was dedicated.\
5:11\
Those who saw Him\
there testified\
5:14\
of Him in complementary\
contrasts of fire and water:\
5:19\
"His eyes were as a flame of\
fire; the hair of his head\
5:24\
was white like the pure\
snow; his countenance\
5:27\
shone above the\
brightness of the sun;\
5:29\
and his voice was the sound of\
the rushing of great waters,\
5:33\
even the voice of Jehovah."\
5:36\
On that occasion,\
our Savior declared,\
5:39\
"I am the first and the\
last; I am he who liveth,\
5:44\
I am he who was slain; I am\
your advocate with the Father."\
5:49\
Again, complementary\
contrasts--first and last,\
5:55\
living and slain.\
5:57\
He is Alpha and Omega,\
the beginning and the end,\
6:01\
the author and\
finisher of our faith.\
6:05\
Following the appearance\
of Jesus Christ,\
6:07\
Moses, Elias, and\
Elijah also came.\
6:10\
By divine direction, these\
great prophets of old\
6:14\
restored priesthood\
keys and authority.\
6:16\
Thus, "the keys of\
this dispensation\
6:19\
are committed" within\
His restored Church\
6:22\
to bless all God's children.\
6:25\
The coming of Elijah\
in the Kirtland Temple\
6:27\
also fulfilled Malachi's\
Old Testament prophecy\
6:31\
that Elijah would return\
"before the coming\
6:33\
of the great and dreadful\
day of the Lord."\
6:36\
In doing so, Elijah's\
appearance coincided,\
6:40\
though not by coincidence, with\
the Jewish Passover season,\
6:44\
which tradition reverently\
anticipates Elijah's return.\
6:49\
Many devout Jewish families\
set a place for Elijah\
6:52\
at their Passover table.\
6:54\
Many fill a cup to the brim\
to invite and welcome him.\
6:58\
And some, during the\
traditional Passover Seder,\
7:01\
send a child to the door,\
sometimes left partly open,\
7:05\
to see if Elijah is outside\
waiting to be invited in.\
7:11\
In fulfillment of\
prophecy and as part\
7:14\
of the promised\
Restoration of all things,\
7:17\
Elijah did come as\
promised, at Easter\
7:21\
and the onset of Passover.\
7:23\
He brought the sealing\
authority to bind families\
7:26\
on earth and in heaven.\
7:27\
As Moroni taught\
the Prophet Joseph,\
7:30\
Elijah "shall plant in\
the hearts of the children\
7:34\
the promises made\
to the fathers,\
7:36\
and the hearts of the children\
shall turn to their fathers.\
7:40\
If it were not so,"\
Moroni continued,\
7:43\
"the whole earth\
would be utterly\
7:45\
wasted at [the Lord's] coming."\
7:48\
The spirit of Elijah, a\
manifestation of the Holy\
7:51\
Ghost, draws us to our\
generations--past, present,\
7:56\
and future--in our genealogies,\
histories, and temple service.\
8:03\
Let us also briefly recall\
what Passover signifies.\
8:07\
Passover remembers\
the deliverance\
8:09\
of the children of Israel\
from 400 years of bondage.\
8:12\
The book of Exodus relates\
how this deliverance\
8:16\
came after plagues of\
frogs, lice, flies,\
8:20\
the death of cattle, boils,\
blains, hail and fire,\
8:23\
locusts, and thick darkness.\
8:25\
The final plague threatened\
the death of the firstborn\
8:28\
in the land but not in the\
house of Israel if--if those\
8:33\
households put the blood of\
an unblemished firstling lamb\
8:37\
on the lintels of their doors.\
8:40\
The angel of death\
passed by the houses\
8:42\
marked with the symbolic\
blood of the lamb.\
8:44\
That passing by, or pass\
over, represents Jesus Christ\
8:50\
ultimately overcoming death.\
8:53\
Indeed, the atoning\
blood of the Lamb of God\
8:56\
gives our Good Shepherd power to\
gather His people in all places\
9:01\
and circumstances into\
the safety of His fold\
9:05\
on both sides of the veil.\
9:09\
Significantly, the Book of\
Mormon describes the "power\
9:13\
and resurrection of Christ"--the\
essence of Easter--in terms\
9:18\
of two restorations.\
9:21\
First, resurrection includes\
physical restoration\
9:26\
of our "proper and perfect\
frame"; "every limb and joint,"\
9:29\
"even a hair of the\
head shall not be lost."\
9:32\
This promise gives\
hope to those who\
9:34\
have lost limbs, who have lost\
ability to see, hear, or walk,\
9:38\
or those thought lost\
to relentless disease,\
9:42\
mental illness, or other\
diminished capacity.\
9:46\
He finds us.\
9:48\
He makes us whole.\
9:52\
A second promise of Easter\
and our Lord's Atonement\
9:54\
is that, spiritually, "all\
things shall be restored\
9:58\
to their proper order."\
9:59\
This spiritual restoration\
reflects our works and desires.\
10:04\
Like bread upon the water, it\
restores "that which is good,"\
10:08\
"righteous," "just,"\
and "merciful."\
10:11\
No wonder the prophet Alma uses\
the word restore 22 times as he\
10:17\
urges us to "deal justly,\
judge righteously, and do good\
10:21\
continually."\
10:23\
Because "God himself atoneth\
for the sins of the world,"\
10:27\
the Lord's Atonement can\
make whole not only what was\
10:32\
but what can be.\
10:34\
Because He knows our pains,\
afflictions, sicknesses,\
10:38\
our "temptations of every kind,"\
He can, with mercy, succor us\
10:43\
according to our infirmities.\
10:45\
Because God is "a perfect, just\
God, and a merciful God also,"\
10:51\
the plan of mercy can appease\
the demands of justice.\
10:55\
We repent and do all we can.\
10:58\
He encircles us eternally\
"in the arms of his love."\
11:04\
Today we celebrate\
restoration and resurrection.\
11:09\
With you, I rejoice in\
the ongoing Restoration\
11:13\
of the fulness of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
11:16\
As began 200 years\
ago this spring,\
11:19\
light and revelation continue\
to come forth through\
11:22\
the Lord's living\
prophet and His Church,\
11:26\
called in His name--The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
11:30\
Saints--and through personal\
revelation and inspiration\
11:35\
by the supernal gift\
of the Holy Ghost.\
11:39\
With you, at this\
Easter season, I\
11:42\
testify of God, our Eternal\
Father, and His Beloved\
11:46\
Son, the living Jesus Christ.\
11:49\
Mortal men were\
cruelly crucified\
11:52\
and later resurrected.\
11:54\
But only the living Jesus Christ\
in His perfect resurrected form\
12:00\
still bears the\
marks of crucifixion\
12:03\
in His hands, feet, and side.\
12:07\
Only He can say,\
"I have graven thee\
12:11\
upon the palms of my hands."\
12:14\
Only He can say, "I am\
he who was lifted up.\
12:19\
I am Jesus that was crucified.\
12:23\
I am the Son of God."\
12:28\
Like little Ivy\
and her violin, we\
12:31\
are in some ways\
still beginning.\
12:33\
Truly, "eye hath not seen, nor\
ear heard, neither have entered\
12:38\
into the heart of man, the\
things which God hath prepared\
12:42\
for them that love him."\
12:44\
In these times, we can\
learn much of God's goodness\
12:49\
and our divine\
potential for God's love\
12:52\
to grow in us as we seek\
Him and reach out to others.\
12:57\
In new ways and new places,\
we can do and become,\
13:03\
line upon line,\
kindness upon kindness,\
13:07\
individually and together.\
13:11\
Dear brothers and\
sisters everywhere,\
13:13\
as we meet and learn together,\
your faith and goodness\
13:18\
fill me with a sense of gospel\
adventure and gratitude.\
13:21\
Your testimony\
and gospel journey\
13:24\
enrich my testimony\
and gospel journey.\
13:28\
Your concerns and joys, your\
love for the household of God\
13:32\
and community of Saints,\
and your lived understanding\
13:35\
of restored truth\
and light increase\
13:38\
my fulness of restored gospel,\
with the living Jesus Christ\
13:43\
at its heart.\
13:45\
Together we trust, "thru\
cloud and sunshine, Lord,\
13:50\
abide with me!"\
13:52\
Unitedly we know, amidst\
our loads and cares,\
13:57\
we can count our many blessings.\
14:00\
In the daily details of\
small and simple things,\
14:04\
we can see great things\
brought to pass in our lives.\
14:10\
"And it shall come to pass that\
the righteous shall be gathered\
14:14\
out from ... all nations,\
and shall come to Zion,\
14:17\
singing with songs\
of everlasting joy."\
14:20\
At this season of\
hosanna and hallelujah,\
14:25\
sing hallelujah--for He\
shall reign forever and ever!\
14:31\
Shout hosanna, to\
God and the Lamb!\
14:35\
In the sacred and holy\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
