What a unique and wonderful\
session this has been!\
0:05\
Thank you, dear Laudy and Enzo.\
0:08\
You represented the magnificent\
young women and young men\
0:12\
of the Church so very well.\
0:16\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
we have heard much today about\
0:19\
the Restoration of the\
Church--the very Church that\
0:23\
our Savior, Jesus Christ,\
established during His earthly\
0:26\
ministry.\
0:29\
That Restoration began\
200 years ago this spring\
0:32\
when God the Father and\
His Son, Jesus Christ,\
0:35\
appeared to the\
young Joseph Smith.\
0:39\
Ten years after this\
transcendent vision,\
0:41\
the Prophet Joseph\
Smith and five others\
0:44\
were called as founding members\
of the Lord's restored Church.\
0:50\
From that small group\
assembled on April 6, 1830,\
0:54\
has come a global\
organization of more than 16\
0:59\
million members.\
1:01\
The good this\
Church accomplishes\
1:04\
around the world to\
alleviate human suffering\
1:07\
and provide uplift for\
humankind is widely known.\
1:12\
But its prime purpose\
is to help men, women,\
1:16\
and children follow\
the Lord Jesus Christ,\
1:19\
to keep His commandments, and\
qualify for the greatest of all\
1:25\
blessings--that of eternal life\
with God and their loved ones.\
1:33\
As we commemorate the event\
that was launched in 1820,\
1:37\
it is important to remember\
that while we revere\
1:43\
Joseph Smith as\
a prophet of God,\
1:46\
this is not the church\
of Joseph Smith,\
1:50\
nor is it the church of Mormon.\
1:54\
This is the Church\
of Jesus Christ.\
1:57\
He decreed exactly what His\
Church should be called:\
2:02\
"For thus shall my church\
be called in the last days,\
2:06\
even The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints."\
2:14\
I have spoken previously\
about a needed course\
2:16\
correction in the way we refer\
to the name of the Church.\
2:20\
Since that time,\
much has been done\
2:23\
to accomplish this correction.\
2:25\
I am very grateful to\
President M. Russell\
2:28\
Ballard and the entire Quorum\
of the Twelve Apostles, who\
2:33\
have done so much to lead\
these efforts as well\
2:37\
as those related to\
another initiative\
2:40\
that I will announce\
this evening.\
2:45\
Church leaders and\
departments, related entities,\
2:48\
and millions of members--and\
others--now use the correct\
2:52\
name of the Church.\
2:53\
The Church's official style\
guide has been adjusted.\
2:57\
The Church's principal website\
is now ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\
3:05\
Addresses for email, domain\
names, and social media\
3:09\
channels have been updated.\
3:12\
Our beloved choir is\
now The Tabernacle Choir\
3:15\
at Temple Square.\
3:18\
We have gone to these\
extraordinary efforts\
3:21\
because when we\
remove the Lord's name\
3:23\
from the name of His Church,\
we inadvertently remove Him\
3:29\
as the central focus of\
our worship and our lives.\
3:37\
When we take the Savior's\
name upon us at baptism,\
3:41\
we commit to witness, by our\
words, thoughts, and actions,\
3:45\
that Jesus is the Christ.\
3:50\
Previously, I\
promised that if we\
3:52\
would "do our best to restore\
the correct name of the Lord's\
3:55\
Church," He would "pour\
down His power and blessings\
3:59\
upon the heads of the Latter-day\
Saints, the likes of which we\
4:03\
have never seen."\
4:04\
I renew that promise today.\
4:10\
To help us remember\
Him and to identify\
4:13\
The Church of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints as the Lord's\
4:16\
Church, we are\
pleased to introduce\
4:19\
a symbol that will signify\
the central place of Jesus\
4:23\
Christ in His Church.\
4:26\
This symbol includes the\
name of the Church contained\
4:30\
within a cornerstone.\
4:32\
Jesus Christ is the\
chief cornerstone.\
4:37\
At the center of the\
symbol is a representation\
4:40\
of Thorvaldsen's marble\
statue the Christus.\
4:45\
It portrays the\
resurrected, living\
4:48\
Lord reaching out to embrace\
all who will come unto Him.\
4:54\
Symbolically, Jesus Christ\
is standing under an arch.\
4:59\
The arch reminds us of\
the resurrected Savior\
5:03\
emerging from the tomb on\
the third day following\
5:06\
His Crucifixion.\
5:10\
This symbol should\
feel familiar to many,\
5:12\
as we have long\
identified the restored\
5:14\
gospel with the living,\
resurrected Christ.\
5:20\
The symbol will now be\
used as a visual identifier\
5:23\
for official literature, news,\
and events of the Church.\
5:28\
It will remind all that\
this is the Savior's Church\
5:34\
and that all we do as\
members of His Church centers\
5:38\
on Jesus Christ and His gospel.\
5:46\
Now, my dear\
brothers and sisters,\
5:47\
tomorrow is Palm Sunday, as\
Elder Gong has so eloquently\
5:52\
taught.\
5:53\
Then we enter the special week\
that culminates with Easter.\
5:59\
As followers of\
Jesus Christ, living\
6:02\
in a day when the\
COVID-19 pandemic has\
6:06\
put the whole\
world in commotion,\
6:10\
let us not just talk of\
Christ or preach of Christ\
6:15\
or employ a symbol\
representing Christ.\
6:21\
Let us put our faith in the\
Lord Jesus Christ into action!\
6:28\
As you know, members\
of the Church\
6:31\
observe the law of the\
fast one day each month.\
6:36\
The doctrine of\
fasting is ancient.\
6:38\
It has been practiced\
by biblical heroes\
6:42\
from the earliest days.\
6:45\
Moses, David, Ezra, Nehemiah,\
Esther, Isaiah, Daniel, Joel,\
6:54\
and many others fasted\
and preached of fasting.\
7:00\
Through Isaiah's writings, the\
Lord said: "Is not this the\
7:07\
fast that I have chosen?\
7:10\
to loose the bands\
of wickedness,\
7:13\
to undo the heavy burdens, and\
to let the oppressed go free?"\
7:20\
The Apostle Paul admonished\
Saints in Corinth\
7:27\
to "give yourselves to\
fasting and prayer."\
7:31\
The Savior Himself declared\
that certain things go "not out\
7:37\
but by prayer and fasting."\
7:42\
I said recently in a\
social media video that\
7:47\
"as a physician and surgeon, I\
have tremendous respect for ...\
7:51\
medical professionals,\
scientists,\
7:53\
and others who are working\
around the clock to curb\
7:57\
the spread of COVID-19."\
8:00\
Now, as President of The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
8:04\
Saints and an Apostle\
of Jesus Christ,\
8:08\
I know that God "has all\
power, all wisdom, ...\
8:12\
all understanding; he\
comprehendeth all things,\
8:17\
and he is a merciful\
Being, even unto salvation,\
8:22\
to those who will repent\
and believe on his name."\
8:28\
So, during times\
of deep distress,\
8:30\
as when illness reaches\
pandemic proportions,\
8:34\
the most natural thing for us to\
do is to call upon our Heavenly\
8:38\
Father and His Son--the Master\
Healer--to show forth Their\
8:44\
marvelous power to bless\
the people of the earth.\
8:50\
In my video message,\
I invited all\
8:52\
to join in fasting on\
Sunday, March 29, 2020.\
8:55\
Many of you may have seen the\
video and joined in the fast.\
9:01\
Some may have not.\
9:05\
Now we still need\
help from heaven.\
9:08\
So tonight, my dear\
brothers and sisters,\
9:11\
in the spirit of\
the sons of Mosiah,\
9:13\
who gave themselves to\
much fasting and prayer,\
9:16\
and as part of our April\
2020 general conference,\
9:21\
I am calling for\
another worldwide fast.\
9:25\
For all whose health may\
permit, let us fast, pray,\
9:31\
and unite our faith once again.\
9:35\
Let us prayerfully\
plead for relief\
9:39\
from this global pandemic.\
9:42\
I invite all, including\
those not of our faith,\
9:45\
to fast and pray on\
Good Friday, April 10,\
9:51\
that the present pandemic\
may be controlled,\
9:55\
caregivers protected,\
the economy strengthened,\
10:00\
and life normalized.\
10:05\
How do we fast?\
10:07\
Two meals or a period of\
24 hours is customary.\
10:11\
But you decide what would\
constitute a sacrifice for you,\
10:17\
as you remember the supreme\
sacrifice the Savior made\
10:21\
for you.\
10:23\
Let us unite in pleading for\
healing throughout the world.\
10:30\
Good Friday would be the perfect\
day to have our Heavenly Father\
10:34\
and His Son hear us!\
10:41\
Dear brothers and sisters, I\
express my deep love for you,\
10:45\
along with my testimony of\
the divinity of the work\
10:48\
in which we are engaged.\
10:50\
This is The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
10:55\
He stands at its head and\
directs all that we do.\
11:01\
I know that He will respond to\
the pleadings of His people.\
11:05\
I so testify in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
