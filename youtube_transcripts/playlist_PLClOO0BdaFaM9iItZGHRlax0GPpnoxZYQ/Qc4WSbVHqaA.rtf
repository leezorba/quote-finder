Today I will speak on continuing\
revelation to prophets\
0:06\
and continuing personal\
revelation to guide our lives.\
0:10\
Sometimes we receive\
revelation even when we do not\
0:14\
know the Lord's purposes.\
0:16\
Shortly before Elder\
Jeffrey R. Holland\
0:18\
was called to be an\
Apostle in June of 1994,\
0:20\
I had a beautiful\
revelatory experience\
0:25\
that he would be called.\
0:27\
I was a regional\
representative and could\
0:29\
see no reason I would\
be given that knowledge.\
0:32\
But we were companions\
as young missionaries\
0:35\
in England in the early 1960s,\
and I had a great love for him.\
0:40\
I considered the experience\
a tender mercy for me.\
0:45\
In recent years, I have wondered\
if the Lord was preparing\
0:50\
me to be junior in the Twelve\
to an incredible missionary\
0:54\
companion who was my\
junior companion when\
0:57\
we were young missionaries.\
0:59\
I sometimes warn\
young missionaries\
1:01\
to be kind to their\
junior companions\
1:03\
because they never\
know when they might\
1:06\
be their senior companion.\
1:09\
I have a firm\
testimony that this\
1:11\
restored Church is led by\
our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
1:15\
He knows who to\
call as His Apostles\
1:18\
and in what order to call them.\
1:21\
He also knows how to\
prepare His senior Apostle\
1:24\
to be the prophet and\
President of the Church.\
1:29\
We were blessed\
this morning to hear\
1:31\
our beloved prophet,\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
1:34\
deliver a profound\
bicentennial proclamation\
1:38\
to the world with respect to\
the Restoration of the fulness\
1:42\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
1:44\
This seminal declaration\
by President Nelson\
1:47\
has made it clear that\
the Church of Jesus Christ\
1:52\
owes its origin, existence,\
and direction for the future\
1:57\
to the principle of\
continuous revelation.\
2:01\
The new proclamation represents\
a loving Father's communication\
2:05\
to His children.\
2:08\
In an earlier day,\
President Spencer W. Kimball\
2:11\
expressed the\
feelings I have today.\
2:13\
He stated: "Of all\
things that ...\
2:16\
we should be most grateful [for]\
is that the heavens are indeed\
2:20\
open and that the restored\
church of Jesus Christ is\
2:24\
founded upon the\
rock of revelation.\
2:27\
Continuous revelation is\
indeed the very lifeblood\
2:31\
of the gospel of the living\
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."\
2:37\
The prophet Enoch foresaw\
the days in which we live.\
2:41\
The Lord acknowledged to\
Enoch the great wickedness\
2:44\
that would prevail\
and prophesied\
2:47\
of the "great tribulations"\
that would occur.\
2:50\
Nevertheless, the Lord\
promised, "But my people\
2:53\
will I preserve."\
2:55\
"And righteousness will I send\
down out of heaven; and truth\
3:00\
will I send forth\
out of the earth,\
3:02\
to bear testimony of\
mine Only Begotten."\
3:06\
President Ezra Taft Benson\
taught with great power\
3:09\
that the Book of Mormon, the\
keystone of our religion,\
3:12\
came forth out of the earth\
in fulfillment of the Lord's\
3:16\
pronouncement to Enoch.\
3:18\
The Father and the Son\
and angels and prophets\
3:22\
appearing to the\
Prophet Joseph Smith\
3:24\
were "directed by heaven to\
restore the necessary powers\
3:29\
to the kingdom."\
3:31\
The Prophet Joseph Smith\
received revelation\
3:33\
after revelation.\
3:35\
Some have been addressed\
during this conference.\
3:38\
Many revelations received\
by the Prophet Joseph\
3:41\
have been preserved for us in\
the Doctrine and Covenants.\
3:44\
All the standard\
works of the Church\
3:47\
contain the mind and\
will of the Lord for us\
3:50\
in this last dispensation.\
3:53\
In addition to these great\
foundational scriptures,\
3:57\
we are blessed with continuing\
revelation to living prophets.\
4:01\
Prophets are "commissioned\
agents of the Lord, authorized\
4:06\
to speak for Him."\
4:08\
Some revelations are of\
monumental importance,\
4:11\
and others enhance\
our understanding\
4:13\
of essential divine truths and\
provide guidance for our day.\
4:18\
We are incredibly grateful\
for the revelation\
4:20\
to President Spencer W. Kimball\
extending priesthood and temple\
4:24\
blessings to all worthy male\
members of the Church on June\
4:28\
8, 1978.\
4:28\
I have served with\
many of the Twelve\
4:32\
who were present\
and participated\
4:34\
when that precious\
revelation was received.\
4:37\
Each of them, in\
personal conversations,\
4:40\
confirmed the powerful and\
uniting spiritual guidance\
4:44\
President Kimball and\
they had experienced.\
4:48\
Many said it was the\
most powerful revelation\
4:51\
they had received before\
or after that time.\
4:55\
Those of us currently serving\
in the Quorum of the Twelve\
4:57\
Apostles have been\
blessed in our day\
5:00\
as significant revelations have\
come through recent prophets.\
5:04\
President Russell M. Nelson\
has been a commissioned agent\
5:09\
of the Lord, especially\
with respect to revelations,\
5:13\
to help families build\
sanctuaries of faith\
5:16\
in their homes, gather\
scattered Israel\
5:19\
on both sides of\
the veil, and bless\
5:22\
endowed members in sacred\
temple ordinance matters.\
5:27\
When important changes to\
bless our homes were announced\
5:29\
at the October 2018\
general conference,\
5:32\
I testified "that in the\
deliberations of the Council\
5:36\
of the First Presidency and\
[the] Quorum of the Twelve\
5:38\
Apostles in the temple, ...\
5:40\
after our beloved prophet\
petitioned the Lord\
5:43\
for revelation ... , a powerful\
confirmation was received\
5:47\
by all."\
5:49\
At that time, other revelations\
relating to sacred temple\
5:52\
ordinances had been received but\
not announced or implemented.\
5:57\
This guidance commenced with\
individual prophetic revelation\
6:02\
to President Russell\
M. Nelson and tender\
6:05\
and powerful\
confirmation to those\
6:08\
participating in the process.\
6:10\
President Nelson specifically\
involved the sisters\
6:14\
who preside over the Relief\
Society, the Young Women,\
6:17\
and Primary organizations.\
6:19\
The final guidance, in the\
temple, to the First Presidency\
6:23\
and Quorum of the\
Twelve Apostles\
6:25\
was profoundly\
spiritual and powerful.\
6:27\
We each knew we had\
received the mind, will,\
6:30\
and voice of the Lord.\
6:32\
I declare with all solemnity\
that continuous revelation\
6:36\
has been received and is being\
received through channels\
6:40\
the Lord has established.\
6:42\
I testify the new proclamation\
President Nelson delivered\
6:45\
this morning is a revelation\
to bless all people.\
6:50\
We also declare our\
heartfelt desire\
6:53\
to be reunited with those\
who have been struggling\
6:55\
with their testimonies,\
been less active,\
6:58\
or have had their names\
removed from Church records.\
7:01\
We desire to feast with you\
"upon the words of Christ"\
7:05\
at the Lord's table, to learn\
the things we all should do.\
7:09\
We need you!\
7:10\
The Church needs you!\
7:12\
The Lord needs you!\
7:14\
Our heartfelt prayer\
is that you will\
7:16\
join with us in worshipping\
the Savior of the World.\
7:19\
We know that some\
of you may have\
7:21\
received unkindness or other\
conduct that is not Christlike.\
7:25\
We also know that some\
have had challenges\
7:28\
to their faith that may not be\
fully appreciated, understood,\
7:32\
or resolved.\
7:34\
Some of our most stalwart\
and faithful members\
7:37\
have suffered a challenge\
to their faith for a season.\
7:40\
I love the true account\
of W. W. Phelps, who\
7:43\
had forsaken the Church and\
testified against the Prophet\
7:47\
Joseph Smith in\
a Missouri court.\
7:49\
After repenting, he wrote to\
Joseph, "I know my situation,\
7:55\
you know it, and\
God knows it, and I\
7:58\
want to be saved if my\
friends will help me."\
8:01\
Joseph did forgive him,\
put him back to work,\
8:04\
and lovingly wrote,\
"Friends at first\
8:07\
are friends again at last."\
8:10\
Brothers and sisters,\
regardless of your situation,\
8:12\
please know that the\
Church and its members\
8:15\
will welcome you back!\
8:17\
Personal revelation is available\
to all those who humbly\
8:20\
seek guidance from the Lord.\
8:22\
It is as important as\
prophetic revelation.\
8:25\
Personal, spiritual\
revelation from the Holy Ghost\
8:29\
has resulted in\
millions receiving\
8:31\
the testimony necessary to\
be baptized and confirmed\
8:35\
members of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
8:39\
Personal revelation is\
the profound blessing\
8:41\
received following\
baptism when we\
8:44\
are "sanctified by the\
reception of the Holy Ghost."\
8:48\
I can remember a special\
spiritual revelation\
8:51\
when I was 15 years old.\
8:53\
My precious brother was\
seeking guidance from the Lord\
8:56\
as to how to respond to our\
dear father, who did not want\
8:59\
my brother to serve a mission.\
9:01\
I prayed with sincere\
intent too and received\
9:05\
personal revelation of the\
truthfulness of the gospel.\
9:09\
Personal revelation is based\
on spiritual truths received\
9:12\
from the Holy Ghost.\
9:14\
The Holy Ghost is the revealer\
and testifier of all truth,\
9:17\
especially that of the Savior.\
9:20\
Without the Holy Ghost,\
we could not really\
9:22\
know that Jesus is the Christ.\
9:24\
His seminal role\
is to bear witness\
9:27\
of the Father and the Son and\
their titles and their glory.\
9:33\
The Holy Ghost can influence\
everyone in a powerful way.\
9:36\
This influence will not be\
constant unless one is baptized\
9:41\
and receives the gift\
of the Holy Ghost.\
9:43\
The Holy Ghost serves also as a\
cleansing agent in the process\
9:47\
of repentance and forgiveness.\
9:50\
The Spirit communicates\
in marvelous ways.\
9:53\
The Lord used this\
beautiful description:\
9:56\
"I will tell you in your\
mind and in your heart,\
9:59\
by the Holy Ghost, which\
shall come upon you\
10:02\
and which shall\
dwell in your heart.\
10:05\
"Now, behold, this is the\
spirit of revelation."\
10:09\
Although its impact can\
be incredibly powerful,\
10:12\
it most often comes quietly\
as a still, small voice.\
10:16\
The scriptures\
include many examples\
10:19\
of how the Spirit\
influences our minds,\
10:21\
including speaking peace to\
our minds, occupying our minds,\
10:26\
enlightening our minds, and\
even a voice to our minds.\
10:31\
Some principles that prepare us\
to receive revelation include:\
10:35\
Praying for spiritual guidance.\
10:38\
Reverently and humbly\
we need to seek and ask\
10:41\
and be patient and submissive.\
10:44\
Preparing for inspiration.\
10:46\
This requires that\
we be in harmony\
10:49\
with the Lord's teachings\
and in compliance\
10:51\
with His commandments.\
10:54\
Partaking of the\
sacrament worthily.\
10:56\
When we do this, we witness\
and covenant with God\
10:59\
that we take upon ourselves\
the name of His Holy Son\
11:02\
and that we remember Him\
and keep His commandments.\
11:06\
These principles prepare us to\
receive, recognize, and follow\
11:11\
the prompting and guidance\
of the Holy Ghost.\
11:14\
This includes the\
"peaceable things ...\
11:17\
which bringeth joy\
[and] ... life eternal."\
11:21\
Our spiritual\
preparation is greatly\
11:23\
enhanced when we regularly\
study the scriptures\
11:26\
and truths of the gospel\
and ponder in our minds\
11:30\
the guidance we seek.\
11:31\
But remember to be patient and\
trust in the Lord's timing.\
11:36\
Guidance is given by\
an omniscient Lord\
11:39\
when He "deliberately\
chooses to school us."\
11:43\
The Holy Ghost will also provide\
revelation in our callings\
11:46\
and assignments.\
11:47\
In my experience, significant\
spiritual guidance most often\
11:52\
comes when we are trying to\
bless others in fulfilling\
11:55\
our responsibilities.\
11:57\
I can remember as a young bishop\
receiving a desperate call\
12:00\
from a married\
couple a short time\
12:02\
before I was to catch an\
airplane for a business\
12:05\
engagement.\
12:06\
I pled with the Lord\
before their arrival\
12:09\
to know how I could bless them.\
12:10\
It was revealed to me the nature\
of the problem and the response\
12:15\
I should give.\
12:16\
That revelatory\
guidance allowed me\
12:19\
to fulfill the sacred\
responsibilities of my calling\
12:21\
as bishop despite very\
limited availability of time.\
12:26\
Bishops all over the world\
also share these same kinds\
12:30\
of experiences with me.\
12:31\
As a stake president, I not only\
received important revelation\
12:36\
but also received\
personal correction\
12:39\
that was necessary to\
accomplish the Lord's purposes.\
12:43\
I assure you that\
revelatory guidance\
12:45\
can be received by\
each of us as we humbly\
12:48\
labor in the Lord's vineyard.\
12:50\
Most of our guidance\
comes from the Holy Ghost.\
12:53\
Sometimes and for\
some purposes, it\
12:57\
comes directly from the Lord.\
12:59\
I personally testify\
that this is true.\
13:02\
Guidance for the\
Church, as a whole,\
13:05\
comes to the President\
and prophet of the Church.\
13:09\
We, as modern Apostles,\
have had the privilege\
13:11\
of working and traveling with\
our current prophet, President\
13:15\
Nelson.\
13:16\
I paraphrase what Wilford\
Woodruff said about the Prophet\
13:19\
Joseph Smith; it is equally\
true of President Nelson.\
13:24\
I have seen "the workings of\
the Spirit of God with him,\
13:28\
and the revelations\
of Jesus Christ\
13:30\
unto him and the fulfillment\
of those revelations."\
13:36\
My humble plea today\
is that each of us\
13:40\
will seek continuing\
revelation to guide our lives\
13:43\
and follow the\
Spirit as we worship\
13:46\
God the Father in the\
name of our Savior, Jesus\
13:49\
Christ, of whom I bear\
witness in the name of Jesus\
13:54\
Christ, amen.\
