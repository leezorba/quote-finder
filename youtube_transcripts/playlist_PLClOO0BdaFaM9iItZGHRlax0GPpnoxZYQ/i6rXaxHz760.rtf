Sisters and brothers, what\
a wonderful time we live in.\
0:05\
As we celebrate the\
beginning of the Restoration,\
0:09\
it is also appropriate\
to celebrate\
0:11\
the ongoing Restoration\
that we are witnessing.\
0:15\
I rejoice with you\
to live in this day.\
0:18\
The Lord continues\
to put in place,\
0:21\
through His prophets, all\
that is needed to help\
0:25\
us prepare to receive Him.\
0:28\
One of those needed things\
is the new Children and Youth\
0:31\
initiative.\
0:32\
Many of you are familiar\
with this program's emphasis\
0:35\
on setting goals, new emblems of\
belonging, and For the Strength\
0:38\
of Youth conferences.\
0:40\
But we must not let\
those cloud our view\
0:43\
of the principles the program\
is built on and their purpose:\
0:48\
to help get the\
gospel of Jesus Christ\
0:51\
deep in the hearts of\
our children and youth.\
0:56\
I believe as we come to see\
these principles more clearly,\
0:59\
we will recognize this\
as more than a program\
1:02\
for members ages 8 to 18.\
1:03\
We will see how the Lord\
is trying to help us--all\
1:08\
of us--get His gospel\
deeper in our hearts.\
1:12\
I pray the Holy Ghost will\
help us as we learn together.\
1:18\
The first principle\
is relationships.\
1:20\
Because they are such a natural\
part of the Church of Jesus\
1:23\
Christ, we sometimes\
forget the importance\
1:27\
of relationships in our\
ongoing journey to Christ.\
1:30\
We are not expected to find or\
walk the covenant path alone.\
1:35\
We need love and support from\
parents, other family members,\
1:39\
friends, and leaders who\
are also walking the path.\
1:44\
These kinds of relationships\
take time--time to be together;\
1:48\
time to laugh, play,\
learn, and serve together;\
1:52\
time to appreciate each other's\
interests and challenges;\
1:56\
time to be open and honest with\
each other as we strive to be\
2:02\
better together.\
2:03\
These relationships are\
one of the primary purposes\
2:07\
of gathering as families,\
quorums, classes,\
2:10\
and congregations.\
2:12\
They are the foundation\
for effective ministering.\
2:16\
Elder Dale G. Renlund gave\
us a key to developing these\
2:19\
relationships when he said:\
"To effectively serve others we\
2:24\
must see them ... through\
Heavenly Father's eyes.\
2:27\
Only then can we\
begin to comprehend\
2:30\
the true worth of a soul.\
2:32\
Only then can we sense the\
love that Heavenly Father\
2:35\
has for all His children."\
2:38\
Seeing others as\
God does is a gift.\
2:41\
I invite all of us to\
seek for this gift.\
2:45\
As our eyes are\
opened to see, we\
2:48\
will also be able to help others\
see themselves as God does.\
2:53\
President Henry B. Eyring\
emphasized the power\
2:55\
of this when he said:\
"What will matter most\
2:59\
is what [others] learn from\
[you] about who they really are\
3:03\
and what they can really become.\
3:06\
My guess is that they won't\
learn it so much from lectures.\
3:09\
They will get it from\
feelings of who you are,\
3:13\
who you think they are, and what\
you think they might become."\
3:18\
Helping others understand\
their true identity and purpose\
3:22\
is one of the greatest\
gifts we can give.\
3:25\
Seeing others and\
ourselves as God does\
3:29\
knits our hearts "together\
in unity and in love."\
3:34\
With ever-increasing secular\
forces pulling at us,\
3:37\
we need the strength that comes\
from loving relationships.\
3:41\
So, as we plan activities,\
meetings, and other gatherings,\
3:44\
let us remember an overarching\
purpose of these gatherings\
3:49\
is to build loving\
relationships that\
3:51\
unite us and help get the\
gospel of Jesus Christ\
3:55\
deeper in our hearts.\
3:58\
Of course, it's not enough\
just to be bound together.\
4:01\
There are many groups\
and organizations\
4:03\
that achieve unity around\
a variety of causes.\
4:06\
But the unity we seek\
is to be one in Christ,\
4:10\
to connect ourselves with Him.\
4:13\
To connect our\
hearts with heaven,\
4:16\
we need individual\
spiritual experiences,\
4:19\
as Elder Andersen just\
eloquently spoke to us about.\
4:23\
Those experiences\
come as the Holy Ghost\
4:27\
carries the word and love of\
God to our mind and heart.\
4:33\
This revelation comes through\
the scriptures, especially\
4:36\
the Book of Mormon;\
through inspired\
4:39\
words of living prophets and\
other faithful disciples;\
4:43\
and through the\
still, small voice.\
4:46\
These words are more\
than ink on a page,\
4:49\
sound waves in our ears,\
thoughts in our minds,\
4:52\
or feelings in our hearts.\
4:54\
The word of God is\
spiritual power.\
4:57\
It is truth and light.\
4:59\
It is how we hear Him!\
5:02\
The word initiates and increases\
our faith in Christ and fuels\
5:08\
within us a desire to become\
more like the Savior--that,\
5:13\
is to repent and walk\
the covenant path.\
5:18\
Last April, President\
Russell M. Nelson\
5:20\
helped us understand the\
central role of repentance\
5:23\
in this revelatory journey.\
5:25\
He said, "When we choose to\
repent, we choose to change!\
5:30\
We allow the Savior to transform\
us into the best version\
5:34\
of ourselves. ...\
5:36\
We choose to become\
more like Jesus Christ!"\
5:41\
This process of change,\
fueled by the word of God,\
5:45\
is how we connect with heaven.\
5:48\
Underlying President\
Nelson's invitation to repent\
5:51\
is the principle of agency.\
5:53\
We must choose\
repentance for ourselves.\
5:57\
The gospel can't be\
forced into our hearts.\
6:00\
As Elder Renlund said,\
"Our Heavenly Father's goal\
6:03\
in parenting is not to have\
His children do what is right;\
6:07\
it is to have His children\
choose to do what is right."\
6:13\
In the programs replaced\
by Children and Youth,\
6:15\
there were over 500\
different requirements\
6:19\
to complete in order to\
receive various recognitions.\
6:23\
Today, there is essentially one.\
6:26\
It is an invitation to choose\
to become more like the Savior.\
6:31\
We do this by receiving the word\
of God through the Holy Ghost\
6:36\
and allowing Christ to\
change us into the best\
6:41\
version of ourselves.\
6:43\
This is far more than an\
exercise in goal setting\
6:46\
or self-improvement.\
6:47\
Goals are simply a tool that\
help us connect with heaven\
6:52\
through revelation, agency, and\
repentance--to come unto Christ\
6:58\
and receive His gospel\
deeper in our hearts.\
7:03\
Finally, to get the gospel\
of Jesus Christ deep\
7:06\
in our hearts, we need to\
engage in it--to give our time\
7:10\
and talents to it,\
to sacrifice for it.\
7:13\
We all want to live\
a life of meaning,\
7:16\
and this is especially true\
of the rising generation.\
7:19\
They desire a cause.\
7:22\
The gospel of Jesus Christ\
is the greatest cause\
7:25\
in the world.\
7:27\
President Ezra Taft\
Benson said: "We\
7:29\
are commanded by God to take\
this gospel to all the world.\
7:33\
That is the cause that\
must unite us today.\
7:37\
Only the gospel\
will save the world\
7:39\
from the calamity of its\
own self-destruction.\
7:42\
Only the gospel will\
unite men [and women]\
7:46\
of all races and\
nationalities in peace.\
7:48\
Only the gospel will bring\
joy, happiness, and salvation\
7:53\
to the human family."\
7:56\
Elder David A. Bednar promised,\
"As we empower the youth\
8:00\
by inviting and\
allowing them to act,\
8:03\
the Church will move\
forward in miraculous ways."\
8:07\
Too often we have not\
invited and allowed the youth\
8:10\
to sacrifice for this\
great cause of Christ.\
8:13\
Elder Neal A. Maxwell\
observed, "If [our]\
8:15\
youth are too underwhelmed\
[by God's work]\
8:18\
they are more likely to be\
overwhelmed by the world."\
8:21\
The Children and\
Youth program focuses\
8:24\
on empowering the youth.\
8:26\
They choose their own goals.\
8:28\
Quorum and class\
presidencies are\
8:30\
placed in their proper role.\
8:31\
The ward youth council,\
just like the ward council,\
8:35\
focuses on the work of\
salvation and exaltation.\
8:38\
And quorums and classes\
begin their meetings\
8:41\
by counseling about how to do\
the work God has given them.\
8:47\
President Nelson said to\
the youth of the Church:\
8:50\
"If you choose to,\
if you want to ...\
8:53\
you can be a big part of\
something big, something grand,\
8:56\
something majestic!\
8:58\
...\
8:58\
You are among the best the Lord\
has ever sent to this world.\
9:05\
You have the capacity\
to be smarter and wiser\
9:17\
and have more\
impact on the world\
9:23\
than any previous generation!"\
9:28\
On another occasion,\
President Nelson\
9:29\
told the youth: "I have\
complete confidence in you.\
9:33\
I love you, and\
so does the Lord.\
9:36\
We're His people, engaged\
together in His holy work."\
9:45\
Young people, can\
you feel the trust\
9:47\
President Nelson has in\
you and how important\
9:51\
you are to this work?\
9:54\
Parents and adult\
leaders, I invite\
9:56\
you to see the youth as\
President Nelson does.\
9:59\
As the youth feel\
your love and trust,\
10:03\
as you encourage and teach them\
how to lead--and then get out\
10:07\
of their way--they will amaze\
you with their insights,\
10:11\
abilities, and\
commitment to the gospel.\
10:15\
They will feel the\
joy of choosing\
10:18\
to engage in and sacrifice\
for the cause of Christ.\
10:23\
His gospel will get\
deeper into their hearts,\
10:26\
and the work will move\
forward in miraculous ways.\
10:31\
I promise as we focus on these\
principles--relationships,\
10:36\
revelation, agency, repentance,\
and sacrifice--the gospel\
10:42\
of Jesus Christ will sink\
deeper in all our hearts.\
10:46\
We will see the\
Restoration move forward\
10:48\
to its ultimate purpose,\
the redemption of Israel\
10:52\
and the establishment\
of Zion, where Christ\
10:55\
will reign as King of kings.\
10:57\
I testify that God\
continues to do\
11:00\
all things necessary to prepare\
His people for that day.\
11:05\
May we see His hand\
in this glorious work\
11:08\
as we all strive to\
"come unto Christ,\
11:12\
and be perfected in him."\
11:14\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
