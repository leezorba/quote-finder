Last October, President\
Russell M. Nelson\
0:06\
challenged us to consider how\
our lives would be different\
0:09\
if our "knowledge gained\
from the Book of Mormon\
0:11\
were suddenly taken away."\
0:12\
I have pondered on his question,\
as I am sure many of you have.\
0:17\
One thought has come\
again and again:\
0:20\
without the Book of Mormon and\
its clarity about the doctrine\
0:24\
of Christ and His\
atoning sacrifice,\
0:26\
where would I turn for peace?\
0:29\
The doctrine of Christ--which\
consists of the saving\
0:32\
principles and ordinances of\
faith in Christ, repentance,\
0:37\
baptism, the gift\
of the Holy Ghost,\
0:40\
and enduring to the end--is\
taught numerous times in all\
0:43\
the scriptures of the\
Restoration but with particular\
0:46\
power in the Book of Mormon.\
0:48\
The doctrine begins\
with faith in Christ,\
0:51\
and every one of its\
elements depends upon trust\
0:54\
in His atoning sacrifice.\
0:57\
As President Nelson has\
taught, "The Book of Mormon\
1:00\
provides the fullest and most\
authoritative understanding\
1:03\
of the Atonement of Jesus\
Christ to be found anywhere."\
1:09\
The more we understand about\
the Savior's supernal gift,\
1:12\
the more we will come\
to know, in our minds\
1:16\
and in our hearts, the reality\
of President Nelson's assurance\
1:20\
that "the truths of\
the Book of Mormon\
1:22\
have the power to heal, comfort,\
restore, succor, strengthen,\
1:27\
console, and cheer our souls."\
1:31\
A vital and peace-giving\
contribution\
1:33\
of the Book of Mormon to our\
understanding of the Savior's\
1:35\
Atonement is its teaching that\
Christ's merciful sacrifice\
1:39\
fulfills all the\
demands of justice.\
1:43\
As Alma explained,\
"God himself atoneth\
1:47\
for the sins of the world, to\
bring about the plan of mercy,\
1:50\
to appease the\
demands of justice,\
1:52\
that God might be a\
perfect, just God,\
1:56\
and a merciful God also."\
1:58\
The Father's plan of mercy--what\
the scriptures also call\
2:03\
the plan of happiness or the\
plan of salvation--could not be\
2:06\
accomplished unless all\
the demands of justice were\
2:10\
satisfied.\
2:12\
But what exactly are the\
"demands of justice"?\
2:15\
Consider Alma's own experience.\
2:18\
Remember that as\
a young man, Alma\
2:20\
went about seeking "to\
destroy the church."\
2:23\
In fact, Alma told\
his son Helaman\
2:26\
that he was "tormented\
with the pains of hell"\
2:28\
because he had\
effectively "murdered\
2:31\
many of [God's] children"\
by leading "them\
2:34\
away unto destruction."\
2:37\
Alma explained to Helaman that\
peace finally came to him when\
2:41\
his "mind caught hold" on his\
father's teaching "concerning\
2:45\
the coming of ...\
2:46\
Jesus Christ ... to atone\
for the sins of the world."\
2:49\
A penitent Alma pleaded\
for Christ's mercy\
2:53\
and then felt joy\
and relief when\
2:55\
he realized that Christ\
had atoned for his sins\
2:59\
and paid all that\
justice required.\
3:02\
Again, what would justice\
have required of Alma?\
3:06\
As Alma himself later\
taught, "No unclean thing can\
3:10\
inherit the kingdom of God."\
3:12\
Thus, part of Alma's\
relief must have\
3:14\
been that unless\
mercy interceded,\
3:16\
justice would have\
prevented him from returning\
3:19\
to live with Heavenly Father.\
3:21\
But was Alma's joy focused\
solely on himself--on his\
3:26\
avoiding punishment and\
his being able to return\
3:29\
to the Father?\
3:30\
We know that Alma also\
agonized about those whom\
3:33\
he had led away from the truth.\
3:35\
But Alma could not\
heal and restore\
3:39\
all those he had led away.\
3:41\
He could not himself\
ensure that they\
3:43\
would be given a\
fair opportunity\
3:45\
to learn the doctrine of Christ\
and to be blessed by living\
3:48\
its joyful principles.\
3:50\
He could not bring\
back those who\
3:52\
may have died still blinded\
by his false teaching.\
3:57\
As President Boyd K.\
Packer once taught:\
3:59\
"The thought that\
rescued Alma ... is this:\
4:03\
Restoring what you\
cannot restore,\
4:05\
healing the wound\
you cannot heal,\
4:08\
fixing that which you broke\
and you cannot fix is the very\
4:12\
purpose of the\
atonement of Christ."\
4:17\
The joyous truth on which\
Alma's mind "caught hold"\
4:20\
was not just that he\
himself could be made clean\
4:23\
but also that those\
whom he had harmed\
4:26\
could be healed and made whole.\
4:29\
Years before Alma was rescued\
by this reassuring doctrine,\
4:32\
King Benjamin had\
taught about the breadth\
4:34\
of healing offered by the\
Savior's atoning sacrifice.\
4:37\
King Benjamin declared that\
"glad tidings of great joy"\
4:41\
were given him "by\
an angel from God."\
4:43\
Among those glad\
tidings was the truth\
4:46\
that Christ would suffer and\
die for our sins and mistakes\
4:49\
to ensure that "a\
righteous judgment might\
4:54\
come upon the children of men."\
4:56\
What exactly does a\
"righteous judgment" require?\
5:00\
In the next verse,\
King Benjamin explained\
5:04\
that to ensure a righteous\
judgment, the Savior's blood\
5:07\
atoned "for the\
sins of those who\
5:09\
have fallen by the transgression\
of Adam" and "for those\
5:12\
who have died not knowing the\
will of God concerning them,\
5:16\
or who have ignorantly sinned."\
5:18\
A righteous judgment\
also required, he taught,\
5:21\
that "the blood\
of Christ atoneth\
5:23\
for" the sins of\
little children.\
5:25\
These scriptures teach\
a glorious doctrine:\
5:28\
the Savior's atoning sacrifice\
heals, as a free gift,\
5:33\
those who sin in\
ignorance--those to whom,\
5:36\
as Jacob put it, "there\
is no law given."\
5:38\
Accountability for sin depends\
on the light we have been given\
5:42\
and hinges on our ability\
to exercise our agency.\
5:46\
We know this healing and\
comforting truth only because\
5:51\
of the Book of Mormon and\
other Restoration scripture.\
5:54\
Of course, where\
there is a law given,\
5:56\
where we are not ignorant\
of the will of God,\
5:58\
we are accountable.\
6:00\
As King Benjamin\
emphasized: "Wo unto him\
6:03\
who knoweth that he\
rebelleth against God!\
6:05\
For salvation cometh\
to none such except it\
6:08\
be through repentance and faith\
on the Lord Jesus Christ."\
6:13\
This too is glad tidings\
of the doctrine of Christ.\
6:17\
Not only does the\
Savior heal and restore\
6:19\
those who sin in\
ignorance, but also,\
6:22\
for those who sin\
against the light,\
6:24\
the Savior offers healing on\
the condition of repentance\
6:27\
and faith in Him.\
6:30\
Alma must have "caught\
hold" of both these truths.\
6:34\
Would Alma truly have felt what\
he describes as "exquisite ...\
6:38\
joy" if he thought that Christ\
saved him but left forever\
6:42\
harmed those he had led\
away from the truth?\
6:44\
Surely not.\
6:46\
For Alma to feel complete\
peace, those he harmed also\
6:51\
needed the opportunity\
to be made whole.\
6:54\
But how exactly would they--or\
those we may harm--be made\
6:58\
whole?\
6:59\
Although we do not fully\
understand the sacred mechanics\
7:03\
by which the Savior's atoning\
sacrifice heals and restores,\
7:07\
we do know that to ensure\
a righteous judgment,\
7:11\
the Savior will clear away\
the underbrush of ignorance\
7:14\
and the painful thorns\
of hurt caused by others.\
7:18\
By this He assures\
that all God's children\
7:21\
will be given the opportunity,\
with unobscured vision,\
7:25\
to choose to follow\
Him and accept\
7:28\
the great plan of happiness.\
7:30\
It is these truths that would\
have brought Alma peace.\
7:34\
And it is these\
truths that should\
7:35\
bring us great peace as well.\
7:37\
As natural men and women, we\
all bump, or sometimes crash,\
7:41\
into each other and cause harm.\
7:44\
As any parent can\
testify, the pain\
7:47\
associated with our\
mistakes is not simply\
7:50\
the fear of our own\
punishment but the fear\
7:52\
that we may have limited\
our children's joy\
7:55\
or in some way hindered them\
from seeing and understanding\
7:58\
the truth.\
7:59\
The glorious promise of the\
Savior's atoning sacrifice\
8:03\
is that as far as our mistakes\
as parents are concerned,\
8:06\
He holds our children blameless\
and promises healing for them.\
8:10\
And even when they have sinned\
against the light--as we all\
8:14\
do--His arm of mercy\
is outstretched,\
8:17\
and He will redeem them if they\
will but look to Him and live.\
8:22\
Although the Savior has power\
to mend what we cannot fix,\
8:26\
He commands us to do all we\
can to make restitution as part\
8:30\
of our repentance.\
8:31\
Our sins and mistakes\
displace not only\
8:34\
our relationship\
with God but also\
8:36\
our relationships with others.\
8:38\
Sometimes our efforts\
to heal and restore\
8:42\
may be as simple as an apology,\
but other times restitution\
8:46\
may require years\
of humble effort.\
8:48\
Yet for many of our\
sins and mistakes,\
8:52\
we simply are not able to\
fully heal those we have hurt.\
8:56\
The magnificent,\
peace-giving promise\
8:59\
of the Book of Mormon\
and the restored gospel\
9:02\
is that the Savior will mend\
all that we have broken.\
9:05\
And He will also\
mend us if we turn\
9:08\
to Him in faith and repent\
of the harm we have caused.\
9:12\
He offers both of these gifts\
because He loves all of us\
9:17\
with perfect love and\
because He is committed\
9:20\
to ensuring a\
righteous judgment that\
9:23\
honors both justice and mercy.\
9:25\
I testify this is true.\
9:27\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
