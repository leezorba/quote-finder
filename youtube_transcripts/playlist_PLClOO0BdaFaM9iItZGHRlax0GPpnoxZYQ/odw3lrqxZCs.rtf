Thank you, President Eyring.\
0:05\
I have chosen to speak further\
about the priesthood of God,\
0:11\
the subject already addressed\
by three earlier speakers,\
0:17\
who taught us about how\
the priesthood blesses\
0:21\
the lives of women, young\
women, and young men.\
0:28\
The priesthood is a divine power\
and authority held in trust\
0:33\
to be used for God's work\
for the benefit of all\
0:37\
of His children.\
0:38\
Priesthood is not\
those who have been\
0:42\
ordained to a priesthood\
office or those\
0:45\
who exercise its authority.\
0:48\
Men who hold the priesthood\
are not the priesthood.\
0:52\
While we should not\
refer to ordained men\
0:55\
as "the priesthood," it is\
appropriate to refer to them\
1:00\
as holders of the priesthood.\
1:04\
The power of the priesthood\
exists both in the Church\
1:08\
and in the family organization.\
1:10\
But priesthood power\
and priesthood authority\
1:14\
function differently\
in the Church\
1:17\
than they do in the family.\
1:19\
All of this is according\
to the principles\
1:22\
the Lord has established.\
1:24\
The purpose of God's plan\
is to lead His children\
1:29\
to eternal life.\
1:31\
Mortal families are\
essential to that plan.\
1:35\
The Church exists to provide\
the doctrine, the authority,\
1:39\
and the ordinances necessary to\
perpetuate family relationships\
1:45\
into the eternities.\
1:47\
Thus, the family organization\
and the Church of Jesus Christ\
1:53\
have a mutually\
reinforcing relationship.\
1:57\
The blessings of the\
priesthood--such as the fulness\
2:01\
of the gospel and ordinances\
like baptism, confirmation,\
2:07\
and receiving the gift\
of the Holy Ghost;\
2:09\
the temple endowment; and\
eternal marriage--are available\
2:14\
to men and women alike.\
2:19\
The priesthood we speak of here\
is the Melchizedek Priesthood,\
2:22\
restored at the beginning of\
the Restoration of the gospel.\
2:26\
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery\
were ordained by Peter, James,\
2:31\
and John, who\
declared themselves\
2:34\
"as possessing the\
keys of the kingdom,\
2:37\
and of the dispensation\
of the fulness of times."\
2:42\
These senior Apostles\
received that authority\
2:45\
from the Savior Himself.\
2:47\
All other authorities or\
offices in the priesthood\
2:52\
are appendages to the\
Melchizedek Priesthood,\
2:55\
for it "holds the\
right of presidency,\
2:58\
and has power and authority over\
all the offices in the church\
3:03\
in all ages of the world."\
3:09\
In the Church the authority\
of the greater priesthood,\
3:12\
the Melchizedek\
Priesthood, and the lesser\
3:15\
or Aaronic Priesthood\
is exercised\
3:19\
under the direction of\
a priesthood leader,\
3:22\
like a bishop or\
president, who holds\
3:25\
the keys of that priesthood.\
3:27\
To understand the exercise\
of priesthood authority\
3:31\
in the Church, we must\
understand the principle\
3:35\
of priesthood keys.\
3:38\
The Melchizedek Priesthood\
keys of the kingdom\
3:41\
were conferred by\
Peter, James, and John,\
3:44\
but that did not complete the\
Restoration of priesthood keys.\
3:50\
Some keys of the\
priesthood came later.\
3:54\
Following the dedication\
of the first temple of this\
3:57\
dispensation in Kirtland, Ohio,\
three prophets--Moses, Elias,\
4:03\
and Elijah--restored "the\
keys of this dispensation,"\
4:08\
including keys pertaining\
to the gathering of Israel\
4:12\
and the work of the\
temples of the Lord,\
4:14\
as President Eyring\
has explained to us\
4:18\
so persuasively.\
4:21\
The most familiar example\
of the function of keys\
4:24\
is in the performance of\
priesthood ordinances.\
4:27\
An ordinance is a\
solemn act signifying\
4:30\
the making of covenants and\
the promising of blessings.\
4:34\
In the Church,\
all ordinances are\
4:38\
performed under\
the authorization\
4:40\
of the priesthood\
leader who holds\
4:43\
the keys for that ordinance.\
4:46\
An ordinance is most commonly\
officiated by persons\
4:50\
who have been ordained to an\
office in the priesthood acting\
4:54\
under the direction of one\
who holds priesthood keys.\
4:57\
For example, the holders of the\
various offices of the Aaronic\
5:02\
Priesthood officiate in the\
ordinance of the sacrament\
5:06\
under the keys and\
direction of the bishop, who\
5:09\
holds the keys of the\
Aaronic Priesthood.\
5:12\
The same principle applies\
to the priesthood ordinances\
5:16\
in which women\
officiate in the temple.\
5:20\
Though women do not hold an\
office in the priesthood,\
5:24\
they perform sacred\
temple ordinances\
5:27\
under the authorization\
of the president\
5:30\
of the temple, who holds\
the keys for the ordinances\
5:33\
of the temple.\
5:35\
Another example of\
priesthood authority\
5:37\
under the direction\
of one who holds\
5:39\
the keys are the\
teachings of men and women\
5:43\
called to teach the\
gospel, whether in classes\
5:47\
in their home wards or\
in the mission field.\
5:50\
Other examples are those who\
hold leadership positions\
5:54\
in the ward and exercise\
priesthood authority\
5:58\
in their leadership by\
reason of their callings\
6:01\
and under the setting\
apart and direction\
6:04\
of the priesthood leader\
who holds the keys\
6:06\
in the ward or the stake.\
6:09\
This is how the authority\
and power of the priesthood\
6:13\
is exercised and enjoyed\
in The Church of Jesus\
6:18\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
6:23\
Priesthood authority\
is also exercised\
6:26\
and its blessings\
realized in the families\
6:30\
of Latter-day Saints.\
6:31\
By families I mean a\
priesthood-holding man\
6:35\
and a woman who are\
married and their children.\
6:38\
I also include the variations\
from the ideal relationships\
6:43\
such as caused by\
death or divorce.\
6:47\
The principle that priesthood\
authority can be exercised only\
6:51\
under the direction\
of the one who\
6:53\
holds the keys for that function\
is fundamental in the Church,\
6:59\
but this does not\
apply in the family.\
7:03\
For example, a father\
presides and exercises\
7:07\
the priesthood in his\
family by the authority\
7:11\
of the priesthood he holds.\
7:13\
He has no need to have\
the direction or approval\
7:16\
of one holding priesthood\
keys in order to perform\
7:20\
his various family functions.\
7:23\
These include counseling\
the members of his family,\
7:26\
holding family meetings,\
giving priesthood blessings\
7:29\
to his wife and children,\
or giving healing blessings\
7:33\
to family members or others.\
7:35\
Church authorities\
teach family members\
7:39\
but do not direct the exercise\
of priesthood authority\
7:43\
in the family.\
7:46\
The same principle applies\
when a father is absent\
7:48\
and a mother is\
the family leader.\
7:51\
She presides in her home and\
is instrumental in bringing\
7:55\
the power and blessings of\
the priesthood into her family\
7:59\
through her endowment and\
sealing in the temple.\
8:03\
While she is not authorized to\
give the priesthood blessings\
8:07\
that can only be given\
by a person holding\
8:10\
a certain office\
in the priesthood,\
8:13\
she can perform all of the other\
functions of family leadership.\
8:18\
In doing so she exercises\
the power of the priesthood\
8:23\
for the benefit of\
the children over whom\
8:26\
she presides in her position\
of leadership in the family.\
8:33\
If fathers would magnify their\
priesthood in their own family,\
8:37\
it would further the mission of\
the Church as much as anything\
8:41\
else they might do.\
8:42\
Fathers who hold the Melchizedek\
Priesthood should exercise\
8:47\
their authority "by\
persuasion, by long-suffering,\
8:51\
by gentleness and meekness,\
and by love unfeigned."\
8:55\
That high standard\
for the exercise\
8:58\
of all priesthood authority is\
most important in the family.\
9:03\
Holders of the priesthood should\
also keep the commandments\
9:07\
so they will have the\
power of the priesthood\
9:10\
to give blessings to\
their family members.\
9:13\
They should cultivate\
loving family relationships\
9:17\
so that family members will\
want to ask them for blessings.\
9:22\
And parents should encourage\
more priesthood blessings\
9:26\
in the family.\
9:30\
In these conference meetings,\
as we seek brief shelter\
9:34\
from our mortal concerns\
with a devastating pandemic,\
9:39\
we have been taught great\
principles of eternity.\
9:43\
I encourage each of us\
to have our eye "single"\
9:48\
to receive these\
truths of eternity\
9:51\
so that our bodies\
"shall be full of light."\
9:55\
In His sermon to multitudes\
recorded in the Bible\
9:59\
and in the Book of\
Mormon, the Savior\
10:01\
taught that mortal bodies\
can be full of light or full\
10:06\
of darkness.\
10:08\
We, of course, want to\
be filled with light,\
10:11\
and our Savior taught us\
how we can make this happen.\
10:15\
We should listen to messages\
about the truths of eternity.\
10:20\
He used the example of our eye,\
through which we take light\
10:26\
into our bodies.\
10:28\
If our eye "be\
single"--in other words,\
10:31\
if we are concentrating\
on receiving eternal light\
10:34\
and understanding--He explained,\
"thy whole body shall be full\
10:39\
of light."\
10:41\
But if our "eye\
be evil"--that is,\
10:44\
if we look for evil and take\
that into our bodies--He\
10:48\
warned, "thy whole body\
shall be full of darkness."\
10:53\
In other words, the light or\
darkness in our bodies depends\
10:58\
on how we see--or receive--the\
eternal truths we are taught.\
11:06\
We should follow the\
Savior's invitation\
11:08\
to seek and ask to understand\
the truths of eternity.\
11:13\
He promises that\
our Father in Heaven\
11:16\
is willing to teach everyone\
the truths they seek.\
11:20\
If we desire this and have\
our eye single to receive,\
11:26\
the Savior promises that\
the truths of eternity\
11:30\
"shall be opened" unto us.\
11:35\
In contrast, Satan is anxious\
to confuse our thinking\
11:38\
or to lead us astray\
on important matters\
11:42\
like the operations of\
the priesthood of God.\
11:45\
The Savior warned of\
such "false prophets, who\
11:49\
come to you in sheep's\
clothing, but inwardly they\
11:52\
are ravening wolves."\
11:55\
He gave us this test\
to help us choose\
11:58\
the truth from among\
different teachings that\
12:01\
might confuse us.\
12:03\
"Ye shall know them by\
their fruits," He taught.\
12:08\
"A good tree cannot\
bring forth evil fruit,\
12:11\
neither [can] a corrupt tree\
bring forth good fruit."\
12:15\
Therefore, we should look to\
the results--"the fruits"--of\
12:20\
principles that are taught and\
the persons who teach them.\
12:25\
That is the best answer\
to many of the objections\
12:29\
we hear against the\
Church and its doctrines\
12:32\
and policies and leadership.\
12:34\
Follow the test\
the Savior taught.\
12:36\
Look to the fruits--the results.\
12:42\
When we think of the\
fruits of the gospel\
12:44\
and the restored\
Church of Jesus Christ,\
12:47\
we rejoice in how the Church,\
in the lifetimes of its living\
12:52\
members, has expanded\
from local congregations\
12:56\
in the Intermountain\
West to where\
12:59\
a majority of its more\
than 16 million members\
13:02\
reside in nations other\
than the United States.\
13:06\
With that growth we\
have felt increases\
13:10\
in the Church's capacity\
to assist its members.\
13:13\
We assist in keeping\
the commandments,\
13:17\
in fulfilling responsibilities\
to preach the restored gospel,\
13:21\
in gathering Israel,\
and in building temples\
13:24\
throughout the world.\
13:26\
We are led by a prophet,\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
13:30\
whose leadership\
the Lord has used\
13:33\
to achieve the\
progress we have felt\
13:36\
during all of the more than\
two years of his leadership.\
13:39\
Now we will be blessed to hear\
from President Nelson, who\
13:44\
will teach us how to further\
our progress in this restored\
13:48\
Church of Jesus Christ in\
these challenging times.\
13:54\
I testify of the\
truth of these things\
13:57\
and join you in praying for our\
prophet, from whom we will next\
14:01\
hear, in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
