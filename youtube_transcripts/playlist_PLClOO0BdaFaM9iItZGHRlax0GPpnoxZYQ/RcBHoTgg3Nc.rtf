Thank you very much, President,\
for such a wonderful opening.\
0:06\
Brothers and sisters, two\
hundred fifteen years ago,\
0:09\
a little boy was born to Joseph\
and Lucy Mack Smith in Vermont\
0:16\
in a region known as New England\
in the northeastern United\
0:20\
States.\
0:21\
Joseph and Lucy Mack\
believed in Jesus Christ,\
0:25\
studied the holy\
scriptures, sincerely\
0:28\
prayed, and walked\
with faith in God.\
0:32\
They named their new\
baby son Joseph Smith Jr.\
0:37\
Of the Smith family,\
Brigham Young\
0:39\
said: "The Lord had his\
eye upon [Joseph Smith],\
0:43\
and upon his father, and\
upon his father's father,\
0:47\
and upon their\
progenitors clear back\
0:50\
to Abraham, and from\
Abraham to the flood,\
0:54\
from the flood to Enoch\
and from Enoch to Adam.\
0:57\
He has watched that\
family and that blood\
1:00\
as it has circulated\
from its fountain\
1:03\
to the birth of that man.\
1:06\
[Joseph Smith] was\
foreordained in eternity."\
1:11\
Beloved by his\
family, Joseph Jr.\
1:13\
was particularly close\
to his older brother\
1:17\
Hyrum, who was six years of\
age when Joseph was born.\
1:22\
Last October, I sat\
by the hearthstone\
1:25\
that was in the small Smith\
home in Sharon, Vermont,\
1:30\
where Joseph was born.\
1:32\
I felt Hyrum's love\
for Joseph and thought\
1:35\
of him holding his baby\
brother in his arms\
1:38\
and teaching him how to walk.\
1:42\
Father and Mother Smith\
experienced personal setbacks,\
1:46\
forcing them to move their\
family numerous times\
1:49\
before finally giving\
up on New England\
1:53\
and making the courageous\
decision to move\
1:56\
farther west in New York state.\
2:00\
Because the family was united,\
they survived these challenges\
2:04\
and together faced\
the daunting task\
2:07\
of starting over again on\
a hundred-acre wooded tract\
2:12\
of land in Manchester,\
near Palmyra, New York.\
2:17\
I am not sure that many\
of us realize the physical\
2:21\
and emotional challenges\
that starting over presented\
2:24\
the Smith family--clearing land,\
planting orchards and fields,\
2:29\
building a small log home\
and other farm structures,\
2:34\
hiring out as day laborers,\
and making home goods to sell\
2:38\
in town.\
2:40\
By the time the family\
arrived in western New York,\
2:44\
the area was ablaze with\
religious fervor--known\
2:47\
as the Second Great Awakening.\
2:51\
During this time of debate and\
strife among religious parties,\
2:56\
Joseph experienced\
a wondrous vision.\
2:59\
Known today as the\
First Vision, we\
3:02\
are blessed to have four\
primary accounts from which I\
3:07\
will draw.\
3:08\
Joseph recorded, "During this\
time of great [religious]\
3:12\
excitement my mind was called\
up to serious reflection\
3:17\
and great uneasiness; but though\
my feelings were deep and often\
3:23\
poignant, still I kept myself\
aloof from all these parties,\
3:29\
though I attended their several\
meetings as often as occasion\
3:33\
would permit.\
3:34\
...\
3:35\
[Yet] so great were the\
confusion and strife\
3:38\
among the different\
denominations,\
3:40\
that it was impossible\
for a person young\
3:44\
as I was, and so unacquainted\
with men and things,\
3:48\
to come to any certain\
conclusion who was right\
3:52\
and who was wrong."\
3:56\
Joseph turned to the Bible to\
find answers to his questions\
4:01\
and read James 1:5: "If\
any of you lack wisdom,\
4:06\
let him ask of God, that\
giveth to all men liberally,\
4:10\
and upbraideth not; and\
it shall be given him."\
4:15\
He noted, "Never did\
any passage of scripture\
4:19\
come with more power\
to the heart of man\
4:22\
than this did at\
this time to mine.\
4:26\
It seemed to enter\
with great force\
4:29\
into every feeling of my heart.\
4:32\
I reflected on it\
again and again."\
4:36\
Joseph came to realize\
that the Bible did not\
4:39\
contain all the answers\
to life's questions;\
4:42\
rather, it taught men and women\
how they could find answers\
4:47\
to their questions by\
communicating directly\
4:50\
with God through prayer.\
4:53\
He added, "So, in accordance\
with this, my determination\
4:58\
to ask of God, I retired to\
the woods to make the attempt.\
5:02\
It was on the morning of\
a beautiful, clear day,\
5:07\
early in the spring of\
eighteen hundred and twenty."\
5:12\
Soon thereafter, Joseph said\
that "[a pillar of] light\
5:16\
rested upon me [and]\
I saw two Personages,\
5:21\
whose brightness and glory\
defy all description,\
5:24\
standing above me in the air.\
5:27\
One of them spake unto me,\
calling me by name and said,\
5:31\
pointing to the other--[Joseph],\
This is My Beloved Son.\
5:36\
Hear Him!"\
5:39\
THE SAVIOR THEN SPOKE:\
"Joseph, my son,\
5:43\
thy sins are forgiven thee.\
5:45\
Go thy way, walk in my statutes,\
and keep my commandments.\
5:52\
Behold, I am the Lord of glory.\
5:55\
I was crucified for the\
world, that all those who\
5:58\
believe on my name may\
have eternal life."\
6:03\
Joseph added, "No\
sooner, therefore,\
6:06\
did I get possession of myself,\
so as to be able to speak,\
6:12\
than I asked the\
Personages who stood\
6:16\
above me in the light, which\
of all the sects was right."\
6:21\
He recalled, "They told me that\
all religious denominations\
6:27\
were believing in\
incorrect doctrines,\
6:29\
and that none of them\
was acknowledged of God\
6:35\
as his church and kingdom.\
6:37\
And ... at the same time [I]\
receive[d] a promise that\
6:41\
the fulness of the gospel should\
at some future time be made\
6:46\
known unto me."\
6:49\
Joseph also noted, "I saw\
many angels in this vision."\
6:55\
Following this\
glorious vision, Joseph\
6:57\
wrote: "My soul was filled\
with love, and for many days\
7:03\
I could rejoice with great joy.\
7:05\
...\
7:05\
The Lord was with me."\
7:08\
He emerged from the Sacred\
Grove to begin his preparation\
7:13\
to become a prophet of God.\
7:17\
Joseph also began to learn\
what ancient prophets\
7:20\
experienced--rejection,\
opposition, and persecution.\
7:25\
Joseph recalled sharing\
what he had seen and heard\
7:29\
with one of the ministers\
who had been active\
7:31\
in the religious revival:\
7:35\
"I was greatly surprised\
at his behavior;\
7:39\
he treated my communication\
not only lightly,\
7:43\
but with great contempt,\
saying it was all of the devil,\
7:47\
that there were no such things\
as visions or revelations\
7:50\
in these days; that all\
such things had ceased\
7:54\
with the apostles, and\
that there would never\
7:57\
be any more of them.\
7:59\
"I soon found, however, that my\
telling the story had excited\
8:06\
a great deal of prejudice\
against me among professors\
8:10\
of religion, and was the\
cause of great persecution,\
8:15\
which continued to increase; ...\
and this was common among all\
8:20\
the sects--all united\
to persecute me."\
8:25\
Three years later,\
in 1823, the heavens\
8:28\
opened again as part\
of the continuing\
8:31\
Restoration of the gospel of\
Jesus Christ in the last days.\
8:36\
Joseph noted that an angel named\
Moroni appeared to him and said\
8:42\
"that God had a work\
for me to do ...\
8:44\
[and that] there was\
a book deposited,\
8:46\
written upon gold plates"\
that contained "the fulness\
8:50\
of the everlasting Gospel ...\
as delivered by the Savior\
8:54\
to the ancient inhabitants\
[of the Americas]."\
8:59\
Eventually, Joseph\
obtained, translated,\
9:02\
and published the ancient\
record, known today\
9:06\
as the Book of Mormon.\
9:09\
His brother Hyrum, who had\
been his constant supporter,\
9:12\
especially following his\
painful and life-threatening leg\
9:16\
operation in 1813, was\
one of the witnesses\
9:21\
of the gold plates.\
9:22\
He was also one\
of the six members\
9:25\
of the Church of Jesus Christ\
when it was organized in 1830.\
9:29\
During their lives,\
Joseph and Hyrum\
9:34\
faced mobs and\
persecution together.\
9:37\
For example, they languished\
in the most wretched conditions\
9:42\
in the Liberty Jail in\
Missouri for five months\
9:46\
during the cold\
winter of 1838-39.\
9:48\
In April 1839, Joseph\
wrote his wife Emma\
9:56\
describing their\
situation in Liberty Jail:\
10:01\
"I believe it is now about\
five months and six days\
10:06\
since I have been under the\
grimace of a guard, night\
10:11\
and day, and within the walls,\
grates, and screeching iron\
10:16\
doors of a lonesome,\
dark, dirty prison.\
10:19\
...\
10:20\
We shall be moved from\
this [place] at any rate,\
10:24\
and we are glad of it.\
10:26\
Let what will become of us, we\
cannot get into a worse hole\
10:32\
than this is. ...\
10:33\
We shall never cast a\
lingering wish after Liberty\
10:37\
in Clay County, Missouri.\
10:39\
We have enough of\
it to last forever."\
10:44\
In the face of\
persecution, Hyrum\
10:47\
exhibited faith in\
the Lord's promises,\
10:49\
including a guarantee to escape\
his enemies if he so chose.\
10:57\
In a blessing Hyrum\
received in 1835\
10:59\
under the hands of\
Joseph Smith, the Lord\
11:04\
promised him: "Thou shalt\
have power to escape\
11:08\
the hand of thine enemies.\
11:10\
Thy life shall be sought with\
untiring zeal, but thou shalt\
11:15\
escape.\
11:16\
If it please thee,\
and thou desirest,\
11:19\
thou shalt have the power\
voluntarily to lay down\
11:24\
thy life to glorify God."\
11:28\
In June 1844, Hyrum was\
presented the choice to live\
11:35\
or to lay down his life to\
glorify God and to "seal his\
11:40\
testimony with his blood"--side\
by side together with his\
11:45\
beloved brother Joseph.\
11:48\
A week before the\
fateful trip to Carthage,\
11:52\
where they were\
murdered in cold blood\
11:55\
by an armed mob of\
cowards who had painted\
11:58\
their faces to avoid\
detection, Joseph\
12:02\
recorded that "I\
advised my brother Hyrum\
12:06\
to take his family\
on the next steamboat\
12:08\
and go to Cincinnati."\
12:12\
I still feel great emotion\
as I remember Hyrum's reply:\
12:18\
"Joseph, I can't leave you."\
12:22\
So Joseph and Hyrum\
went to Carthage,\
12:26\
where they became martyrs\
for Christ's cause and name.\
12:31\
The official announcement of the\
martyrdom stated the following:\
12:36\
"Joseph Smith, the Prophet\
and Seer of the Lord, ...\
12:40\
has brought forth\
the Book of Mormon,\
12:43\
which he translated by\
the gift and power of God,\
12:47\
and has been the means\
of publishing it on two\
12:50\
continents; has sent the fulness\
of the everlasting gospel,\
12:55\
which it contained, to the\
four quarters of the earth;\
13:00\
has brought forth the\
revelations and commandments\
13:04\
which compose this book\
of Doctrine and Covenants,\
13:08\
and many other wise\
documents and instructions\
13:12\
for the benefit of\
the children of men;\
13:15\
gathered many thousands\
of the Latter-day Saints,\
13:18\
founded a great city, and left\
a fame and name that cannot be\
13:24\
slain.\
13:25\
...\
13:25\
And like most of the Lord's\
anointed in ancient times,\
13:29\
[Joseph] has sealed his\
mission and his works\
13:33\
with his own blood; and\
so has his brother Hyrum.\
13:38\
In life they were not\
divided, and in death they\
13:42\
were not separated!"\
13:45\
Following the martyrdom,\
Joseph's and Hyrum's bodies\
13:49\
were returned to Nauvoo, washed,\
and dressed so the Smith family\
13:54\
could see their loved ones.\
13:57\
Their precious mother recalled:\
"I had for a long time braced\
14:03\
every nerve, roused\
every energy of my soul,\
14:07\
and called upon God\
to strengthen me;\
14:10\
but when I entered the room, and\
saw my murdered sons extended\
14:16\
both at once before my eyes,\
and heard the sobs and groans\
14:23\
of my family [and] the cries ...\
from the lips of their wives,\
14:28\
children, brothers, and\
sisters, it was too much.\
14:32\
I sank back crying to the\
Lord in the agony of my soul,\
14:38\
'My God!\
14:39\
My God!\
14:40\
Why hast thou forsaken\
this family?'"\
14:45\
At that moment of\
sorrow and distress,\
14:48\
she recalled them\
saying, "Mother,\
14:51\
weep not for us; we have\
overcome the world by love."\
14:56\
They had indeed\
overcome the world.\
15:02\
Joseph and Hyrum Smith, like\
those faithful Saints described\
15:07\
in the book of Revelation,\
"came out of great tribulation,\
15:13\
and have washed their robes,\
and made them white in the blood\
15:17\
of the Lamb [and] are ...\
before the throne of God,\
15:21\
and serve him day and\
night in his temple:\
15:25\
and he that sitteth on the\
throne shall dwell among them.\
15:29\
"They shall hunger no more,\
neither thirst any more;\
15:33\
neither shall the sun light\
on them, nor any heat.\
15:38\
"For the Lamb which is in\
the midst of the throne\
15:41\
shall feed them, and shall\
lead them unto living fountains\
15:46\
of waters: and God shall\
wipe away all tears\
15:50\
from their eyes."\
15:53\
As we celebrate this joyous\
occasion, the 200th anniversary\
15:58\
of the First Vision,\
we should always\
16:01\
remember the price Joseph\
and Hyrum Smith paid,\
16:06\
along with so many other\
faithful men and women\
16:10\
and children, to establish the\
Church so you and I could enjoy\
16:18\
the many blessings and all\
of these revealed truths\
16:22\
that we have today.\
16:24\
Their faithfulness should\
never be forgotten!\
16:29\
I have often wondered why Joseph\
and Hyrum and their families\
16:32\
had to suffer so much.\
16:34\
It may be that they came to\
know God through their suffering\
16:39\
in ways that could not\
have happened without it.\
16:43\
Through it, they\
reflected on Gethsemane\
16:48\
and the cross of the Savior.\
16:50\
As Paul said, "For\
unto you it is\
16:53\
given in the behalf of Christ,\
not only to believe on him,\
16:58\
but also to suffer\
for his sake."\
17:02\
Before his death in 1844,\
Joseph wrote a spirited letter\
17:06\
to the Saints.\
17:07\
It was a call to action, which\
continues in the Church today:\
17:13\
"Brethren [and\
sisters], shall we not\
17:17\
go on in so great a cause?\
17:19\
Go forward and not backward.\
17:21\
Courage, brethren [and sisters];\
and on, on to the victory!\
17:26\
...\
17:26\
"...\
17:27\
Let us, therefore, as\
a church and a people,\
17:30\
and as Latter-day Saints,\
offer unto the Lord\
17:33\
an offering in righteousness."\
17:37\
As we listen to the Spirit\
during this 200th anniversary\
17:41\
celebration this\
weekend, consider\
17:44\
what offering you will\
present to the Lord\
17:47\
in righteousness\
in the coming days.\
17:50\
Be courageous--share it\
with someone you trust,\
17:53\
and most importantly, please\
take the time to do it!\
17:58\
I know that the\
Savior is pleased\
18:01\
when we present Him an\
offering from our hearts\
18:05\
in righteousness,\
just as He was pleased\
18:08\
with the faithful offering\
of those remarkable brothers,\
18:12\
Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and\
all other faithful Saints.\
18:17\
Of this I solemnly testify\
in the sacred and holy name\
18:25\
of our Lord, Jesus Christ, amen.\
