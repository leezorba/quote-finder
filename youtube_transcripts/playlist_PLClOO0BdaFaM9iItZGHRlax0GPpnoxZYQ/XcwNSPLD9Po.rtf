President Nelson, thank you\
for this wonderful general\
0:06\
conference.\
0:07\
I've already now printed the\
proclamation in four languages.\
0:13\
These are the languages our\
children served their missions\
0:16\
in.\
0:16\
So it's a wonderful thing.\
0:18\
Thank you again.\
0:19\
We love you; we sustain you.\
0:23\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
my dear friends, each week,\
0:27\
members of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
0:31\
all around the globe worship\
our beloved Heavenly Father,\
0:35\
the God and King of the\
universe, and His Beloved Son,\
0:40\
Jesus Christ.\
0:42\
We ponder the life and teachings\
of Jesus Christ--the only\
0:47\
sinless soul who ever lived,\
the spotless Lamb of God.\
0:53\
As often as we partake of\
the sacrament in remembrance\
0:58\
of His sacrifice and\
recognize that He\
1:01\
is the center in\
our lives, we feel\
1:04\
we love Him and we honor Him.\
1:07\
Because of His profound\
and eternal love,\
1:10\
Jesus Christ suffered\
and died for you and me.\
1:15\
He broke open the\
gates of death,\
1:18\
shattered the barriers\
that separated friends\
1:21\
and loved ones, and brought\
hope to the hopeless,\
1:25\
healing to the sick, and\
deliverance to the captive.\
1:31\
To Him we dedicate\
our hearts, our lives,\
1:35\
and our daily devotion.\
1:37\
For this reason, "we talk of\
Christ, we rejoice in Christ,\
1:42\
[and] we preach of Christ ...\
that our children may know\
1:45\
to what source they may look\
for a remission of their sins."\
1:51\
However, being a\
disciple of Jesus Christ\
1:54\
involves much more than talking\
and preaching of Christ.\
1:58\
The Savior Himself\
restored His Church\
2:02\
to help us on the path\
to become more like Him.\
2:07\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints\
2:10\
is structured to\
provide opportunities\
2:14\
to practice the fundamentals\
of discipleship.\
2:19\
Through our participation\
in the Church,\
2:22\
we learn to recognize\
and act on the promptings\
2:27\
of the Holy Spirit.\
2:28\
We develop the disposition\
of reaching out in compassion\
2:32\
and kindness to others.\
2:35\
This is an effort of a lifetime,\
and it requires practice.\
2:40\
Accomplished athletes\
spend countless hours\
2:44\
practicing the fundamentals\
of their sports.\
2:47\
Nurses, networkers,\
nuclear engineers,\
2:50\
and even I as a competitive\
hobby cook in Harriet's kitchen\
2:55\
become capable only and\
skilled only as we diligently\
3:01\
practice our craft.\
3:04\
As an airline captain, I often\
trained pilots using a flight\
3:07\
simulator--a sophisticated\
machine that replicates\
3:12\
the flying experience.\
3:14\
The simulator not only helps\
pilots learn the fundamentals\
3:17\
of flying, it also allows\
them to experience and react\
3:22\
to unexpected events they\
could encounter when they take\
3:28\
command of the real aircraft.\
3:30\
The same principles apply for\
disciples of Jesus Christ.\
3:35\
Actively participating in\
the Church of Jesus Christ\
3:39\
and its great variety\
of opportunities\
3:42\
will help us to be better\
prepared for life's changing\
3:47\
circumstances, whatever and\
how serious they may be.\
3:52\
As members of the Church, we are\
encouraged to immerse ourselves\
3:57\
in the words of God through His\
prophets, ancient and modern.\
4:02\
Through sincere and humble\
prayer to our Heavenly Father,\
4:06\
we learn to recognize the\
voice of the Holy Spirit.\
4:11\
We accept calls to serve, teach,\
plan, minister, and administer.\
4:16\
These opportunities\
allow us to grow in\
4:20\
spirit, mind, and character.\
4:24\
They will help us\
prepare to make and keep\
4:27\
sacred covenants that\
will bless us in this life\
4:32\
and in the life to come.\
4:35\
We invite all of God's\
children throughout the world\
4:38\
to join us in this\
great endeavor.\
4:41\
Come and see!\
4:43\
Even during this challenging\
time of coronavirus,\
4:48\
meet with us online.\
4:50\
Meet with our\
missionaries online.\
4:53\
Find out for yourselves what\
this Church is all about!\
4:59\
When this difficult\
time has passed,\
5:01\
meet with us in our homes\
and in our worship places!\
5:06\
We invite you to come and help!\
5:08\
Come and serve with us,\
ministering to God's children,\
5:13\
following in the\
footsteps of the Savior,\
5:16\
and making this\
world a better place.\
5:20\
Come and belong!\
5:21\
You will make us stronger.\
5:24\
And you will become better,\
kinder, and happier as well.\
5:28\
Your faith will deepen and grow\
more resilient--more capable\
5:33\
of withstanding the turbulences\
and unexpected trials of life.\
5:39\
And how do we start?\
5:41\
There are many possible ways.\
5:45\
We invite you to read\
the Book of Mormon.\
5:48\
If you don't have\
a copy, you can\
5:50\
read it on\
ChurchofJesusChrist.org\
5:54\
or download the\
Book of Mormon app.\
5:57\
The Book of Mormon is another\
testament of Jesus Christ\
6:02\
and a companion to the\
Old and New Testaments.\
6:07\
We love all of these holy\
scriptures and learn from them.\
6:12\
We invite you to spend some\
time at ComeUntoChrist.org\
6:17\
to find out what members of\
the Church teach and believe.\
6:21\
Invite the missionaries\
to visit with you online\
6:24\
or in the privacy of your\
home when and where this\
6:28\
is possible.\
6:30\
They have a message\
of hope and healing.\
6:34\
These missionaries are our\
precious sons and daughters\
6:38\
who serve in many places around\
the world on their own time\
6:42\
and money.\
6:44\
In the Church of\
Jesus Christ, you\
6:45\
will find a family of people who\
are not so different from you.\
6:49\
You will find people who need\
your help and who want to help\
6:53\
you as you strive to become the\
best version of yourself--the\
6:59\
person God created\
you to become.\
7:04\
You might be thinking, "I\
have made mistakes in my life.\
7:08\
I'm not sure I could\
ever feel like I belong\
7:12\
in the Church of Jesus Christ.\
7:14\
God couldn't be interested\
in someone like me."\
7:19\
Jesus the Christ, though\
He is the "King of kings,"\
7:23\
the Messiah, "the Son\
of the living God,"\
7:25\
does care deeply about each and\
every one of God's children.\
7:32\
He cares regardless of a\
person's position--how poor\
7:35\
or rich, how imperfect\
or proven someone is.\
7:40\
During His mortal\
life, the Savior\
7:44\
ministered to all: to the\
happy and accomplished,\
7:48\
to the broken and lost,\
and to those without hope.\
7:53\
Often, the people He\
served and ministered to\
7:57\
were not individuals of\
prominence, beauty, or wealth.\
8:00\
Often, the people He\
lifted up had little\
8:03\
to offer in return but\
gratitude, a humble heart,\
8:08\
and the desire to have faith.\
8:11\
If Jesus spent His\
mortal life ministering\
8:15\
to "the least of these,"\
would He not love them today?\
8:20\
Is there not a place\
in His Church for all\
8:23\
of God's children--even for\
those who feel unworthy,\
8:28\
forgotten, or alone?\
8:31\
There is no threshold\
of perfection\
8:33\
you must attain in order\
to qualify for God's grace.\
8:37\
Your prayers do not have\
to be loud or eloquent\
8:41\
or grammatically correct\
in order to reach heaven.\
8:46\
In truth, God does\
not show favoritism.\
8:51\
The things the world\
values mean nothing to Him.\
8:54\
He knows your heart,\
and He loves you\
8:57\
regardless of your title,\
financial net worth, or number\
9:02\
of Instagram followers.\
9:05\
As we incline our hearts\
to our Heavenly Father\
9:09\
and draw near to Him, we will\
feel Him draw near to us.\
9:16\
We are His beloved\
children--even those who reject\
9:21\
Him; even those who, like\
a headstrong, unruly child,\
9:25\
become angry with God and\
His Church, pack their bags,\
9:29\
and storm out the\
door proclaiming that\
9:34\
they're running away\
and never coming back.\
9:38\
When a child runs\
away from home,\
9:40\
he or she may not notice the\
concerned parents looking out\
9:43\
the window.\
9:44\
With tender hearts, they\
watch their son or daughter\
9:48\
go--hoping their precious child\
will learn something from this\
9:52\
heartrending experience and\
perhaps see life with new\
9:56\
eyes--and eventually\
return home.\
10:02\
So it is with our\
loving Heavenly Father.\
10:05\
He is waiting for our return.\
10:09\
Your Savior, our Savior,\
tears of love and compassion\
10:15\
in His eyes, awaits your return.\
10:19\
Even when you feel far away\
from God, He will see you;\
10:24\
He will have compassion for\
you and run to embrace you.\
10:28\
Come and belong.\
10:32\
We are pilgrims walking\
the road of mortality\
10:35\
in a grand search for\
meaning and ultimate truth.\
10:38\
Often, all we see is the path\
directly ahead--we cannot see\
10:44\
where the bends in\
the roads will lead.\
10:47\
Our loving Heavenly Father\
has not given us every answer.\
10:51\
He expects us to figure out\
many things for ourselves.\
10:56\
He expects us to believe--even\
when it's difficult to do so.\
11:01\
He expects us to straighten our\
shoulders and develop a little\
11:05\
resolve--a little backbone--and\
take another step forward.\
11:09\
That is the way\
we learn and grow.\
11:13\
Would you honestly want\
everything spelled out\
11:17\
in every detail?\
11:18\
Would you honestly want\
every question answered,\
11:22\
every destination mapped out?\
11:25\
I believe most of us would\
tire very quickly of this sort\
11:30\
of heavenly micromanagement.\
11:32\
We learn the important\
lessons of life\
11:36\
through experience, through\
learning from our mistakes,\
11:39\
through repenting and realizing\
for ourselves that "wickedness\
11:45\
never was happiness."\
11:48\
Jesus Christ, the\
Son of God, died\
11:52\
so that our mistakes might not\
condemn us and forever halt\
11:57\
our progress.\
11:59\
Because of Him, we can\
repent, and our mistakes\
12:03\
can become stepping-stones\
to greater glory.\
12:09\
You don't have to\
walk this road alone.\
12:11\
Our Heavenly Father has not\
left us to wander in darkness.\
12:16\
This is why, in\
the spring of 1820,\
12:20\
He appeared with His\
Son, Jesus Christ,\
12:23\
to a young man, Joseph Smith.\
12:26\
Think of that for a moment!\
12:28\
The God of the universe\
appeared to man!\
12:33\
This was the first\
of many encounters\
12:35\
Joseph had with God and\
other heavenly beings.\
12:38\
Many of the words these\
divine beings spoke to him\
12:42\
are recorded in the scriptures\
of The Church of Jesus\
12:45\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
12:47\
They are easily accessible.\
12:49\
Anyone can read them and learn\
for themselves the message\
12:55\
God has for us in our day.\
12:59\
We invite you to study\
them for yourself.\
13:02\
Joseph Smith was\
quite young when\
13:04\
he received these revelations.\
13:06\
Most of them came before\
he was 30 years old.\
13:09\
He lacked experience,\
and to some people,\
13:12\
he probably seemed\
underqualified to be the Lord's\
13:15\
prophet.\
13:17\
And yet the Lord\
called him anyway,\
13:20\
following a pattern we find\
throughout the holy scriptures.\
13:25\
God didn't wait to\
find a perfect person\
13:28\
to restore His gospel.\
13:30\
If He had, He would\
still be waiting.\
13:34\
Joseph was a lot\
like you and me.\
13:37\
Though he made\
mistakes, God used\
13:42\
him to accomplish\
His great purposes.\
13:46\
President Thomas S. Monson often\
repeated these words of advice:\
13:50\
"Whom the Lord calls,\
the Lord qualifies."\
13:54\
The Apostle Paul reasoned\
with the Saints in Corinth:\
13:57\
"Consider your own call,\
brothers and sisters:\
14:01\
not many of you were\
wise by human standards,\
14:05\
not many were powerful, not\
many were of noble birth."\
14:09\
God uses the weak and the plain\
to bring about His purposes.\
14:15\
The truth stands as\
a testimony that it\
14:19\
is God's power, not\
man's, that accomplishes\
14:23\
His work on the earth.\
14:27\
When God appeared\
to Joseph Smith,\
14:29\
He introduced His Son, Jesus\
Christ, and said, "Hear Him!"\
14:33\
Joseph spent the\
rest of his life\
14:36\
hearing Him and following Him.\
14:39\
As with Joseph, our\
discipleship begins\
14:43\
with our decision\
to hear and follow\
14:46\
the Savior, Jesus Christ.\
14:49\
If you desire to follow\
Him, gather your faith\
14:52\
and take upon\
yourself His cross.\
14:55\
You will find that you do\
belong in His Church--a place\
15:01\
of warmth and welcoming where\
you can join in the grand\
15:04\
pursuit of discipleship\
and happiness.\
15:08\
It is my hope that in this\
bicentennial year of the First\
15:13\
Vision, as we\
contemplate and learn\
15:16\
of the Restoration of the\
Church of Jesus Christ,\
15:20\
we will realize that it is\
not just a historical event.\
15:25\
You and I play a crucial part\
in this great, continuing story.\
15:32\
What, then, is your and my part?\
15:36\
It is to learn of Jesus\
Christ, to study His words,\
15:41\
to hear Him, and to follow\
Him by actively participating\
15:46\
in this great work.\
15:48\
I invite you to come and belong!\
15:52\
You don't have to be perfect.\
15:54\
You only have to have a\
desire to develop your faith\
15:58\
and draw nearer to Him each day.\
16:01\
Our part is to\
love and serve God\
16:04\
and to love and\
serve God's children.\
16:08\
As you do so, God will encircle\
you with His love, joy,\
16:13\
and certain guidance through\
His life and this life,\
16:18\
even under the most serious\
circumstances, and even beyond.\
16:24\
Of this I testify and leave you\
my blessing in deep gratitude\
16:29\
and love for each one of you, in\
the sacred name of our Savior,\
16:34\
our Master, in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
