My beloved brothers\
and sisters, I\
0:04\
am grateful to be with you\
in this general conference\
0:07\
of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
0:11\
In his invitation to reflect on\
the way the Lord's Restoration\
0:17\
of His Church in this last\
dispensation has blessed us\
0:22\
and our loved ones,\
President Russell M. Nelson\
0:25\
promised that our\
experience would be not only\
0:28\
memorable but unforgettable.\
0:31\
My experience has\
been memorable,\
0:34\
as I am sure yours has been.\
0:36\
Whether it will be unforgettable\
depends on each one of us.\
0:41\
That matters to me\
because the experience\
0:45\
of preparing for this conference\
has changed me in a way\
0:50\
that I want to last.\
0:52\
Let me explain.\
0:55\
My preparation took me\
to the record of an event\
0:58\
in the Restoration.\
1:00\
I had read about that\
event many times,\
1:03\
but it had always been to me a\
report of an important meeting\
1:08\
that involved Joseph Smith,\
the prophet of the Restoration.\
1:12\
But this time, I\
saw in the account\
1:16\
how the Lord leads us, His\
disciples, in His Church.\
1:21\
I saw what it means for us\
mortals to be led by the Savior\
1:26\
of the world, the Creator--who\
knows all things, past,\
1:31\
present, and future.\
1:34\
He teaches us step-by-step\
and guides us, never forcing.\
1:41\
The meeting I'm describing\
was a pivotal moment\
1:44\
in the Restoration.\
1:46\
It was a Sabbath day.\
1:47\
It was a meeting held on\
April 3, 1836, in the Kirtland\
1:52\
Temple, in Ohio, seven days\
after it was dedicated.\
1:57\
Joseph Smith described\
this great moment\
2:00\
in the history of the\
world in a simple way.\
2:04\
Much of his account is recorded\
in Doctrine and Covenants\
2:09\
section 110:\
2:13\
"In the afternoon, I\
assisted the other Presidents\
2:17\
in distributing the Lord's\
Supper to the Church,\
2:20\
receiving it from the\
Twelve, whose privilege\
2:24\
it was to officiate at\
the sacred desk this day.\
2:29\
After having performed this\
service to my brethren,\
2:32\
I retired to the pulpit,\
the veils being dropped,\
2:37\
and bowed myself,\
with Oliver Cowdery,\
2:39\
in solemn and silent prayer.\
2:43\
After rising from prayer,\
the following vision\
2:47\
was opened to both of us."\
2:50\
"The veil was taken\
from our minds,\
2:53\
and the eyes of our\
understanding were opened.\
2:56\
"We saw the Lord standing upon\
the breastwork of the pulpit,\
3:02\
before us; and under his feet\
was a paved work of pure gold,\
3:07\
in color like amber.\
3:10\
"His eyes were as a flame of\
fire; the hair of his head\
3:13\
was white like the pure\
snow; his countenance\
3:16\
shone above the\
brightness of the sun;\
3:18\
and his voice was as the sound\
of the rushing of great waters,\
3:23\
even the voice of\
Jehovah, saying:\
3:26\
"I am the first and the\
last; I am he who liveth,\
3:29\
I am he who was slain; I am\
your advocate with the Father.\
3:35\
"Behold, your sins\
are forgiven you;\
3:37\
you are clean before\
me; therefore,\
3:40\
lift up your heads and rejoice.\
3:43\
"Let the hearts of\
your brethren rejoice,\
3:45\
and let the hearts\
of all my people\
3:47\
rejoice, who have,\
with their might,\
3:50\
built this house to my name.\
3:52\
" ...\
3:53\
Behold, I have\
accepted this house,\
3:56\
and my name shall be here;\
and I will manifest myself\
4:01\
to my people in\
mercy in this house.\
4:04\
"Yea, I will appear\
unto my servants,\
4:07\
and speak unto them\
with mine own voice,\
4:10\
if my people will\
keep my commandments,\
4:13\
and do not pollute\
this holy house.\
4:16\
"Yea the hearts of thousands\
and tens of thousands\
4:20\
shall greatly rejoice\
in consequence\
4:23\
of the blessings which\
shall be poured out,\
4:26\
and the endowment with\
which my servants have\
4:29\
been endowed in this house.\
4:31\
"And the fame of this house\
shall spread to foreign lands;\
4:35\
and this is the beginning\
of the blessing which\
4:37\
shall be poured out upon\
the heads of my people.\
4:40\
Even so.\
4:41\
Amen.\
4:44\
"After this vision\
closed, the heavens\
4:47\
were again opened unto us;\
and Moses appeared before us,\
4:51\
and committed unto us the keys\
of the gathering of Israel\
4:55\
from the four\
parts of the earth,\
4:56\
and the leading\
of the ten tribes\
4:58\
from the land of the north.\
5:00\
"After this, Elias appeared,\
and committed the dispensation\
5:04\
of the gospel of Abraham,\
saying that in us\
5:07\
and our seed all generations\
after us should be blessed.\
5:11\
"After this vision had closed,\
another great and glorious\
5:14\
vision burst upon us; for\
Elijah the prophet, who\
5:18\
was taken to heaven without\
tasting death, stood before us,\
5:22\
and said:\
5:23\
"Behold, the time\
has fully come,\
5:27\
which was spoken of by the mouth\
of Malachi--testifying that he\
5:31\
[Elijah] should be sent, before\
the great and dreadful day\
5:35\
of the Lord come--\
5:36\
"To turn the hearts of the\
fathers to the children,\
5:39\
and the children to the\
fathers, lest the whole earth\
5:43\
be smitten with a curse--\
5:44\
"Therefore, the keys\
of this dispensation\
5:48\
are committed into\
your hands; and by\
5:51\
this ye may know that the great\
and dreadful day of the Lord\
5:55\
is near, even at the doors."\
6:00\
Now, I had read that\
account many times.\
6:02\
The Holy Ghost had confirmed to\
me that the account was true.\
6:07\
But as I studied and\
prepared for this conference,\
6:11\
I came to see more clearly\
the power of the Lord\
6:16\
to lead His disciples\
in His work.\
6:22\
Seven years before Moses\
committed to Joseph the keys\
6:26\
of the gathering of Israel\
in the Kirtland Temple,\
6:29\
"Joseph learned from the title\
page of the Book of Mormon that\
6:33\
its purpose was to 'show\
unto the remnant of the house\
6:36\
of Israel ... that they may\
know the covenants of the Lord,\
6:39\
that they are not\
cast off forever.'\
6:42\
In 1831, the Lord told Joseph\
that the gathering of Israel\
6:47\
would commence in\
Kirtland, 'And from thence,\
6:51\
whosoever I will shall go\
forth among all nations ...\
6:55\
for Israel shall be saved,\
and I will lead them.'"\
7:00\
Although missionary work\
was needed to gather Israel,\
7:03\
the Lord taught the\
Twelve, who became\
7:05\
some of our early\
missionaries, "Remember\
7:08\
you are not to go\
to other nations,\
7:11\
till you receive\
your endowment."\
7:14\
It seems that the\
Kirtland Temple\
7:16\
was important to the Lord's\
step-by-step plan for at least\
7:21\
two reasons: First, Moses\
waited until the temple\
7:25\
was completed to\
restore the keys\
7:27\
of the gathering of Israel.\
7:28\
And second, President\
Joseph Fielding Smith\
7:31\
taught that "the Lord\
commanded the Saints to build\
7:34\
a temple in which he could\
reveal the keys of authority\
7:38\
and where the apostles could\
be endowed and prepared\
7:42\
to prune his vineyard\
for the last time."\
7:45\
Although the temple\
endowment as we\
7:48\
know it wasn't administered\
in the Kirtland Temple,\
7:51\
in fulfillment of prophecy,\
preparatory temple ordinances\
7:55\
began to be introduced there,\
along with an outpouring\
7:58\
of spiritual manifestations\
which armed those called\
8:02\
on missions with the\
promised endowment of "power\
8:05\
from on high" that led\
to a great gathering\
8:09\
through missionary service.\
8:12\
After the keys of the\
gathering of Israel\
8:14\
were committed to\
Joseph, the Lord\
8:16\
inspired the Prophet to send\
out members of the Twelve\
8:20\
on missions.\
8:21\
As I studied, it\
became clear to me\
8:24\
that the Lord had prepared in\
detail the way for the Twelve\
8:28\
to go on missions abroad\
where people had been prepared\
8:32\
to believe and sustain them.\
8:34\
In time, thousands\
would, through them,\
8:38\
be brought into the\
Lord's restored Church.\
8:41\
According to our\
records, it is estimated\
8:43\
that between 7,500\
and 8,000 were\
8:47\
baptized during the two\
missions of the Twelve\
8:50\
to the British Isles.\
8:52\
This laid the foundation for\
missionary work in Europe.\
8:56\
By the end of the 19th\
century, some 90,000\
9:00\
had gathered to\
America, with most\
9:03\
of those coming from the\
British Isles and Scandinavia.\
9:07\
The Lord had inspired Joseph and\
those faithful missionaries who\
9:11\
went to work to achieve\
a harvest that must have,\
9:15\
at the time, seemed beyond them.\
9:18\
But the Lord, with His perfect\
foresight and preparation,\
9:23\
made it possible.\
9:25\
You remember the apparently\
simple and almost poetic\
9:28\
language from section 110 of\
the Doctrine and Covenants:\
9:32\
"Behold, the time\
has fully come,\
9:36\
which was spoken of by the mouth\
of Malachi--testifying that he\
9:40\
[Elijah] should be sent, before\
the great and dreadful day\
9:43\
of the Lord ...\
9:44\
"To turn the hearts of the\
fathers to the children,\
9:47\
and the children to the\
fathers, lest the whole earth\
9:50\
be smitten with a curse--\
9:52\
"Therefore, the keys\
of this dispensation\
9:54\
are committed into\
your hands; and by\
9:56\
this ye may know that the great\
and dreadful day of the Lord\
9:59\
is near, even at the doors."\
10:01\
I testify that the Lord\
saw far into the future\
10:05\
and He saw how He would lead\
us to help Him accomplish\
10:10\
His purposes in the last days.\
10:13\
For instance, while I was\
serving in the Presiding\
10:15\
Bishopric many years\
ago, I was charged\
10:19\
with overseeing the design and\
development group that created\
10:23\
what we named FamilySearch.\
10:26\
I am careful to say that I\
"oversaw" its creation rather\
10:29\
than saying I "directed" it.\
10:31\
Many brilliant\
people left careers\
10:34\
and came to build what the Lord\
wanted, and the Lord led it.\
10:38\
The First Presidency\
had set a goal\
10:40\
of reducing the\
duplication of ordinances.\
10:43\
Their major concern\
was our being\
10:45\
unable to know whether a\
person's ordinance had already\
10:48\
been performed.\
10:50\
For years--or what seemed like\
years--the First Presidency\
10:54\
asked me, in a\
penetrating voice,\
10:56\
"When will you have it done?"\
10:59\
With prayer, diligence,\
and the personal sacrifice\
11:02\
of people of great ability,\
the task that they had given\
11:06\
was accomplished.\
11:07\
It came step by step.\
11:10\
And then the task was to make\
FamilySearch more user-friendly\
11:15\
for those who were not\
comfortable with computers.\
11:18\
More changes came, and I know\
they will continue to come,\
11:22\
for whenever we proceed to\
resolve one inspired problem,\
11:27\
we open the door for further\
revelation for advancements\
11:31\
at least equally important\
but not yet seen.\
11:36\
Even today, FamilySearch is\
becoming what the Lord needs\
11:40\
for part of His Restoration--and\
not just for avoiding\
11:44\
duplication of ordinances.\
11:46\
The Lord lets us\
make improvements\
11:48\
to help people gain\
feelings of familiarity\
11:51\
and even love for\
their ancestors\
11:53\
and to complete their\
temple ordinances.\
11:56\
Now, as the Lord surely\
knew would happen,\
11:59\
young people are\
becoming computer mentors\
12:02\
to their parents\
and ward members.\
12:05\
All have found great\
joy in their service.\
12:09\
The spirit of Elijah is changing\
the hearts of young and old,\
12:14\
children and parents,\
grandchildren and grandparents.\
12:18\
Temples will soon again\
be happily scheduling\
12:21\
baptismal opportunities and\
other sacred ordinances.\
12:25\
The desire to\
serve our ancestors\
12:28\
and the bonding of parents\
and children are growing.\
12:32\
The Lord saw it all coming.\
12:34\
He planned for it,\
step by step, as He\
12:38\
has done with other\
changes in His Church.\
12:41\
He has raised up and\
prepared faithful people who\
12:45\
choose to do hard things well.\
12:47\
He has always been\
lovingly patient in helping\
12:51\
us learn "line upon line,\
precept upon precept, here\
12:55\
a little and there a little."\
12:59\
He is firm in the timing and\
the sequence of His intentions,\
13:03\
yet He ensures that\
sacrifice often\
13:06\
brings continuing blessings\
that we did not foresee.\
13:11\
I close by expressing my\
gratitude to the Lord--He who\
13:16\
inspired President Nelson to\
invite me to make a sacrifice\
13:21\
to prepare for this conference.\
13:23\
Every hour and every prayer\
during my preparation\
13:27\
brought a blessing.\
13:29\
I invite all who\
hear this message\
13:31\
or read these\
words to have faith\
13:34\
that the Lord is\
leading the Restoration\
13:36\
of His gospel and His Church.\
13:38\
He goes before us.\
13:41\
He knows the future perfectly.\
13:44\
He invites you to the work.\
13:47\
He joins you in it.\
13:50\
He has in place a\
plan for your service.\
13:55\
He loves you.\
13:57\
And even as you sacrifice,\
you will feel joy\
14:01\
as you help others rise to\
be ready for His coming.\
14:05\
I testify to you that\
God the Father lives.\
14:10\
Jesus is the Christ.\
14:12\
This is His Church.\
14:13\
He knows you.\
14:15\
He guides you.\
14:17\
In the service of\
this kingdom of God,\
14:22\
I bear you my testimony\
that He loves you,\
14:25\
that He has prepared\
the way for you.\
14:28\
He goes before your face in\
every service you give to Him.\
14:33\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
