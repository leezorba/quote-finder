On a sunny spring day\
in 2017, the open house\
0:05\
for the Paris France\
Temple was well underway\
0:08\
when one of the tour\
guides was approached\
0:11\
by a man with a sorrowful\
expression on his face.\
0:14\
He said he lived\
next to the temple\
0:17\
and admitted he had\
been an active opponent\
0:20\
of its construction.\
0:21\
He related that one day as he\
was gazing out of his apartment\
0:26\
window, he watched a large\
crane lower a statue of Jesus\
0:30\
from the heavens and softly\
place it on the temple grounds.\
0:35\
The man declared that this\
experience completely changed\
0:39\
his feelings toward our Church.\
0:41\
He realized we were\
followers of Jesus Christ\
0:45\
and begged our forgiveness\
for the previous harm\
0:49\
he might have caused.\
0:51\
The statue of the\
Christus, which\
0:53\
adorns the grounds of the\
Paris Temple and other Church\
0:56\
properties, testifies of\
our love for the Savior.\
1:00\
The original marble statue is\
the work of the Danish artist\
1:04\
Bertel Thorvaldsen, who sculpted\
it in 1820--the same year\
1:10\
as the First Vision.\
1:11\
The statue stands\
in stark contrast\
1:15\
to most of the\
artistic renderings\
1:16\
of that period, which\
largely portray the suffering\
1:20\
Christ on the cross.\
1:22\
Thorvaldsen's work\
presents the living Christ,\
1:26\
who gained victory over\
death and, with open arms,\
1:29\
invites all to come unto Him.\
1:32\
Only the prints of the\
nails in His hands and feet\
1:36\
and the wound in\
His side testify\
1:39\
of the indescribable agony He\
endured to save all mankind.\
1:45\
Perhaps one reason we as\
members of The Church of Jesus\
1:49\
Christ of Latter-day\
Saints love this statue\
1:52\
is that it reminds us\
of the description given\
1:55\
in the Book of Mormon of\
the Savior's appearance\
1:59\
on the American continent:\
2:00\
"And behold, they saw a Man\
descending out of heaven;\
2:06\
and he was clothed\
in a white robe;\
2:09\
and he came down and stood\
in the midst of them.\
2:13\
...\
2:13\
"And it came to pass that\
he stretched forth his hand\
2:16\
and spake unto the\
people, saying:\
2:20\
"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, ...\
2:22\
"...\
2:23\
I have drunk out of\
that bitter cup which\
2:25\
the Father hath\
given me, and have\
2:28\
glorified the Father in taking\
upon me the sins of the world."\
2:34\
Then He invited each\
man, woman, and child\
2:37\
to come forth and thrust\
their hands into His side\
2:41\
and feel the prints of the\
nails in His hands and feet,\
2:45\
thereby receiving\
a personal witness\
2:48\
that He was indeed the\
long-awaited Messiah.\
2:53\
This sublime scene is the\
climax of the Book of Mormon.\
2:56\
The entire "good\
news" of the gospel\
2:59\
is contained in this image\
of the Savior tenderly\
3:03\
extending His "arms of mercy"\
to invite each individual\
3:07\
to come unto Him and receive\
the blessings of His Atonement.\
3:13\
The central message\
of the Book of Mormon\
3:14\
is to restore the true\
knowledge of the essential role\
3:19\
of Jesus Christ in the salvation\
and exaltation of mankind.\
3:24\
This theme reverberates\
from the introductory page\
3:28\
through the very last\
words of the last chapter.\
3:31\
Through centuries of apostasy\
and spiritual confusion,\
3:35\
the deeper meaning\
of what Christ\
3:37\
did in Gethsemane\
and on Golgotha\
3:41\
became lost or corrupted.\
3:44\
How excited Joseph Smith\
must have felt when,\
3:47\
as he was translating 1 Nephi,\
he discovered this marvelous\
3:51\
promise: "These last records\
[the Book of Mormon]...shall\
3:57\
establish the truth of\
the first [the Bible] ...\
4:01\
and shall make known the plain\
and precious things which have\
4:05\
been taken away from them;\
and shall make known to all\
4:09\
kindreds, tongues, and people,\
that the Lamb of God is the Son\
4:15\
of the Eternal Father, and\
the Savior of the world;\
4:18\
and that all men must come unto\
him, or they cannot be saved."\
4:25\
Plain and precious truths\
about the Savior's Atonement\
4:29\
resound throughout\
the Book of Mormon.\
4:32\
As I list several\
of these truths,\
4:34\
I invite you to reflect on\
how they have changed or could\
4:39\
change your life.\
4:41\
First, the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ\
4:44\
is a free gift\
offered to all who\
4:47\
have lived, who currently live,\
and who will live on the earth.\
4:53\
Second, in addition to bearing\
the burden of our sins,\
4:57\
the Christ took upon Himself\
our sorrows, infirmities,\
5:02\
sufferings, sicknesses,\
and all the afflictions\
5:06\
inherent in the mortal\
condition of man.\
5:09\
There is no anguish,\
no pain or sadness\
5:12\
that He did not suffer for us.\
5:17\
Third, the atoning\
sacrifice of the Savior\
5:20\
allows us to overcome the\
negative consequences of Adam's\
5:23\
fall, including physical death.\
5:26\
Because of Christ, all of God's\
children born on this earth,\
5:32\
regardless of their\
righteousness,\
5:34\
will experience the reuniting\
of their spirits and bodies\
5:38\
through the power of the\
Resurrection and return to Him\
5:42\
to "be judged ... according\
to [their] works."\
5:46\
Fourth, in contrast,\
receiving the full blessings\
5:51\
of the Savior's Atonement is\
conditioned upon our diligence\
5:55\
in living the\
"doctrine of Christ."\
5:58\
In his dream, Lehi saw the\
"strait and narrow path"\
6:02\
that leads to the tree of life.\
6:05\
Its fruit, which represents\
the love of God as expressed\
6:09\
through the exquisite blessings\
of Christ's Atonement,\
6:12\
is "most precious and\
most desirable ...\
6:16\
[and] is the greatest of\
all the gifts of God."\
6:20\
In order to access\
this fruit, we\
6:23\
must exercise faith\
in Jesus Christ,\
6:25\
repent, "hearken unto\
the word of God,"\
6:29\
receive essential ordinances,\
and keep sacred covenants\
6:33\
until the end of our lives.\
6:36\
Fifth, through His Atonement,\
Jesus Christ not only washes\
6:40\
away our sins, but He also\
provides enabling power through\
6:45\
which His disciples may\
"[put] off the natural man,"\
6:48\
progress "line upon line," and\
increase in holiness so that\
6:54\
one day they might become\
perfect beings in the image\
6:57\
of Christ, qualified to live\
again with God and inherit all\
7:02\
the blessings of the\
kingdom of heaven.\
7:06\
Another comforting truth\
contained in the Book of Mormon\
7:09\
is that, although infinite\
and universal in its reach,\
7:14\
the Lord's Atonement\
is a remarkably\
7:17\
personal and intimate\
gift, suited to each of us\
7:21\
individually.\
7:23\
Just as Jesus invited each\
one of the Nephite disciples\
7:27\
to feel His wounds, He\
died for each one of us,\
7:31\
personally, as if you or I\
were the only person on earth.\
7:37\
He extends to us a personal\
invitation to come unto Him\
7:41\
and draw upon the marvelous\
blessings of His Atonement.\
7:47\
The personal nature\
of Christ's Atonement\
7:49\
becomes even more\
real as we consider\
7:52\
the examples of\
remarkable men and women\
7:55\
in the Book of Mormon.\
7:56\
Among them are Enos,\
Alma, Zeezrom, King\
8:01\
Lamoni and his wife, and\
the people of King Benjamin.\
8:04\
Their conversion stories\
and vibrant testimonies\
8:07\
provide a living witness of\
how our hearts can be changed\
8:12\
and our lives transformed\
through the Lord's infinite\
8:16\
goodness and mercy.\
8:18\
The prophet Alma asked his\
people this burning question.\
8:22\
He said, "If ye have\
experienced a change of heart,\
8:26\
and if ye have felt to sing\
the song of redeeming love,\
8:30\
I would ask, can\
ye feel so now?"\
8:34\
This question is vital\
today because, as disciples\
8:38\
of the Lord, His\
redeeming power should\
8:40\
accompany us, motivate us, and\
change us each and every day.\
8:46\
Alma's question could\
also be rephrased\
8:49\
to ask, when was\
the last time you\
8:51\
felt the sweet influence\
of the Savior's Atonement\
8:55\
in your life?\
8:56\
This happens when you feel an\
"exquisite and sweet" joy come\
9:01\
over you that bears\
witness to your soul\
9:04\
that your sins are forgiven;\
or when painful trials suddenly\
9:09\
become lighter to bear; or\
when your heart is softened\
9:14\
and you are able to\
express forgiveness\
9:16\
to someone who has hurt you.\
9:19\
Or it may be each time\
you notice your capacity\
9:22\
to love and serve\
others has increased\
9:25\
or that the process\
of sanctification\
9:28\
is making you a different\
person, patterned\
9:31\
after the Savior's example.\
9:34\
I bear witness that all these\
experiences are real and are\
9:39\
evidences that lives can be\
changed through faith in Jesus\
9:43\
Christ and His Atonement.\
9:45\
The Book of Mormon\
clarifies and expands\
9:48\
our knowledge of\
this supernal gift.\
9:51\
As you study this\
book, you will hear\
9:54\
the voice of the living Christ\
inviting you to come unto Him.\
9:58\
I promise that if you accept\
this invitation and pattern\
10:03\
your life after His example,\
His redemptive influence\
10:08\
will come into your life.\
10:10\
Through the power\
of the Holy Ghost,\
10:12\
the Savior will transform\
you day after day\
10:15\
"until the perfect day" when\
you will, as He declared,\
10:19\
"see my face and\
know that I am."\
10:23\
In the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
