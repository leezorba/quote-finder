Thank You allure Suarez for your\
0:03\
powerful and prophetic testimony of the\
0:05\
Book of Mormon recently I had the unique\
0:09\
opportunity to hold a page of the\
0:11\
original manuscript of the Book of\
0:13\
Mormon\
0:13\
on this particular page for the first\
0:17\
time in this dispensation these bold\
0:20\
words of Nephi were recorded I will go\
0:24\
and do the things which the LORD hath\
0:26\
commanded for I know that the Lord\
0:28\
giveth no Commandments unto the children\
0:30\
of men save he shall prepare a way for\
0:34\
them that they may accomplish the thing\
0:36\
which he commanded them as I held this\
0:39\
page I was filled with a profound\
0:42\
appreciation for the efforts of the 23\
0:44\
year old Joseph Smith who translated the\
0:47\
Book of Mormon by the gift and power of\
0:49\
God I also felt appreciation for the\
0:53\
words of a young Nephi who had been\
0:55\
asked to perform a very difficult task\
0:58\
in obtaining the plates of brass from\
1:01\
Lebanon Nephi knew that if he continued\
1:05\
to stay focused on the Lord he would be\
1:07\
successful in fulfilling what the LORD\
1:09\
commanded him he remained focused on the\
1:13\
Savior throughout his life even though\
1:16\
he suffered temptations physical trials\
1:19\
and even the betrayal of some in his\
1:21\
immediate family Nephi knew in whom he\
1:25\
could trust\
1:25\
shortly after exclaiming a wretched man\
1:29\
that I am yeah my heart's arith because\
1:32\
of my flesh Nephi stated my God hath\
1:36\
been my support\
1:37\
he hath led me through minor fictions in\
1:40\
the wilderness and he hath preserved me\
1:43\
upon the waters of the great deep as\
1:45\
followers of Christ we are not spared\
1:48\
challenges and trials in our lives we\
1:50\
are often required to do difficult\
1:52\
things that if attempted alone would be\
1:56\
overwhelming and maybe impossible as we\
1:59\
accept the Savior's invitation to come\
2:01\
unto me he will provide the support\
2:04\
comfort and peace that is necessary just\
2:08\
as he did for Nephi and Joseph even in\
2:13\
our deepest\
2:13\
we can feel the warm embrace of his love\
2:16\
as we trust him and accept his will we\
2:20\
can experience the joy reserved for his\
2:22\
faithful disciples for Christ is joy in\
2:29\
2014 while serving a full-time mission\
2:32\
our family experienced an unexpected\
2:35\
turn of events when riding down a steep\
2:38\
hill on a longboard our youngest son\
2:41\
fell and sustained a life-threatening\
2:43\
threatening injury to his brain as his\
2:47\
situation deteriorated medical personnel\
2:50\
rushed him into emergency surgery our\
2:54\
family knelt on the floor of an\
2:56\
otherwise empty hospital room and we\
2:58\
poured our hearts out to God in the\
3:02\
midst of this confusing and painful\
3:03\
moment we were filled with our Heavenly\
3:06\
Father's love and peace we did not know\
3:10\
what the future held or if we would see\
3:13\
our son alive again we did know very\
3:16\
clearly that his life was in God's hands\
3:19\
and the results from an eternal\
3:21\
perspective would work out for his and\
3:24\
our good through the gift of the Spirit\
3:28\
we were fully prepared to accept any\
3:30\
outcome it was not easy the accident\
3:34\
resulted in a two-month hospital stay\
3:36\
while we were were presiding over 400\
3:39\
full-time missionaries our son\
3:41\
experienced a significant loss of memory\
3:44\
his recovery included long and difficult\
3:47\
physical speech and occupational therapy\
3:50\
sessions the challenges remain but over\
3:54\
time we have witnessed a miracle we\
3:57\
understand clearly that not every trial\
4:00\
we face will have a result we wish for\
4:02\
however as we remain focused on Christ\
4:05\
we will feel peace and see God's\
4:08\
miracles whatever they may be in his\
4:11\
time and in his way there will be times\
4:15\
when we will not be able to see any way\
4:18\
that our current situation will end well\
4:20\
and might even Express as Nephi my\
4:23\
hearts our earth because of my flesh\
4:26\
there\
4:27\
maybe times that the only hope we have\
4:28\
is in Jesus Christ what a blessing to\
4:33\
have that hope and trust in him Christ\
4:36\
is the one who will always keep his\
4:38\
promises his rest is assured for all who\
4:41\
come unto him our leaders deeply desire\
4:44\
all to fill the peace and comfort that\
4:46\
comes through trusting in and focusing\
4:48\
on the Savior Jesus Christ our living\
4:50\
prophet President Russell M Nelson has\
4:52\
been communicating the Lord's vision for\
4:54\
the world and for members of Christ's\
4:56\
Church quote our message the world is\
4:59\
simple and sincere we invite all of\
5:01\
God's children on both sides of the veil\
5:03\
to come unto their Savior receive the\
5:06\
blessings of the Holy Temple having\
5:07\
during joy and qualify for eternal life\
5:10\
close quote this invitation to come unto\
5:13\
Christ has specific implications for\
5:16\
latter-day saints as members of the\
5:18\
Savior's church we have made covenants\
5:21\
with him and have have become his\
5:23\
spiritually begotten sons and daughters\
5:25\
we have also been given the opportunity\
5:27\
to labor with the Lord and inviting\
5:29\
others to come unto Him as we labor with\
5:32\
Christ our most deeply focused efforts\
5:35\
should be within our own homes there\
5:37\
will be times when family members and\
5:39\
close friends will face challenges the\
5:42\
voices of the world and maybe their own\
5:44\
desires might cause them to question\
5:46\
truth\
5:47\
we should do everything we can to help\
5:50\
them feel both the Savior's love in our\
5:52\
love I'm reminded of the scripture verse\
5:54\
that has become our beloved hymn love\
5:58\
one another which teaches us by this\
6:00\
shall men know ye are my disciples if\
6:03\
you have love one to another and our\
6:06\
love for those who are questioning truth\
6:08\
the enemy of all joy might try to make\
6:11\
us feel that we betray those we love if\
6:13\
we ourselves continue to live the\
6:16\
fullness of the gospel and teach its\
6:18\
truth our ability to help others come\
6:21\
unto Christ or return to Christ will\
6:24\
largely be determined by the example we\
6:26\
set through our own personal commitment\
6:28\
to stay on the covenant path if our true\
6:32\
desire is to rescue those we love we\
6:35\
ourselves must stay firmly with Christ\
6:38\
by embracing his church\
6:40\
and the fullness of his gospel in\
6:43\
returning to Nephi story we know that\
6:46\
Nephi's inclination to trust in the Lord\
6:48\
was influenced by his parents propensity\
6:50\
to trust in the Lord and by their\
6:53\
covenant keeping example this is\
6:55\
beautifully exemplified in Lehi vision\
6:57\
of the tree of life after partaking of\
7:00\
the sweet and joyful fruit of the tree\
7:01\
Lehi cast his eyes round about that\
7:04\
perhaps he might discover his family he\
7:07\
saw seraya Sam and Nephi standing as if\
7:11\
they knew not whether they should go\
7:13\
Lehi then stated I beckoned unto them\
7:16\
and I also did sand to them with a loud\
7:18\
voice that they should come unto me and\
7:20\
partake of the fruit please note that\
7:23\
Lehi did not leave the Tree of Life\
7:26\
he stayed spiritually with the Lord and\
7:29\
invited his family to come where he was\
7:32\
to partake of the fruit the adversary\
7:36\
would entice um to leave the joy of the\
7:38\
gospel by separating Christ's teachings\
7:40\
from his church he would have us believe\
7:42\
that we can stay firmly on the covenant\
7:44\
path on our own through our own\
7:47\
spirituality independent of his church\
7:49\
and these latter days Christ church was\
7:52\
restored in order to help Christ's\
7:53\
covenant children stay on his covenant\
7:55\
path and the doctrine of covenants we\
7:58\
read behold this is my doctrine\
8:00\
whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me\
8:03\
the same as my church through Christ\
8:06\
Church we are strengthened through our\
8:07\
experiences as a community of saints we\
8:09\
hear his voice through his prophets\
8:11\
seers and Revelator's most importantly\
8:13\
through his church we are provided with\
8:16\
all the essential blessings of Christ's\
8:19\
atonement that can only be realized\
8:21\
through participation as sacred\
8:23\
ordinances the Church of Jesus Christ of\
8:25\
latter-day saints is Christ's Church on\
8:27\
the earth restored in these latter days\
8:30\
for the benefit of all of God's children\
8:31\
I bear witness that as we come into\
8:34\
Christ and live as latter-day saints we\
8:36\
will be blessed with an added measure of\
8:38\
his love his joy in this peace like\
8:41\
Nephi\
8:41\
we can do difficult things and help\
8:43\
others do the same because we know in\
8:45\
whom we can trust Christ as our light\
8:48\
our life and our salvation\
8:51\
in the name of Jesus Christ a\
8:54\
man\
9:06\
you\
