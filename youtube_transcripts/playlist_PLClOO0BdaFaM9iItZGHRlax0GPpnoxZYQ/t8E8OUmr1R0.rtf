In the Sacred Grove 200\
years ago, young Joseph Smith\
0:06\
saw and talked with\
God, the Eternal Father,\
0:09\
and His Son, Jesus Christ.\
0:12\
From Them, Joseph learned about\
the true nature of the Godhead\
0:16\
and of ongoing revelation\
as this supernal vision\
0:20\
ushered in the\
latter-day "dispensation\
0:23\
of the fulness of times."\
0:26\
Approximately three\
years later, in response\
0:28\
to earnest prayer on the\
evening of September 21, 1823,\
0:35\
Joseph's bedroom\
filled with light\
0:37\
until it was "lighter\
than at noonday."\
0:40\
A personage appeared\
at his bedside,\
0:43\
called the young boy by\
name, and declared "he was\
0:46\
a messenger sent from\
the presence of God ...\
0:48\
and that his name was Moroni."\
0:51\
He instructed Joseph\
about the coming\
0:54\
forth of the Book of Mormon.\
0:57\
And then Moroni quoted\
from the book of Malachi\
0:59\
in the Old Testament,\
with a little variation\
1:02\
in the language used in\
the King James Version:\
1:06\
"Behold, I will reveal\
unto you the Priesthood,\
1:10\
by the hand of\
Elijah the prophet,\
1:12\
before the coming of the great\
and dreadful day of the Lord.\
1:16\
...\
1:17\
"And he shall plant in\
the hearts of the children\
1:19\
the promises made\
to the fathers,\
1:22\
and the hearts of the children\
shall turn to their fathers.\
1:27\
If it were not so,\
the whole earth\
1:29\
would be utterly\
wasted at his coming."\
1:33\
Importantly,\
Moroni's instruction\
1:35\
to Joseph Smith about\
Elijah's mission\
1:38\
initiated temple and family\
history work in the latter days\
1:42\
and was a key element in\
restoring "all things, which\
1:47\
God hath spoken by the mouth\
of all his holy prophets\
1:51\
since the world began."\
1:54\
I pray for the assistance\
of the Holy Ghost\
1:57\
as we learn together about\
the covenants, ordinances,\
2:00\
and blessings that\
are available to us\
2:03\
in the temples of The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
2:07\
Saints.\
2:10\
I begin by asking a\
fundamental question: Why was\
2:14\
the return of Elijah important?\
2:17\
"We learn from\
latter-day revelation\
2:19\
that Elijah held the sealing\
power of the Melchizedek\
2:23\
Priesthood" and was\
the last prophet\
2:26\
to do so before the\
time of Jesus Christ.\
2:30\
The Prophet Joseph Smith\
explained: "The spirit, power,\
2:35\
and calling of Elijah is, that\
ye have power to hold the key\
2:40\
of the ... fullness of the\
Melchizedek Priesthood ... ;\
2:43\
and to ... obtain ... all\
the ordinances belonging\
2:46\
to the kingdom of God, even\
[to] the turning of the hearts\
2:50\
of the fathers\
unto the children,\
2:52\
and the hearts of the\
children unto the fathers,\
2:55\
even those who are in heaven."\
2:58\
This sacred sealing\
authority is necessary\
3:03\
so that "whatsoever\
thou shalt bind on earth\
3:06\
shall be bound in heaven:\
and whatsoever thou shalt\
3:10\
loose on earth shall\
be loosed in heaven."\
3:15\
JOSEPH FURTHER\
CLARIFIED: "How shall God\
3:18\
come to the rescue\
of this generation?\
3:21\
He will send Elijah the prophet.\
3:23\
...\
3:24\
Elijah shall reveal\
the covenants\
3:27\
to seal the hearts of the\
fathers to the children,\
3:30\
and the children\
to the fathers."\
3:35\
Elijah appeared with Moses on\
the Mount of Transfiguration\
3:39\
and conferred this authority\
upon Peter, James, and John.\
3:43\
Elijah also appeared with Moses\
and Elias on April 3, 1836,\
3:49\
in the Kirtland\
Temple and conferred\
3:53\
the same priesthood keys\
upon Joseph Smith and Oliver\
3:58\
Cowdery.\
4:00\
The restoration of the sealing\
authority by Elijah in 1836\
4:04\
was necessary to prepare the\
world for the Savior's Second\
4:08\
Coming and initiated a greatly\
increased and worldwide\
4:13\
interest in family\
history research.\
4:19\
The word heart is\
used over 1,000 times\
4:23\
in the standard works.\
4:24\
This simple but\
significant word often\
4:28\
denotes the inner\
feelings of an individual.\
4:31\
Our hearts--the sum total\
of our desires, affections,\
4:36\
intentions, motives, and\
attitudes--define who we are\
4:41\
and determine what\
we will become.\
4:44\
And the essence\
of the Lord's work\
4:47\
is changing, turning,\
and purifying hearts\
4:52\
through gospel covenants\
and priesthood ordinances.\
4:57\
We do not build or enter\
holy temples solely\
5:01\
to have a memorable individual\
or family experience.\
5:05\
Rather, the covenants\
received and the ordinances\
5:08\
performed in temples are\
essential to the sanctifying\
5:11\
of our hearts and for\
the ultimate exaltation\
5:15\
of God's sons and daughters.\
5:19\
Planting in the hearts of the\
children the promises made\
5:22\
to the fathers--even\
Abraham, Isaac,\
5:26\
and Jacob--turning the hearts\
of the children to their own\
5:30\
fathers, conducting\
family history research,\
5:34\
and performing vicarious temple\
ordinances are labors that\
5:38\
bless individuals on\
both sides of the veil.\
5:42\
As we become anxiously\
engaged in this sacred work,\
5:46\
we are obeying the\
commandments to love and serve\
5:49\
God and our neighbors.\
5:51\
And such selfless service\
truly helps us to "hear Him!"\
5:57\
and come unto the Savior.\
6:01\
The most sacred covenants\
and priesthood ordinances are\
6:04\
received only in a\
temple--the house of the Lord.\
6:08\
Everything that is learned and\
all that is done in the temple\
6:11\
emphasizes the divinity\
of Jesus Christ\
6:15\
and His role in Heavenly\
Father's great plan\
6:19\
of happiness.\
6:22\
President Ezra Taft Benson\
described an important pattern\
6:25\
the Redeemer employs\
in bringing "to pass\
6:28\
the immortality and\
eternal life of man."\
6:31\
He said: "The Lord works\
from the inside out.\
6:37\
The world works\
from the outside in.\
6:40\
The world would take\
people out of the slums.\
6:44\
Christ takes the\
slums out of people,\
6:47\
and then they take\
themselves out of the slums.\
6:51\
The world would mold men by\
changing their environment.\
6:55\
Christ changes men, who then\
change their environment.\
7:00\
The world would\
shape human behavior,\
7:03\
but Christ can\
change human nature."\
7:08\
Covenants and\
priesthood ordinances\
7:10\
are central in the ongoing\
process of spiritual rebirth\
7:15\
and transformation;\
they are the means\
7:18\
whereby the Lord works with\
each of us from the inside out.\
7:24\
Covenants that are honored\
steadfastly, remembered always,\
7:29\
and written "with the\
Spirit of the living God ...\
7:31\
in fleshy tables of the\
heart" provide purpose\
7:35\
and the assurance of blessings\
in mortality and for eternity.\
7:39\
Ordinances that are received\
worthily and remembered\
7:43\
continually open the\
heavenly channels\
7:46\
through which the\
power of godliness\
7:49\
can flow into our lives.\
7:53\
We do not come to the temple\
to hide from or escape\
7:57\
the evils of the world.\
7:59\
Rather, we come to the temple\
to conquer the world of evil.\
8:04\
As we invite into our lives\
the "power of godliness"\
8:08\
by receiving\
priesthood ordinances\
8:10\
and making and keeping\
sacred covenants,\
8:13\
we are blessed with\
strength beyond our own\
8:16\
to overcome the temptations\
and challenges of mortality\
8:20\
and to do and become good.\
8:26\
The first temple of\
this dispensation\
8:28\
was constructed\
in Kirtland, Ohio,\
8:30\
and dedicated on March 27, 1836.\
8:33\
In a revelation to the\
Prophet Joseph Smith\
8:38\
one week after the\
dedication, the Lord declared:\
8:43\
"Let the hearts of\
all my people rejoice,\
8:46\
who have, with their might,\
built this house to my name.\
8:49\
...\
8:50\
"Yea the hearts of thousands\
and tens of thousands\
8:53\
shall greatly rejoice\
in consequence\
8:56\
of the blessings which\
shall be poured out,\
8:59\
and the endowment with\
which my servants have\
9:01\
been endowed in this house.\
9:05\
"And the fame of this house\
shall spread to foreign lands;\
9:08\
and this is the beginning\
of the blessing which\
9:11\
shall be poured out upon\
the heads of my people."\
9:16\
Please note the phrases "the\
hearts of thousands and tens\
9:21\
of thousands shall\
greatly rejoice"\
9:23\
and "the fame of this house\
shall spread to foreign lands."\
9:29\
These were stunning\
declarations in April of 1836,\
9:32\
when the Church had\
only a relative handful\
9:36\
of members and one temple.\
9:40\
Today in 2020, we have\
168 operating temples.\
9:45\
Forty-nine additional temples\
are under construction\
9:49\
or have been announced.\
9:51\
Houses of the Lord\
are being constructed\
9:54\
on the "isles of the sea" and\
in countries and locations\
9:58\
previously considered by many\
unlikely to warrant a temple.\
10:04\
The endowment ceremony currently\
is presented in 88 languages\
10:09\
and will become available\
in many additional languages\
10:12\
as temples are built to\
bless more of God's children.\
10:16\
In the next 15 years,\
the number of languages\
10:20\
in which temple ordinances\
will be available likely\
10:24\
will double.\
10:26\
This year we will break\
ground and start construction\
10:29\
on 18 temples.\
10:31\
In contrast, it took 150\
years to build the first 18\
10:38\
temples, from the organization\
of the Church in 1830\
10:43\
to the dedication of\
the Tokyo Japan Temple\
10:46\
by President Spencer\
W. Kimball in 1980.\
10:52\
Consider the hastening\
of temple work\
10:54\
that has occurred just during\
the lifetime of President\
10:58\
Russell M. Nelson.\
11:00\
When President Nelson was\
born on September 9, 1924,\
11:04\
the Church had six\
operating temples.\
11:11\
When he was ordained an\
Apostle on April 7, 1984,\
11:15\
60 years later, 26 temples\
were operating, an increase\
11:21\
of 20 temples in 60 years.\
11:26\
When President\
Nelson was sustained\
11:28\
as President of the\
Church, 159 temples\
11:33\
were operating, an increase\
of 133 temples in the 34 years\
11:40\
during which he\
served as a member\
11:42\
of the Quorum of the Twelve.\
11:45\
Since becoming the President of\
the Church on January 14, 2018,\
11:49\
President Nelson has\
announced 35 new temples.\
11:57\
Ninety-six percent of\
the existing temples\
12:01\
have been dedicated during\
President Nelson's lifetime;\
12:05\
84 percent have been\
dedicated since he\
12:10\
was ordained an Apostle.\
12:14\
As members of the\
Lord's restored Church,\
12:17\
we stand all amazed at\
the ever-accelerating pace\
12:21\
of His work in the latter days.\
12:23\
And more temples are coming.\
12:27\
Brigham Young prophesied,\
"To accomplish\
12:31\
this work there will\
have to be not only one\
12:34\
temple but thousands of\
them, and thousands and tens\
12:39\
of thousands of men and women\
will go into those temples\
12:43\
and officiate for people\
who have lived as far\
12:47\
back as the Lord shall reveal."\
12:53\
Understandably, the\
announcement of each new temple\
12:57\
is a source of great\
joy and a reason\
13:00\
to give thanks to the Lord.\
13:02\
However, our\
primary focus should\
13:05\
be on the covenants\
and ordinances that\
13:07\
can change our hearts and deepen\
our devotion to the Savior\
13:12\
and not simply on the location\
or beauty of the building.\
13:18\
The fundamental obligations\
that rest upon us\
13:21\
as members of the\
Lord's restored Church\
13:23\
are (1) to "hear Him!"\
13:26\
and have our own hearts\
changed through covenants\
13:30\
and ordinances and (2)\
to fulfill joyfully\
13:35\
the divinely appointed\
responsibility\
13:38\
to offer temple blessings\
to the entire human family\
13:42\
on both sides of the veil.\
13:45\
With the Lord's\
direction and help,\
13:48\
indeed we will fulfill\
these sacred duties.\
13:55\
The Prophet Joseph\
Smith declared:\
14:01\
"The building up of Zion is\
a cause that has interested\
14:06\
the people of God in every\
age; it is a theme upon which\
14:11\
prophets, priests and kings have\
dwelt with peculiar delight;\
14:18\
they have looked forward with\
joyful anticipation to the day\
14:22\
in which we live; and fired\
with heavenly and joyful\
14:26\
anticipations they have sung and\
written and prophesied of this\
14:33\
our day; but they died\
without the sight; ...\
14:37\
it is left for us to see,\
participate in and help to roll\
14:43\
forward the Latter-day glory."\
14:46\
"The heavenly Priesthood\
will unite with the earthly,\
14:49\
to bring about those\
great purposes; ...\
14:52\
a work that God and angels\
have contemplated with delight\
14:56\
for generations past; that\
fired the souls of the ancient\
15:01\
patriarchs and prophets; a work\
that is destined to bring about\
15:05\
the destruction of the\
powers of darkness,\
15:08\
the renovation of the\
earth, the glory of God,\
15:12\
and the salvation of\
the human family."\
15:20\
I solemnly testify that\
the Father and the Son\
15:23\
appeared to Joseph\
Smith, and Elijah\
15:27\
restored the sealing authority.\
15:29\
Sacred temple covenants\
and ordinances\
15:32\
can strengthen us and purify\
our hearts as we "hear Him!"\
15:37\
and receive the power of\
godliness in our lives.\
15:41\
And I witness that\
this latter-day work\
15:45\
will destroy the\
powers of darkness\
15:48\
and bring about the salvation\
of the human family.\
15:52\
Of these truths I joyfully\
testify in the sacred name\
15:57\
of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
