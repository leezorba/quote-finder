Even in the midst of unique\
trials and challenges,\
0:06\
we are truly blessed!\
0:09\
This general\
conference has given us\
0:11\
an outpouring of the riches\
and joy of the Restoration\
0:16\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
0:18\
We have rejoiced in the\
vision of the Father\
0:21\
and the Son that\
commenced the Restoration.\
0:25\
We have been reminded of\
the miraculous coming forth\
0:29\
of the Book of\
Mormon, whose central\
0:31\
purpose is to testify of\
Jesus Christ and His doctrine.\
0:36\
We have been renewed with the\
joyful reality of revelation\
0:41\
to prophets and\
to us personally.\
0:44\
We have heard\
precious testimonies\
0:47\
of the infinite\
Atonement of Jesus Christ\
0:50\
and of His literal Resurrection.\
0:53\
And we have been\
taught other truths\
0:56\
of the fulness of His gospel\
revealed to Joseph Smith\
1:00\
after God the Father declared\
to that newly called prophet:\
1:05\
"This is My Beloved Son.\
1:08\
Hear Him!"\
1:11\
We have been affirmed in our\
knowledge of the Restoration\
1:14\
of the priesthood and its keys.\
1:17\
We have been renewed\
in our determination\
1:20\
to have the Lord's\
restored Church known\
1:23\
by its proper name, The Church\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
1:28\
Saints.\
1:29\
And we have been invited to\
join in fasting and prayer\
1:34\
to minimize the present\
and future effects\
1:37\
of a devastating\
worldwide pandemic.\
1:41\
This morning we were inspired\
by the Lord's living prophet\
1:45\
presenting an\
historic proclamation\
1:49\
of the Restoration.\
1:50\
We affirm its declaration\
that "those who prayerfully\
1:55\
study the message of the\
Restoration and act in faith\
2:00\
will be blessed to gain their\
own witness of its divinity\
2:04\
and of its purpose to prepare\
the world for the promised\
2:08\
Second Coming of our Lord\
and Savior, Jesus Christ."\
2:16\
All of this is part of a\
divine plan whose purpose\
2:20\
is to enable the children of\
God to be exalted and become\
2:24\
like Him.\
2:25\
Referred to in the scriptures as\
the "great plan of happiness,"\
2:30\
"the plan of redemption,"\
and "the plan of salvation,"\
2:34\
that plan--revealed in the\
Restoration--began with\
2:39\
a Council in Heaven.\
2:40\
As spirits, we\
desired to achieve\
2:44\
the eternal life enjoyed\
by our Heavenly Parents.\
2:49\
At that point we had\
progressed as far\
2:52\
as we could without a mortal\
experience in a physical body.\
2:57\
To provide that\
experience, God the Father\
3:00\
planned to create this earth.\
3:03\
In the planned\
mortal life, we would\
3:05\
be soiled by sin as we\
faced the opposition\
3:09\
necessary for our\
spiritual growth.\
3:13\
We would also become\
subject to physical death.\
3:17\
To reclaim us from\
death and sin,\
3:21\
our Heavenly Father's plan\
would provide a Savior.\
3:25\
His Resurrection would\
redeem all from death,\
3:29\
and His atoning sacrifice would\
pay the price necessary for all\
3:35\
to be cleansed from sin on\
the conditions prescribed\
3:39\
to promote our growth.\
3:41\
This Atonement of\
Jesus Christ is\
3:45\
central to the Father's plan.\
3:50\
In the Council in Heaven, all\
the spirit children of God\
3:53\
were introduced to\
the Father's plan,\
3:56\
including its mortal\
consequences and trials,\
4:01\
its heavenly helps, and\
its glorious destiny.\
4:05\
We saw the end\
from the beginning.\
4:10\
All of the myriads\
of mortals who\
4:12\
have been born on this earth\
chose the Father's plan\
4:15\
and fought for it in the\
heavenly contest that followed.\
4:19\
Many also made covenants with\
the Father concerning what\
4:23\
they would do in mortality.\
4:25\
In ways that have\
not been revealed,\
4:29\
our actions in the spirit\
world have influenced\
4:32\
our circumstances in mortality.\
4:38\
I will now summarize some\
of the principal elements\
4:41\
of the Father's plan\
as they affect us\
4:44\
during our mortal\
journeys and in the spirit\
4:47\
world that follows.\
4:49\
The purpose of mortal life\
and the postmortal growth\
4:52\
that can follow is for\
the offspring of God\
4:57\
to become as He is.\
4:59\
This is Heavenly Father's\
desire for all His children.\
5:04\
To achieve this joyful\
destiny, eternal laws\
5:08\
require that we must\
become purified beings\
5:12\
through the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ\
5:14\
so we can dwell in the presence\
of the Father and the Son\
5:18\
and enjoy the blessings\
of exaltation.\
5:22\
As the Book of\
Mormon teaches, He\
5:24\
invites all "to come unto him\
and partake of his goodness;\
5:29\
and he denieth none that come\
unto him, black and white, bond\
5:34\
and free, male and female; and\
he remembereth the heathen;\
5:38\
and all are alike unto God."\
5:44\
The divine plan for us to become\
what we are destined to become\
5:48\
requires us to make choices\
to reject evil opposition that\
5:53\
tempts mortals to\
act contrary to God's\
5:56\
commandments and His plan.\
5:58\
It also requires\
that we be subject\
6:01\
to other mortal opposition,\
such as from the sins of others\
6:07\
or from some defects of birth.\
6:10\
Sometimes our needed\
growth is achieved better\
6:14\
by suffering and adversity than\
by comfort and tranquility.\
6:20\
And none of this\
mortal opposition\
6:23\
could achieve its\
eternal purpose\
6:25\
if divine intervention\
relieved us\
6:29\
from all the adverse\
consequences of mortality.\
6:35\
The plan reveals our destiny\
in eternity, the purpose\
6:40\
and conditions of our\
journey in mortality,\
6:43\
and the heavenly\
helps we will receive.\
6:47\
The commandments of God\
warn us against straying\
6:50\
into dangerous circumstances.\
6:53\
The teachings of inspired\
leaders guide our path\
6:57\
and give assurance that\
promotes our eternal journey.\
7:03\
God's plan gives us\
four great assurances\
7:07\
to assist our journey\
through mortality.\
7:10\
All are given to us through\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ,\
7:14\
the centerpiece of the plan.\
7:16\
The first assures us that\
through His suffering\
7:21\
for the sins of\
which we repent, we\
7:24\
can be cleansed of those sins.\
7:26\
Then the merciful final judge\
will "remember them no more."\
7:33\
Second, as part of our\
Savior's Atonement,\
7:37\
He took upon Him all\
other mortal infirmities.\
7:41\
This allows us to receive\
divine help and strength\
7:45\
to bear the inevitable\
burdens of mortality,\
7:49\
personal and general, such\
as war and pestilence.\
7:53\
The Book of Mormon provides our\
clearest scriptural description\
7:57\
of this essential\
power of the Atonement.\
8:00\
The Savior took upon\
Him "the pains and ...\
8:05\
sicknesses [and\
infirmities] of his people.\
8:08\
...\
8:09\
He will take upon him\
their infirmities,\
8:11\
that his bowels may be\
filled with mercy, according\
8:15\
to the flesh, that he may\
know according to the flesh\
8:19\
how to succor his\
people according\
8:21\
to their infirmities."\
8:26\
Third, the Savior, through\
His infinite Atonement,\
8:30\
revokes the finality\
of death and gives us\
8:33\
the joyful assurance that all\
of us will be resurrected.\
8:37\
The Book of Mormon teaches:\
"This restoration shall\
8:42\
come to all, both old and\
young, both bond and free,\
8:46\
both male and female, both\
the wicked and the righteous;\
8:50\
and even there shall not so\
much as a hair of their [head]\
8:54\
be lost; but every\
thing shall be\
8:56\
restored to its perfect frame."\
9:02\
We celebrate the reality of\
the Resurrection in this Easter\
9:06\
season.\
9:07\
This gives us the\
perspective and strength\
9:10\
to endure the mortal\
challenges faced by each of us\
9:13\
and those we love, such things\
as the physical, mental,\
9:18\
or emotional deficiencies we\
acquire at birth or experience\
9:23\
during our mortal lives.\
9:25\
Because of the\
Resurrection, we know\
9:28\
that these mortal deficiencies\
are only temporary!\
9:34\
The restored gospel assures\
us that the Resurrection can\
9:38\
include the opportunity\
to be with our family\
9:41\
members--husband, wife,\
children, and parents.\
9:45\
This is a powerful\
encouragement for us\
9:47\
to fulfill our family\
responsibilities in mortality.\
9:52\
It helps us live\
together in love\
9:55\
in this life in anticipation\
of joyful reunions\
10:00\
and associations in the next.\
10:04\
Fourth and finally,\
modern revelation\
10:07\
teaches us that our\
progress need not conclude\
10:11\
with the end of mortality.\
10:13\
Little has been revealed about\
this important assurance.\
10:17\
We are told that this life is\
the time to prepare to meet God\
10:23\
and that we should not\
procrastinate our repentance.\
10:28\
Still, we are taught\
that in the spirit world\
10:32\
the gospel is preached even to\
"the wicked and the disobedient\
10:37\
who had rejected the\
truth" and that those\
10:41\
taught there are capable\
of repentance in advance\
10:45\
of the Final Judgment.\
10:49\
Here are some other fundamentals\
of our Heavenly Father's plan.\
10:53\
The restored gospel\
of Jesus Christ\
10:56\
gives us a unique\
perspective on the subjects\
10:59\
of chastity, marriage, and\
the bearing of children.\
11:03\
It teaches that marriage\
according to God's plan\
11:07\
is necessary for accomplishing\
the purpose of God's plan,\
11:12\
to provide the divinely\
appointed setting\
11:14\
for mortal birth,\
and to prepare family\
11:17\
members for eternal life.\
11:19\
"Marriage is ordained of God\
unto man," the Lord said, "...\
11:25\
that the earth might answer\
the end of its creation."\
11:32\
In this His plan,\
of course, runs\
11:34\
counter to some strong worldly\
forces in law and custom.\
11:41\
The power to create mortal\
life is the most exalted power\
11:45\
God has given His children.\
11:48\
Its use was mandated in\
the first commandment\
11:52\
to Adam and Eve, but another\
important commandment\
11:55\
was given to forbid its misuse.\
11:58\
Outside the bonds of\
marriage, all uses\
12:02\
of the procreative power are to\
one degree or another a sinful\
12:07\
degrading and perversion of the\
most divine attribute of men\
12:11\
and women.\
12:13\
The emphasis the restored gospel\
places on this law of chastity\
12:18\
is because of the purpose\
of our procreative powers\
12:21\
in the accomplishment\
of God's plan.\
12:28\
During this 200th anniversary\
of the First Vision, which\
12:32\
initiated the Restoration,\
we know the Lord's plan,\
12:35\
and we are encouraged by two\
centuries of its blessings\
12:40\
through His restored Church.\
12:43\
In this year of\
2020, we have what\
12:48\
is popularly called 20/20 vision\
for the events of the past.\
12:55\
As we look to the future,\
however, our vision\
12:58\
is far less sure.\
12:59\
We know that two centuries after\
the Restoration, the spirit\
13:04\
world now includes many\
mortally experienced workers\
13:09\
to accomplish the preaching\
that occurs there.\
13:12\
We also know that we now\
have many more temples\
13:16\
to perform the ordinances of\
eternity for those who repent\
13:20\
and embrace the Lord's\
gospel on either side\
13:23\
of the veil of death.\
13:25\
All of this furthers our\
Heavenly Father's plan.\
13:29\
God's love is so great\
that except for the few who\
13:34\
deliberately become\
sons of perdition,\
13:37\
He has provided a destiny of\
glory for all of His children.\
13:43\
We know that the\
Savior will return\
13:45\
and that there will be a\
millennium of peaceful reign\
13:49\
to wrap up the mortal\
part of God's plan.\
13:52\
We also know that there will\
be different resurrections,\
13:56\
of the just and the unjust,\
with the final judgment\
14:00\
of each person always following\
his or her resurrection.\
14:07\
We will be judged\
according to our actions,\
14:10\
the desires of our hearts,\
and the kind of person\
14:13\
we have become.\
14:14\
This judgment will cause\
all of the children of God\
14:18\
to proceed to a kingdom of glory\
for which their obedience has\
14:23\
qualified them and where\
they will be comfortable.\
14:27\
The judge of all this is\
our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
14:32\
His omniscience gives\
Him a perfect knowledge\
14:35\
of all of our acts and\
desires, both those\
14:39\
unrepented or unchanged and\
those repented or righteous.\
14:44\
Therefore, after His\
judgment we will all\
14:47\
confess "that his\
judgments are just."\
14:53\
In conclusion, I\
share the conviction\
14:55\
that has come to me\
from many letters\
14:58\
and by reviewing many requests\
to return to the Church\
15:02\
after name removal or apostasy.\
15:06\
Many of our members do\
not fully understand\
15:10\
this plan of salvation,\
which answers\
15:13\
most questions\
about the doctrine\
15:15\
and inspired policies\
of the restored Church.\
15:19\
We who know God's plan and who\
have covenanted to participate\
15:24\
have a clear responsibility\
to teach these truths\
15:28\
and do all that we\
can to further them\
15:31\
for others and in our own\
circumstances in mortality.\
15:36\
I testify of Jesus Christ,\
our Savior and Redeemer,\
15:41\
who makes it all possible, in\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
