My beloved brothers\
and sisters, as we\
0:04\
come to the end of this\
historic conference,\
0:06\
we express our\
gratitude to the Lord.\
0:08\
The music has been sublime\
and the messages inspiring.\
0:13\
During this conference, we have\
experienced many highlights.\
0:17\
On this bicentennial\
anniversary,\
0:19\
we have introduced\
a proclamation\
0:21\
to the world\
declaring the reality\
0:22\
of the Restoration of the gospel\
of Jesus Christ in its fulness.\
0:27\
We commemorated the Restoration\
with the Hosanna Shout.\
0:31\
We unveiled a new symbol\
signifying our faith\
0:34\
in the Lord Jesus Christ\
and for visual recognition\
0:37\
of official Church\
information and materials.\
0:41\
We have called for a global\
day of fasting and prayer,\
0:44\
that the present pandemic\
may be controlled,\
0:47\
caregivers protected,\
the economy strengthened,\
0:52\
and life normalized.\
0:54\
This fast will be held\
on Good Friday, April 10.\
0:58\
What a great Friday\
that will be!\
1:01\
Next Sunday is Easter\
Sunday, when we will again\
1:04\
commemorate the Atonement and\
Resurrection of our Lord Jesus\
1:07\
Christ.\
1:09\
Because of His Atonement,\
His gift of resurrection\
1:12\
will come to all\
who have ever lived.\
1:14\
And His gift of\
eternal life will\
1:16\
come to all who\
qualify by fidelity\
1:20\
to ordinances and covenants\
made in His holy temples.\
1:24\
The many inspiring components\
of this April 2020 general\
1:28\
conference--and the sacred\
week that we now begin--can be\
1:32\
summarized by two divinely\
decreed words: "Hear Him."\
1:38\
We pray that your focus\
on Heavenly Father, who\
1:41\
spoke those words, and on His\
Beloved Son, Jesus Christ,\
1:45\
will loom largest in\
your memories of all\
1:48\
that has transpired.\
1:49\
We pray that you\
will begin anew truly\
1:53\
to hear, hearken to, and\
heed the words of the Savior.\
1:57\
I promise that decreased\
fear and increased faith\
2:01\
will follow.\
2:03\
Thank you for your\
desire to make your homes\
2:06\
true sanctuaries of faith,\
where the Spirit of the Lord\
2:09\
may dwell.\
2:11\
Our gospel study\
curriculum, Come, Follow Me,\
2:15\
will continue to\
bless your lives.\
2:17\
Your consistent efforts in this\
endeavor--even during those\
2:21\
moments when you feel that\
you are not being particularly\
2:24\
successful--will change your\
life, that of your family,\
2:28\
and the world.\
2:29\
We will be strengthened\
as we become\
2:32\
even more valiant\
disciples of the Lord,\
2:34\
standing up and speaking up\
for Him, wherever we are.\
2:39\
Now, let's talk about temples.\
2:42\
We have 168 dedicated\
temples across the world.\
2:46\
Others are at various stages\
of planning and construction.\
2:50\
When plans are announced\
to erect a new temple,\
2:53\
it becomes part of\
our sacred history.\
2:58\
It may seem odd to\
announce new temples\
3:01\
when all our temples\
are closed for a while.\
3:05\
More than a century ago,\
President Wilford Woodruff\
3:08\
foresaw conditions\
such as ours today,\
3:12\
as recorded in his dedicatory\
prayer of the Salt Lake Temple,\
3:16\
given in 1893.\
3:19\
Some of you may\
have seen excerpts\
3:21\
from this remarkable\
prayer on social media.\
3:25\
Hear these pleadings from\
a mighty prophet of God:\
3:30\
"When Thy people shall not have\
the opportunity of entering\
3:34\
this holy house ... and they\
are oppressed and in trouble,\
3:39\
surrounded by difficulties\
... and shall turn their faces\
3:43\
towards this ... holy house\
and ask Thee for deliverance,\
3:47\
for help, for Thy power to\
be extended in their behalf,\
3:52\
we beseech Thee, to look\
down from Thy holy habitation\
3:55\
in mercy ... and\
listen to their cries.\
3:59\
Or when the children of Thy\
people ... shall be separated,\
4:05\
through any cause,\
from this place, ...\
4:08\
and they shall cry unto\
Thee from the depths\
4:10\
of their affliction and\
sorrow to extend relief\
4:14\
and deliverance to them, we\
humbly entreat Thee to ...\
4:18\
hearken to their cries, and\
grant unto them the [blessing]\
4:23\
for which they ask."\
4:28\
Brothers and sisters,\
during times of our distress\
4:32\
when temples are\
closed, you can still\
4:35\
draw upon the power of your\
temple covenants and endowment\
4:40\
as you honor your covenants.\
4:42\
Please use this\
time when temples\
4:45\
are closed to continue to\
live a temple-worthy life\
4:49\
or to become temple worthy.\
4:52\
Talk about the temple with\
your family and friends.\
4:56\
Because Jesus Christ is at\
the center of everything\
4:59\
we do in the temple,\
as you think more\
5:02\
about the temple you will\
be thinking more about Him.\
5:06\
Study and pray to learn more\
about the power and knowledge\
5:10\
with which you have been\
endowed--or with which you will\
5:13\
yet be endowed.\
5:17\
Today we are pleased to\
announce plans to construct\
5:20\
eight new temples in\
the following locations:\
5:25\
Bahia Blanca,\
Argentina; Tallahassee,\
5:29\
Florida; Lubumbashi, Democratic\
Republic of the Congo;\
5:36\
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;\
Benin City, Nigeria; Syracuse,\
5:43\
Utah; Dubai, United\
Arab Emirates;\
5:52\
and Shanghai, People's\
Republic of China.\
5:58\
In all eight locations,\
Church architects\
6:01\
will work with local\
officials so that the temple\
6:05\
will harmonize with and\
be a beautiful addition\
6:07\
to each community.\
6:09\
The plan for a temple in\
Dubai comes in response\
6:14\
to their gracious invitation,\
which we gratefully\
6:17\
acknowledge.\
6:19\
Context for the plan for\
Shanghai is very important.\
6:25\
For more than two decades,\
temple-worthy members\
6:29\
in the People's\
Republic of China\
6:30\
have attended the Hong\
Kong China Temple.\
6:34\
But in July 2019,\
that temple was\
6:38\
closed for long-planned\
and much-needed renovation.\
6:42\
In Shanghai, a modest\
multipurpose meeting place\
6:47\
will provide a way\
for Chinese members\
6:50\
to continue to\
participate in ordinances\
6:52\
of the temple in the\
People's Republic of China\
6:56\
for them and their ancestors.\
7:00\
In every country, this\
Church teaches its members\
7:04\
to honor, obey, and\
sustain the law.\
7:07\
We teach the importance\
of the family,\
7:10\
of being good parents\
and exemplary citizens.\
7:13\
Because we respect the laws\
and regulations of the People's\
7:17\
Republic of China,\
the Church does not\
7:21\
send proselyting missionaries\
there, nor will we do so now.\
7:27\
Expatriate and\
Chinese congregations\
7:30\
will continue to\
meet separately.\
7:32\
The Church's legal status\
there remains unchanged.\
7:38\
In an initial phase\
of facility use,\
7:42\
entry will be by\
appointment only.\
7:45\
The Shanghai temple will\
not be a temple for tourists\
7:50\
from other countries.\
7:53\
These eight new temples will\
bless the lives of many people\
7:56\
on both sides of\
the veil of death.\
7:59\
Temples are a crowning part of\
the Restoration of the fulness\
8:03\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
8:05\
In God's goodness\
and generosity,\
8:08\
He is bringing the blessings\
of the temple closer\
8:11\
to His children everywhere.\
8:15\
As the Restoration\
continues, I know\
8:17\
God will continue to reveal\
many great and important things\
8:21\
pertaining to His\
kingdom here on earth.\
8:23\
That kingdom is The\
Church of Jesus Christ\
8:27\
of Latter-day Saints.\
8:29\
Dear brothers and sisters,\
I express my love for you.\
8:32\
During this time of\
tension and uncertainty,\
8:36\
invoking the authority\
vested in me,\
8:40\
I would like to confer upon\
you an apostolic blessing.\
8:45\
I bless you with peace and\
increasing faith in the Lord.\
8:50\
I bless you with\
a desire to repent\
8:52\
and become a little\
more like Him each day.\
8:56\
I bless you to know\
that the Prophet Joseph\
8:59\
Smith is the prophet of the\
Restoration of the gospel\
9:02\
of Jesus Christ in its fulness.\
9:06\
Should there be illness\
among you or your loved ones,\
9:10\
I leave a blessing of healing,\
consistent with the will\
9:13\
of the Lord.\
9:15\
I so bless you, adding once\
more my expression of love\
9:20\
for each of you, in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
