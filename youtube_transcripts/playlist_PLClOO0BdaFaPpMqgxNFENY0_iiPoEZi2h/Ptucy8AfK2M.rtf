Last October, I was assigned,\
0:04\
along with President M. Russell Ballard\
and Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,\
0:08\
to visit the United Kingdom,\
0:10\
where all three of us served\
as young missionaries.\
0:13\
We had the privilege of teaching\
and testifying,\
0:16\
as well as reliving early Church\
history in the British Isles,\
0:21\
where my great-great-grandfather,\
0:24\
Heber C. Kimball, and his associates\
were the first missionaries.\
0:30\
President Russell M. Nelson, teasing\
us about this assignment,\
0:35\
noted that it was unusual to assign\
three Apostles to visit\
0:40\
the area where they had served as\
missionaries in their youth.\
0:44\
He acknowledged that all desire to be\
assigned to visit their original\
0:49\
mission. With a big smile on his face,\
0:53\
he succinctly explained the precedent\
that if there is another set of three\
1:00\
Apostles who served in the same\
mission over 60 years ago,\
1:05\
then they also may receive\
a similar assignment.\
1:11\
In preparation for that assignment,\
1:13\
I reread “The Life of Heber C. Kimball,”\
written by a grandson, Orson F. Whitney,\
1:19\
who later was called to the Apostleship.\
1:22\
This volume was given to me\
by my precious mother when\
1:27\
I was almost seven years old.\
1:29\
We were preparing to attend the\
dedication of the This Is\
1:33\
the Place Monument on July 24, 1947,\
by President George Albert Smith.\
1:41\
She wanted me to know more about\
my ancestor, Heber C. Kimball.\
1:47\
This book contains a profound statement\
attributed to President Kimball that\
1:51\
has significance for our day.\
1:54\
Before sharing the statement, let\
me provide a little background.\
1:58\
While the Prophet Joseph Smith was\
incarcerated in Liberty Jail,\
2:03\
apostles Brigham Young\
and Heber C. Kimball\
2:05\
had the responsibility, under\
terrible adverse circumstances, of\
2:11\
overseeing the evacuation of\
the Saints from Missouri.\
2:16\
The evacuation was required\
in large part because of\
2:19\
the extermination order issued\
by Governor Lilburn W. Boggs.\
2:26\
Almost 30 years later, Heber C. Kimball,\
then in the First Presidency,\
2:32\
reflecting on this history with\
a new generation, taught,\
2:38\
“Let me say to you that many of you will\
see the time when you will have all\
2:43\
the trouble, trial, and persecution\
that you can stand,\
2:48\
and plenty of opportunities to show that\
you are true to God and His work.”\
2:55\
Heber continued, “To meet the\
difficulties that are coming,\
3:00\
it will be necessary for you to have a\
knowledge of the truth of this work\
3:05\
for yourselves. The difficulties will\
be of such a character that the man\
3:10\
or woman who does not possess this\
personal knowledge or witness will fall.\
3:16\
If you have not got the testimony, live\
right and call upon the Lord\
3:22\
and cease not until you attain it. If\
you do not, you will not stand. ...\
3:29\
The time will come when no man nor\
woman will be able to endure\
3:35\
on borrowed light. Each will have to be\
guided by the light within himself. ...\
3:41\
If you don’t have it,\
you will not stand;\
3:45\
therefore, seek for the testimony of\
Jesus and cleave to it, that when\
3:51\
the trying time comes, you may not\
stumble and fall,” end quote.\
3:57\
We each need a personal testimony\
of God's work and\
4:01\
the seminal role of Jesus Christ.\
4:04\
The 76th section of the Doctrine\
and Covenants refers to\
4:08\
the three degrees of glory and compares\
the Celestial Glory to\
4:11\
the sun. It then compares the\
Terrestrial Kingdom to the moon.\
4:17\
It is interesting the sun\
has its own light,\
4:21\
but the moon is reflected\
light or “borrowed light.”\
4:25\
Speaking of the Terrestrial Kingdom,\
verse 79 states,\
4:29\
“These are they who were not valiant\
in the testimony of Jesus.”\
4:35\
We cannot obtain the Celestial Kingdom\
and live with God the Father\
4:39\
on borrowed light. We need our own\
testimony of Jesus Christ and\
4:44\
His gospel. We live in a world\
where iniquity abounds\
4:48\
and hearts turn from God because\
of the precepts of men.\
4:52\
One of the most compelling examples in\
4:54\
the scriptures of Heber C. Kimball’s\
concerns about seeking\
4:58\
a testimony of God’s work\
5:00\
and Jesus Christ is set forth in Alma’s\
counsel to his three sons, Helaman,\
5:07\
Shiblon, and Corianton. Two of his sons\
had been true to God and His work,\
5:13\
but one son had made some bad decisions.\
5:16\
To me the greatest significance of\
Alma’s counsel is that he was imparting\
5:21\
it as a father for the benefit\
of his own children.\
5:25\
Alma’s first concern, like\
Heber C. Kimball’s,\
5:29\
was that each have a testimony of\
Jesus Christ and be true to God\
5:34\
and His work. In Alma’s remarkable\
teaching to his son Helaman,\
5:40\
he makes a profound promise that those\
who “put their trust in God shall be\
5:46\
supported in their trials, and their\
troubles, and their afflictions,\
5:51\
and shall be lifted up at the last day.”\
5:54\
While Alma had received a manifestation\
where he saw an angel,\
5:59\
this is rare. Impressions made by\
the Holy Ghost are more typical.\
6:04\
These impressions can be equally as\
important as angelic manifestations.\
6:10\
President Joseph Fielding Smith taught,\
“Impressions on the soul that come from\
6:14\
the Holy Ghost are far more\
significant than a vision.\
6:18\
When Spirit speaks to spirit,\
6:20\
the imprint upon the soul\
is far more difficult to erase.”\
6:27\
This leads us to Alma’s counsel\
to his second son, Shiblon.\
6:31\
Shiblon was righteous like\
his brother Helaman.\
6:35\
The counsel I want to emphasize is Alma\
38:12, which reads in part,\
6:41\
“see that ye bridle all your passions,\
that ye may be filled with love.”\
6:47\
“Bridle” is an interesting word.\
6:49\
When we ride a horse, we use\
the bridle to guide it.\
6:53\
A good synonym might be to direct,\
control, or restrain.\
6:58\
The Old Testament tells us we shouted\
7:00\
for joy when we learned we would have\
physical bodies. The body is not evil.\
7:06\
It is beautiful and essential.\
7:08\
But some passions, if not used properly\
and appropriately bridled,\
7:15\
can separate us from God and His work\
and adversely impact our testimony.\
7:21\
Let's talk about two passions\
in particular.\
7:24\
First, anger, and second, lust.\
7:26\
It is interesting that both left\
unbridled or uncontrolled\
7:30\
can cause great heartache,\
7:32\
diminish the influence of the Spirit,\
and separate us from God and His work.\
7:38\
The adversary takes every opportunity\
to fill our lives with images of\
7:42\
violence and immorality.\
In some families,\
7:47\
it is not uncommon for an angry husband\
or wife to hit a spouse or a child.\
7:52\
In July, I participated in\
7:54\
a United Kingdom All-Party Parliamentary\
Forum in London.\
7:58\
Violence against women and\
youth was highlighted as\
8:02\
a significant worldwide problem.\
8:06\
In addition to violence, others\
have engaged in verbal abuse.\
8:11\
The “Proclamation on the Family” tells\
us those “who abuse spouse\
8:15\
or offspring ... will one day stand\
accountable before God.”\
8:20\
President Nelson strongly emphasized\
this yesterday morning.\
8:26\
Please make up your mind that regardless\
of whether your parents did\
8:29\
or did not abuse you, you will\
not physically or verbally\
8:33\
or emotionally abuse your\
spouse or children.\
8:38\
In our day, one of the most significant\
challenges is contention\
8:41\
and verbal abuse related\
to societal issues.\
8:46\
In many cases, anger and abusive\
language have replaced reason,\
8:50\
discussion, and civility. Many have\
abandoned the admonition of the Savior’s\
8:56\
senior Apostle Peter to seek\
Christlike qualities such\
9:01\
as temperance, patience, godliness,\
brotherly kindness, and charity.\
9:06\
They have also abandoned the Christlike\
quality of humility.\
9:11\
In addition to controlling anger\
and bridling other passions,\
9:16\
we need to lead pure, moral lives\
by controlling our thoughts,\
9:21\
language, and actions. We need\
to avoid pornography,\
9:26\
evaluate the appropriateness of what\
we are streaming in our homes,\
9:32\
and avoid every form of sinful conduct.\
9:35\
This brings us to Alma’s counsel\
to his son Corianton.\
9:39\
Unlike his brothers, Helaman\
and Shiblon,\
9:42\
Corianton engaged in\
moral transgression.\
9:46\
Because Corianton had engaged\
in immorality,\
9:49\
it was necessary for Alma to\
teach him about repentance.\
9:53\
He had to teach him the seriousness\
of sin and then how to repent.\
9:58\
So Alma's preventive counsel\
was to bridle passions,\
10:03\
but, for those who have transgressed,\
to repent.\
10:08\
President Nelson gave members profound\
counsel on repentance at\
10:13\
the April 2019 general conference.\
10:17\
He made it clear that daily\
repentance is integral to our lives.\
10:22\
“Repentance is not an event;\
it is a process.\
10:25\
It is the key to happiness\
and peace of mind.”\
10:29\
He taught, “Daily repentance\
is the pathway to purity,\
10:33\
and purity brings power.” If Corianton\
had done what President Nelson\
10:38\
counseled, he would have\
repented as soon\
10:42\
as he had begun to entertain\
impure thoughts.\
10:45\
Major transgressions would\
not have occurred.\
10:49\
The concluding counsel that Alma\
gave to his sons is some of\
10:53\
the most important doctrine\
in all the scriptures.\
10:57\
It relates to the atonement\
wrought by Jesus Christ. Alma\
11:01\
testified that Christ would take away\
sin. Without the Savior’s Atonement,\
11:07\
the eternal principle of justice\
would require punishment.\
11:12\
Because of the Savior’s Atonement,\
11:14\
mercy can prevail for those who have\
repented and allow them to return to\
11:19\
the presence of God. We would do well\
to ponder this wonderful doctrine.\
11:25\
None can return to God by his\
or her own good works alone.\
11:30\
We all need the benefit of the Savior’s\
sacrifice. All have sinned,\
11:35\
and it is only through the Atonement of\
Jesus Christ that we can obtain mercy\
11:40\
and live with God. Alma also gave\
wonderful counsel to Corianton\
11:45\
for all of us who have or will go\
through the repentance process,\
11:50\
regardless of whether the sins\
are small or as severe\
11:54\
as those committed by Corianton.\
Verse 29 of Alma 42, reads,\
12:00\
“And now, my son, I desire that you\
should let these things trouble you no\
12:06\
more, and only let your sins trouble you\
with that trouble which shall bring\
12:11\
you down unto repentance.”\
12:13\
Corianted heeded Alma’s counsel and both\
repented and served honorably.\
12:20\
Because of the Savior’s Atonement,\
12:23\
healing is available to all. In\
Alma’s day, in Heber’s day,\
12:29\
and certainly in our day\
12:31\
we all need to seek our own testimony of\
Jesus Christ, bridle our passions,\
12:37\
repent of our sins, and\
find peace through\
12:41\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ and\
be true to God and His work.\
12:47\
In a recent talk and again this morning,\
12:50\
President Russell M. Nelson\
said it this way:\
12:53\
“I plead with you to take charge of\
your testimony of Jesus Christ.\
12:58\
Work for it. Own it. Care for it.\
Nurture it so that it will grow.\
13:03\
Then watch for miracles to happen\
in your life.” End of quote.\
13:09\
I am grateful that we will now\
hear from President Nelson.\
13:13\
I testify that President Nelson is\
the Lord’s prophet for our day.\
13:18\
I love and treasure the\
marvelous inspiration\
13:21\
and guidance we receive through him. As\
an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ,\
13:28\
I bear my sure witness of the\
Savior's divinity and\
13:32\
the reality of His Atonement. In the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
