Like many of you, I’ve been greatly\
influenced by Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf\
0:05\
over the years. That explains, at least\
in part, what I’m about to say.\
0:12\
So with apologies to him ...\
Well-trained airplane pilots\
0:21\
fly within the capacity\
of their aircraft\
0:24\
and follow directions from air traffic\
controllers regarding runway use\
0:28\
and flight path. Simply stated,\
0:31\
pilots operate within a framework.\
No matter how brilliant\
0:35\
or talented they are, only by flying\
within this framework can pilots safely\
0:41\
unleash the enormous potential of\
0:43\
an airplane to accomplish its\
miraculous objectives.\
0:47\
In a similar way, we receive personal\
revelation within a framework.\
0:54\
After baptism, we’re given a majestic\
yet practical gift,\
0:59\
the gift of the Holy Ghost. As we strive\
to stay on the covenant path, it is\
1:04\
“the Holy Ghost ... [that] will show\
[us] all things [that we] should do.”\
1:09\
When we’re unsure or uneasy,\
we can ask God for help. The\
1:16\
Savior’s promise could not be clearer:\
“Ask, and it shall be given you; ...\
1:22\
For everyone that asketh, receiveth.”\
1:26\
With the help of the Holy Ghost,\
1:28\
we can transform our divine nature\
into our eternal destiny.\
1:35\
The promise of personal revelation\
through the Holy Ghost is awe-inspiring,\
1:41\
much like an airplane in flight.\
1:44\
And like airplane pilots,\
1:46\
we need to understand the\
framework within which\
1:50\
the Holy Ghost functions to provide\
personal revelation.\
1:54\
When we operate within the framework,\
1:57\
the Holy Ghost can unleash astonishing\
insight, direction, and comfort.\
2:04\
Outside of that framework, no matter\
our brilliance or talent,\
2:09\
we can be deceived and crash and burn.\
2:14\
The scriptures form the first\
element of this framework\
2:18\
for personal revelation. Feasting on\
the words of Christ as found in\
2:22\
the scriptures stimulates\
personal revelation.\
2:26\
Elder Robert D. Hales said, “When we\
want to speak to God, we pray.\
2:32\
And when we want Him to speak to us,\
we search the scriptures.”\
2:38\
The scriptures also teach us how\
to receive personal revelation.\
2:42\
And we ask for what is right\
and good and not\
2:46\
for what is contrary to God's will.\
2:49\
We do not “ask amiss” with\
improper motives\
2:53\
to promote our own agenda or to\
fulfill our own pleasure. Above\
2:59\
all, we are to ask Heavenly Father\
in the name of Jesus Christ,\
3:03\
believing that we will receive.\
3:08\
A second element of the framework is\
that we receive personal revelation\
3:12\
only within our purview and not within\
the prerogative of others.\
3:19\
In other words, we take off and\
land in our appointed runway.\
3:25\
The importance of well-defined runways\
was learned early in the history of\
3:29\
the Restoration. Hiram Page,\
3:32\
one of the Eight Witnesses\
to the Book of Mormon,\
3:35\
claimed to be receiving revelations\
for the entire Church.\
3:39\
Several members were deceived\
and wrongly influenced.\
3:44\
In response, the Lord revealed that “no\
one shall be appointed to receive\
3:49\
commandments and revelations in this\
church excepting my servant\
3:53\
Joseph Smith, ... until I shall appoint\
... another in his stead.”\
4:00\
Doctrine, commandments, and revelations\
for the Church are\
4:05\
the prerogative of the living prophet,\
who receives them from\
4:08\
the Lord Jesus Christ. That’s\
the prophet’s runaway.\
4:14\
Years ago, I received a phone call from\
an individual who'd been arrested\
4:18\
for trespassing. He told me it had been\
revealed to him that additional\
4:25\
scripture was buried under the ground\
floor of a building he tried to enter.\
4:30\
He claimed that once he obtained\
the additional scripture,\
4:33\
he knew he would receive the\
gift of translation,\
4:36\
bring forth new scripture, and shape\
the doctrine and direction of\
4:41\
the Church. I told him\
that he was mistaken,\
4:46\
and he implored me to pray about it.\
I told him I wouldn't.\
4:52\
He became verbally abusive\
and ended the phone call.\
4:57\
I didn't need to pray about this\
request for one simple\
5:00\
but profound reason: only the prophet\
receives revelation for the Church.\
5:07\
It would be “contrary to\
the economy of God”\
5:10\
for others to receive such revelation,\
which belongs on the prophet’s runway.\
5:17\
Personal revelation rightly\
belongs to individuals.\
5:21\
You can receive revelation, for example,\
where to live,\
5:25\
what career path to follow,\
or whom to marry.\
5:29\
Church leaders may teach doctrine\
and share inspired counsel,\
5:33\
but the responsibility for these\
decisions rests with you.\
5:38\
That's your revelation to receive.\
That's your runway.\
5:44\
A third element of the framework is that\
personal revelation will be in\
5:48\
harmony with the commandments of God and\
the covenants we've made with Him.\
5:54\
Consider a prayer that goes something\
like this: “Heavenly Father,\
6:00\
Church services are boring. May\
I worship Thee on the Sabbath\
6:06\
in the mountains or on the beach?\
6:09\
May I be excused from going to church\
and partaking of the sacrament,\
6:12\
but still have the promised blessings\
of keeping the Sabbath day holy?”\
6:18\
In response to such a prayer, we can\
anticipate God’s response: “My child,\
6:26\
I’ve already revealed my will\
regarding the Sabbath day.”\
6:31\
When we ask for revelation about\
something God has already given clear\
6:36\
direction, we open ourselves up to\
misinterpreting our feelings\
6:41\
and hearing what we want to hear.\
6:45\
A man once told me about his struggles\
to stabilize his family's financial\
6:49\
situation. He had the idea to embezzle\
funds as a solution, prayed about it,\
6:56\
and felt he had received affirmative\
revelation to do so.\
7:01\
I knew he had been deceived because\
he sought revelation\
7:05\
contrary to a prophet, contrary\
to a commandment of God.\
7:11\
The prophet Joseph Smith warned:\
7:14\
“Nothing is a greater injury to the\
children of men than to be under\
7:19\
the influence of a false spirit, when\
they think they have the spirit of God.”\
7:25\
Some might point out\
that Nephi violated\
7:29\
a commandment when he slew Laban.\
7:31\
However, this exception does\
not negate the rule—\
7:35\
the rule that personal revelation will\
be in harmony with God’s commandments.\
7:41\
No simple explanation of this episode\
is completely satisfactory,\
7:46\
but let me highlight some aspects.\
7:48\
The episode didn't begin with Nephi\
asking if he could slay Laban.\
7:53\
It wasn't something he wanted to do.\
7:56\
Killing Laban was not for\
Nephi’s personal benefit,\
8:00\
but to provide scriptures to a future\
nation and a covenant people.\
8:05\
And Nephi was sure that\
it was revelation—\
8:09\
in fact, in this case, it was\
a commandment from God.\
8:15\
The fourth element of the framework is\
to recognize what God has already\
8:19\
revealed to you personally while being\
open to further revelation from Him.\
8:25\
If God has answered a question and the\
circumstances haven’t changed,\
8:31\
why would we expect the answer\
to be different?\
8:35\
Joseph Smith stumbled into this\
problematic scenario in 1828.\
8:40\
The first portion of the Book of Mormon\
had been translated when Martin Harris,\
8:45\
a benefactor and early scribe,\
8:47\
asked Joseph for permission to\
take the translated pages\
8:51\
and show them to his wife. Unsure what\
to do, Joseph prayed for guidance.\
8:59\
The Lord told him not to let\
Martin take the pages.\
9:04\
Martin requested that Joseph, ask\
God again. Joseph did so.\
9:10\
And the answer was, not surprisingly,\
the same.\
9:14\
But Martin begged Joseph to ask a\
third time, and Joseph did so.\
9:20\
This time God didn’t say, “No.”\
9:24\
Instead, it was as though God said,\
“Joseph, you know how I feel about this,\
9:30\
but you have your agency to choose.”\
9:34\
Feeling himself relieved\
of the constraint,\
9:37\
Joseph decided to allow Martin\
to take 116 manuscript pages\
9:42\
and show them to a few family members.\
9:45\
The translated pages were lost\
and never recovered.\
9:50\
The Lord severely rebuked Joseph.\
9:54\
Joseph learned as the Book of Mormon\
prophet Jacob taught: “seek not to\
10:00\
counsel the Lord, but to take\
counsel from his hand.\
10:04\
For ... he counseleth in wisdom.”\
10:07\
Jacob cautioned that unfortunate\
things happen when we ask\
10:11\
for things we should not.\
10:13\
He foretold that the people\
in Jerusalem would seek\
10:16\
“for things that they could\
not understand,”\
10:18\
look “beyond the mark,” and completely\
overlook the Savior of the world.\
10:23\
They stumbled because they asked\
for things they would not\
10:28\
and could not understand.\
10:31\
If we have received personal revelation\
for our situation and\
10:35\
the circumstances haven’t changed, God\
has already answered our question.\
10:41\
For example, we sometimes\
ask repeatedly\
10:45\
for reassurance that we've\
been forgiven.\
10:49\
If we’ve repented, been filled with joy\
and peace of conscience, and received\
10:55\
a remission of our sins, we\
don’t need to ask again\
11:00\
but can trust the answer\
God has already given.\
11:04\
Even as we trust God's prior answers,\
11:07\
we need to be open to further\
personal revelation.\
11:11\
After all, few of life's destinations\
are reached via a nonstop flight.\
11:17\
We should recognize that personal\
revelation may be received “line upon\
11:21\
line and precept upon precept,”\
that revealed direction can be\
11:27\
and frequently is incremental.\
11:30\
The elements of the framework for\
personal revelation are overlapping\
11:36\
and mutually reinforcing.\
11:38\
But within that framework,\
11:40\
the Holy Ghost can and will reveal\
everything we need to soar onto\
11:46\
and maintain momentum on\
the covenant path.\
11:50\
Thus we can be blessed by\
11:51\
the power of Jesus Christ to become what\
Heavenly Father wants us to be.\
11:57\
I invite you to have the confidence to\
claim personal revelation for yourself,\
12:04\
understanding what God has revealed\
consistent with the scriptures and\
12:08\
the commandments He’s given through\
His appointed prophets,\
12:11\
and within your own purview and agency.\
12:15\
I know that the Holy Ghost can\
12:18\
and will show you all things that you\
should do.\
12:22\
In the name of Jesus christ, Amen.\
12:25\
Amen.\
