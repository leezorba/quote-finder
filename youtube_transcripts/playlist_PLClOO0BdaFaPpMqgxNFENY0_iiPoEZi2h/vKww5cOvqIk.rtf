In 1982, I was finishing my associate\
degree in topography at\
0:06\
a technical school. At\
the end of the year,\
0:09\
a classmate invited me to\
have a conversation.\
0:12\
I remember that we left the other\
members of the class and went to\
0:17\
an area beside the sport courts.\
0:20\
When we got there, he spoke to me\
about his religious convictions,\
0:25\
and not only did he show me a book,\
but he gave me the book.\
0:30\
Honestly, I do not remember all\
the words that he said,\
0:34\
but I remember that moment very well\
and the way I felt when he said,\
0:41\
“I want to bear my testimony to you\
that this book is true and that\
0:46\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
has been restored.”\
0:50\
After our conversation, I went home,\
turned a few pages in the book,\
0:55\
and placed it on a shelf. Because we\
were at the end of the year\
1:00\
and it was my last year of\
my topography degree,\
1:04\
I did not really pay much\
attention to the book,\
1:07\
nor to my classmate who\
had shared it with me.\
1:11\
The name of the book, you can already\
guess. Yes, it was the Book of Mormon.\
1:18\
Five months later, the missionaries\
came into my house.\
1:21\
They were leaving just as I was coming\
home from work.\
1:26\
I invited them back in. We sat down in\
1:30\
the little bit patio in\
front of my house.\
1:34\
And they taught me.\
In my search for the truth,\
1:39\
I asked them which church was true\
and how I could find it.\
1:44\
The missionaries taught me that\
I could obtain that answer\
1:48\
for myself. With great expectation\
and desire,\
1:52\
I accepted the challenge to read several\
chapters from the Book of Mormon.\
1:58\
I prayed with a sincere heart\
and with real intent.\
2:03\
The answer to my question was clear.\
And several days later—\
2:09\
more precisely on May 1, 1983—\
2:14\
I was baptized and confirmed\
a member of\
2:18\
The Church of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints. Today,\
2:23\
when I think about the sequence\
of events that occurred,\
2:26\
I see clearly how important\
2:28\
the courage of my classmate was when\
he bore his testimony about\
2:33\
the restored truth and presented\
me with the tangible proof of\
2:39\
the Restoration of the gospel\
of Jesus Christ,\
2:42\
even the Book of Mormon.\
That simple act,\
2:47\
but of profound significance to me,\
2:50\
created a connection between\
me and the missionaries\
2:53\
when I met them. The truth had been\
presented to me, and after my baptism,\
2:59\
I became a disciple of Jesus Christ.\
3:03\
During the following years,\
3:05\
and with the help of a very special\
people such as leaders, teachers,\
3:11\
friends, and also through\
my own personal study,\
3:15\
I learned that when I decided to\
be a disciple of Jesus Christ,\
3:19\
I had accepted the task of not only\
defending the truth,\
3:23\
but also to proclaim it. When we agree\
to believe in the truth, to follow it,\
3:31\
and when we make an effort to become\
true disciples of Jesus Christ,\
3:36\
we do not receive a certificate with\
3:38\
a guarantee that we will\
not make mistakes,\
3:41\
that we will not be tempted\
to walk away from\
3:43\
the truth, that \
we will not be criticized,\
3:46\
or even that we will not experience\
afflictions. But the knowledge of\
3:52\
the truth teaches that when we enter\
the strait and narrow path\
3:57\
that will take us back to the presence\
of the Heavenly Father,\
4:02\
there will always be “a way\
to escape” these problems.\
4:06\
There will always be the possibility of\
4:10\
doubting our doubts before\
doubting our faith.\
4:13\
And finally, we have a guarantee that we\
will never be alone when we go through\
4:18\
afflictions, for God visits His people\
in the midst of their afflictions.\
4:26\
Once we learn the truth,\
the Lord gives us\
4:28\
the opportunity to do what He would\
do if He were here today.\
4:33\
Truly, He showed us by His teachings\
that we must do:\
4:39\
“And ye shall go forth in\
the power of my Spirit,\
4:43\
preaching my gospel, two by two, in\
my name, lifting up your voices as\
4:49\
with the sound of a trumpet, declaring\
my word like unto angels of God.”\
4:56\
The opportunity for missionary service\
in our youth is unique!\
5:01\
Please, young man, do not postpone your\
preparation to serve the Lord\
5:06\
as missionaries as you face situations\
that may make the decision to serve\
5:10\
a mission a difficult one, such as\
interrupting your study for a time,\
5:16\
saying goodbye to your girlfriend\
without any guarantee that you will ever\
5:20\
date her again, or even having\
to walk away from a job.\
5:26\
Remember the Savior’s example.\
5:28\
During His ministry, He likewise faced\
difficulty, including criticism,\
5:34\
persecution, and ultimately the bitter\
cup of His atoning sacrifice.\
5:40\
Yet in all circumstances,\
5:43\
He sought to do the will of His\
Father and give glory to Him.\
5:49\
Young women, you are very welcome if you\
so desire to work in the vineyard of\
5:54\
the Lord, and as you prepare yourselves\
to serve as full-time missionaries,\
5:59\
you will not be exempted from\
6:01\
the same challenges. To all\
who decide to serve Him,\
6:06\
I promise you that the 24 or 18 months\
of service will pass in\
6:12\
the mission field just as they\
would pass if you stayed home.\
6:17\
But the opportunities that\
await the worthy\
6:20\
young men and young women\
6:22\
of this Church in the\
mission field are unique.\
6:27\
The privilege of representing\
6:29\
the Savior Jesus Christ and His\
Church cannot be ignored.\
6:34\
Participating in countless prayers,\
developing and bearing your\
6:38\
testimonies several times\
during the day,\
6:40\
many hours of scripture study, meeting\
people whom you would never meet if\
6:47\
you stayed home are\
indescribable experiences.\
6:52\
The same level of experience is\
reserved for the youth whom\
6:57\
the Lord calls to serve\
on service missions.\
7:01\
You are very welcomed and necessary.\
7:04\
Please, do not minimize the importance\
of a service mission,\
7:09\
for service missions also provide\
indescribable experiences.\
7:16\
“The worth of souls is great in\
the sight of God,”\
7:22\
including the worth of your soul.\
7:26\
Upon returning from your service,\
7:28\
perhaps your girlfriend or boyfriend\
is no longer waiting for you,\
7:32\
but you have learned very well how\
to make effective contacts.\
7:39\
Your academic study will\
make more sense with\
7:42\
the glimpses you have had about\
preparing more adequately for\
7:46\
the workplace. And finally,\
7:48\
you have the full certainty of\
having courageously proclaimed\
7:54\
the gospel of peace, testifying\
about the restored truth.\
7:59\
For those of you who are married and\
in different stages of your life,\
8:05\
you are very necessary in\
the work of the Lord.\
8:08\
Prepare yourselves, live healthy\
lives, seeking for temporal\
8:13\
and spiritual self-reliance,\
8:16\
because the opportunities to do what\
the Lord would do for His children\
8:21\
are not limited to one age group.\
8:25\
The most delightful experience\
my wife and\
8:28\
I have had in recent years have come\
while serving alongside special\
8:34\
couples in special places\
8:40\
and serving very special people.\
8:43\
The experience I had at the end of my\
topography degree taught me that we\
8:48\
always defend the truth when we proclaim\
it and that defending\
8:53\
the truth is a proactive thing.\
8:57\
The defense of the truth should never\
be done in an aggressive manner,\
9:02\
but rather with genuine\
interest to love,\
9:06\
share, and invite the people we are\
testifying to about the truth,\
9:12\
thinking only about the temporal\
and spiritual welfare of\
9:16\
the children of a loving\
Heavenly Father.\
9:20\
In general conference of October\
2021, President Russell M. Nelson,\
9:26\
our beloved Prophet, taught:\
9:29\
“Contrary to [what some think], there\
really is [what we call] right and\
9:35\
wrong. There really [does exist] an\
absolute truth, an eternal truth.”\
9:39\
The holy scriptures teach that\
“truth is knowledge of things\
9:44\
as they are, and as they were,\
and as they are to come.”\
9:50\
The knowledge of the truth does not\
make us better than other people,\
9:53\
but it teaches what we must do\
to return to God's presence.\
9:59\
As you proceed firmly in Christ\
and with courage\
10:02\
not only to proclaim the truth,\
but to live the truth,\
10:06\
you will find comfort and peace during\
the turbulence that you shall encounter\
10:11\
in these days. The challenges\
of life can knock us down,\
10:15\
but know that when we exercise\
faith in Jesus Christ,\
10:19\
“[our] afflictions shall be but a small\
moment” in the grand scope of eternity.\
10:25\
Please do not create a deadline for\
the end of your difficulties\
10:29\
and challenges. Trust in Heavenly\
Father and do not give up.\
10:34\
For if we do give up, we\
will never know how\
10:38\
the end of our journey would have\
been in the kingdom of God.\
10:42\
Hold on to the truth, learning\
from the sources of the truth:\
10:47\
The scriptures. The words of the\
prophets. The Holy Ghost.\
10:53\
I bear my testimony of Jesus Christ\
and that this is His Church.\
10:59\
We have a living prophet and we will\
always feel free when we proclaim\
11:05\
the truth with courage. In the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
