During the Savior’s early ministry,\
He noticed a man who was blind.\
0:07\
Jesus’s disciples asked, “Master,\
0:11\
who did sin, this man, or his parents,\
that he was born blind?”\
0:16\
The Savior’s firm, loving,\
and sincere answer\
0:20\
reassures us that He is mindful\
of our struggles:\
0:25\
“Neither hath this man sinned\
nor his parents;\
0:29\
but that the works of God should\
be made manifest in him.”\
0:34\
While some challenges may come because\
of willful disobedience,\
0:38\
we know that many of life's challenges\
come because of other reasons.\
0:45\
Whatever the source of our challenges,\
0:47\
they can be a golden opportunity\
to grow.\
0:52\
Our family has not been spared\
the adversities of life.\
0:57\
Growing up, I admired large families.\
1:00\
Such families felt appealing to me,\
1:03\
especially when I found a church in my\
teens through my maternal uncle, Sarfo,\
1:10\
and his wife in Takoradi, Ghana.\
1:14\
When Hannah and I were married,\
1:16\
we desired the fulfillment of\
our patriarchal blessings,\
1:21\
which indicated that we would be\
blessed with many children.\
1:27\
However, prior to the birth\
of our third boy,\
1:31\
it became medically clear that Hannah\
would not be able to have another baby.\
1:38\
Gratefully, though Kenneth was born in\
1:41\
a life-threatening situation\
to both him and his mother,\
1:45\
he arrived safely and his\
mother recovered.\
1:49\
He was able to begin to fully\
participate in our family life,\
1:54\
including church attendance, daily\
family prayers, scripture study, home\
2:00\
evening, and wholesome recreational\
activities.\
2:05\
Though we had to adjust our expectations\
of a large family,\
2:09\
it was a joy to put into practice\
the teachings from “The Family:\
2:15\
a Proclamation to the World” with our\
three beloved children.\
2:20\
Following those teachings added much\
meaning to my growing faith.\
2:27\
As the proclamation states, open quote:\
2:29\
“Marriage between man and woman is\
essential to His eternal plan.\
2:36\
Children are entitled to birth\
within the bonds of matrimony,\
2:40\
and to be reared by a father and\
2:43\
a mother who honor marital vows with\
complete fidelity,” close quote.\
2:49\
As we put these principles into\
practice, we were blessed.\
2:55\
However, one weekend, during my\
service as a stake president,\
3:00\
we experienced perhaps the worst\
trial a parent can face.\
3:07\
Our family returned from a church\
activity and gathered for lunch.\
3:12\
Then our three boys went out within\
our compound to play.\
3:18\
My wife felt repeated impressions\
that something might be wrong.\
3:24\
She asked me to check on the children\
while we were washing the dishes.\
3:30\
I felt they were safe since we could\
hear their voices of excitement from\
3:36\
their play. When we both finally\
went to check on our sons,\
3:42\
to our dismay, we found little 18-\
month-old Kenneth helpless in\
3:49\
a bucket of water unseen\
by his brothers.\
3:54\
We rushed him to the hospital, but all\
attempts to revive him proved futile.\
4:00\
We were devastated that we would\
not be able—we would not have\
4:05\
the opportunity to raise our precious\
child during this mortal life.\
4:11\
Though we knew Kenneth would be\
part of our family eternally,\
4:15\
I found myself questioning why God would\
let this tragedy happen to me when\
4:20\
I was doing all I could\
to magnify my calling.\
4:24\
I had just come home from\
fulfilling one of my duties in\
4:30\
ministering to the Saints.\
4:32\
Why couldn't God look upon my\
service and save our son\
4:36\
and our family from this tragedy?\
4:40\
The more I thought about it,\
the more bitter I became.\
4:44\
My wife never blamed me for not\
responding to her promptings.\
4:50\
But I learned a life-changing lesson and\
made two rules never to be broken.\
4:59\
Rule number one, listen to and heed\
the promptings of your wife.\
5:07\
Rule number two, if you are\
not sure for any reason,\
5:12\
refer to rule number one.\
5:17\
Though the experience was shattering\
and we continue to grieve,\
5:22\
our overwhelming burden\
was eventually eased.\
5:26\
My wife and I learned lessons, specific\
lessons from our loss.\
5:32\
We came to feel united and bound\
by our temple covenants.\
5:38\
We know we can claim Kenneth as ours in\
the next world because he was born in\
5:45\
the covenant. We also gained experience\
necessary to minister to others\
5:51\
and empathize with their pain.\
5:55\
I testify that our bitterness\
has since dispersed\
6:00\
as we exercised faith in the Lord.\
6:04\
Our experience continues to be hard,\
6:07\
but we have learned with the Apostle\
Paul that we “can do all things through\
6:13\
Christ, which [strengthens\
us]” if we focus on Him.\
6:20\
President Russell M. Nelson taught, open\
quote: “When the focus of our lives is\
6:26\
on God’s plan of salvation ... and\
Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can\
6:32\
feel joy regardless of what is happening\
—or not happening—in our lives.”\
6:40\
He further said, “Joy comes from and\
because of Him,” close quote.\
6:47\
We can be of good cheer and be filled\
with peace in our tough times.\
6:54\
The love we feel because of the Savior\
and His Atonement becomes\
6:58\
a powerful resource to us\
in our trying moments.\
7:02\
“All that is unfair and difficult about\
life can be made right through\
7:08\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.”\
He commanded,\
7:12\
“In the world ye shall have tribulation:\
but be of good cheer;\
7:18\
I have overcome the world.”\
7:21\
He can help us endure whatever pain,\
7:24\
sickness, and trial we face\
in mortality.\
7:28\
We find many scripture stories of great\
and noble leaders such as Jeremiah,\
7:34\
Job, Joseph Smith, and Nephi,\
7:37\
who are not spared from the struggles\
and challenges of mortality.\
7:42\
They were mortals who learned\
to obey the Lord\
7:46\
even in harsh conditions. During the\
terrible days in Liberty jail,\
7:51\
Joseph Smith cried out, “O God,\
where art thou?\
7:56\
And where is the pavilion that\
covereth thy hiding place?”\
8:01\
The Lord told Joseph to “endure it\
well,” and promised that if he did,\
8:06\
all these things would give him\
experience and would be for his good.\
8:13\
Reflecting on my own experiences,\
8:16\
I realized I have learned some\
of my best lessons during\
8:20\
the hardest times in my life, times that\
took me out of my comfort zone.\
8:28\
Difficulties I encountered as\
a youth while learning about\
8:31\
the Church through seminary,\
as a recent convert, and as\
8:36\
a full-time missionary, and challenges\
I faced in my education,\
8:41\
in striving to magnify my callings,\
and in raising\
8:45\
a family have prepared\
me for the future.\
8:49\
The more I cheerfully respond to\
difficult circumstances with faith in\
8:54\
the Lord, the more I grow\
in my discipleship.\
8:58\
The hard things in our\
lives should come\
9:01\
as no surprise once we have entered\
the strait and narrow path.\
9:06\
Jesus Christ learned “obedience by\
the things which He suffered.”\
9:12\
As we follow Him, especially\
in our difficult times,\
9:16\
we can grow to become more like Him.\
9:20\
One of the covenants we make with the\
Lord in the temple is to live\
9:24\
the law of sacrifice. Sacrifice\
has always been part of\
9:28\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
9:31\
It is a reminder of the great atoning\
sacrifice of Jesus Christ for all who\
9:38\
have lived or will live on earth.\
9:42\
I know that the Lord always compensates\
our righteous desires.\
9:50\
Remember the many children I was\
promised in my patriarchal blessing?\
9:55\
That blessing is being fulfilled.\
My wife and I\
9:59\
served with several hundred\
missionaries from more than 25\
10:06\
countries in the Ghana\
Cape Coast Mission.\
10:09\
They are as dear to us as if they\
were literally our own children.\
10:16\
I testify that we grow in our\
discipleship when we exercise faith in\
10:24\
the Lord during difficult times.\
10:27\
As we do so, He will mercifully\
strengthen us\
10:31\
and help us carry our burdens. In\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
