A few years ago, I had a life-\
changing experience during\
0:05\
a sacrament meeting in our\
home ward in Arizona.\
0:08\
As the sacrament prayer indicated our\
0:10\
willingness to “take upon [ourselves]\
the name of Jesus Christ,”\
0:15\
the Holy Ghost reminded me that\
Jesus has many names.\
0:20\
This question then came to my heart:\
0:22\
“Which of Jesus’s names should I\
take upon myself this week?”\
0:28\
Three names came to my mind,\
and I wrote them down.\
0:31\
Each of those three names contained\
Christlike attributes that\
0:35\
I wanted to develop more fully.\
0:37\
In the week that followed,\
0:38\
I focused on those three names\
0:40\
and tried to embrace their\
corresponding attributes\
0:42\
and characteristics. Since that time,\
0:45\
I’ve continued to ask that question\
as part of my personal worship:\
0:49\
“Which of Jesus’s names should I\
take upon myself this week?”\
0:55\
Answering that question and\
striving to develop\
0:57\
the related Christlike attributes\
has blessed my life.\
1:01\
In His great intercessory prayer,\
1:02\
Jesus expressed this important truth:\
1:05\
“And this is life eternal, that\
they might know thee\
1:09\
the only true God, and Jesus Christ,\
whom thou has sent.”\
1:13\
Today, I'd like to share\
with you the blessings\
1:15\
and power that come from knowing\
Jesus Christ by His many names.\
1:21\
One simple way we get to know someone\
is by learning their name.\
1:24\
It's been said that a person's name\
is to that person the sweetest\
1:29\
and most important sound\
in any language.\
1:32\
Have you ever had the experience of\
calling someone by the wrong name\
1:35\
or forgetting their name?\
1:37\
My wife, Alexis, and I have\
1:39\
on occasion called one\
of our children Lola.\
1:42\
Unfortunately, as you may have guessed,\
Lola is our dog.\
1:48\
For better or worse, forgetting\
someone's name communicates to that\
1:52\
person that you probably don't\
know them very well.\
1:55\
Jesus knew and called people\
by name. To ancient Israel\
1:59\
the Lord said, “Fear not: for\
I have redeemed thee,\
2:02\
I have called thee by thy name;\
thou art mine.”\
2:08\
On Easter morning, Mary's witness of\
2:09\
the resurrected Christ was solidified\
when Jesus called her by name.\
2:14\
Likewise, God called Joseph Smith by\
name in answer to his prayer of faith.\
2:20\
In some cases, Jesus gave His disciples\
new names that were indicative of\
2:25\
their nature, capacity, and potential.\
2:27\
Jehovah gave Jacob the\
new name of Israel,\
2:30\
which means “One who prevails with\
God” or “let God prevail.”\
2:36\
Jesus gave James and John\
the name of Boanerges,\
2:39\
which meant “the sons of thunder.”\
2:42\
Seeing his future leadership, Jesus gave\
Simon the name of Cephas or Peter,\
2:48\
which means “a rock.” Just as Jesus\
knows each of us by name,\
2:54\
one way we can come to better know Jesus\
is by learning His many names.\
2:59\
Like the names of Israel and Peter, many\
3:01\
of Jesus’s names are titles that help\
us understand His mission, purpose,\
3:08\
character, and attributes.\
3:10\
As we come to know Jesus's many names,\
3:13\
we will come to better understand\
His divine mission\
3:16\
and His selfless character.\
3:19\
Knowing His many names also inspires\
us to become more like Him,\
3:23\
to develop Christlike attributes that\
bring joy and purpose to our lives.\
3:29\
A few years ago, President Russell\
M. Nelson studied all\
3:32\
the scriptures concerning Jesus\
Christ in the Topical Guide.\
3:35\
He then invited young adults to study\
these same scriptures. Concerning\
3:41\
Jesus’s many names, President Nelson\
said, “Study everything\
3:46\
Jesus Christ is by prayerfully\
3:49\
and vigorously seeking to understand\
what each of His various titles\
3:55\
and names means personally for you.”\
3:58\
Following President Nelson's invitation,\
4:00\
I began developing my own list\
of Jesus's many names.\
4:04\
My personal list now has over 300 names,\
4:06\
and I'm sure there are many more\
that I haven't discovered yet.\
4:10\
While there are some of Jesus’s names\
that are reserved only for Him,\
4:14\
I would like to share five names\
4:17\
and titles that have application\
to each of us.\
4:21\
I invite you to develop your own list\
4:23\
as you come to know Jesus\
by His many names.\
4:26\
In doing so, you will find that there\
are other names along with their\
4:30\
corresponding Christlike attributes\
that you will want to take upon\
4:34\
yourself as Jesus's covenant disciple.\
First, Jesus is the Good Shepherd.\
4:42\
As such, Jesus knows His sheep,\
“calleth His own sheep by name,”\
4:46\
and, as the Lamb of God, gave\
His life for His sheep.\
4:51\
Similarly, Jesus wants us\
to be good shepherds,\
4:55\
particularly in our families and as\
ministering brothers and sisters.\
4:59\
One way we demonstrate our love for\
Jesus is by feeding His sheep.\
5:03\
For those sheep who may be wandering,\
5:05\
good shepherds go into the wilderness\
to find the lost sheep\
5:08\
and then stay with them until\
they return to safety.\
5:12\
As good shepherds and as local\
conditions permit,\
5:15\
we should seek to spend more time\
ministering to people in their homes.\
5:20\
In our ministering, texting\
5:21\
and technology should\
be used to enhance\
5:24\
but not replace personal contact.\
5:27\
Second, Jesus is the High Priest of Good\
Things to Come. Knowing that His\
5:33\
crucifixion was just hours away,\
Jesus said: “These things\
5:37\
I have spoken unto you, that in me ye\
might have peace. In the world\
5:43\
ye shall have tribulation:\
but be of good cheer;\
5:47\
I have overcome the world.” Today, as\
our world is frequently polarized\
5:52\
and divided, there is a great\
need for us to preach\
5:56\
and practice positivity,\
optimism, and hope.\
6:00\
Despite any challenges in our past,\
faith always points toward the future,\
6:04\
filled with hope, allowing us to fulfill\
Jesus’s invitation to be of\
6:08\
good cheer. Joyfully living\
6:10\
the gospel helps us to become disciples\
of good things to come.\
6:16\
Another of Jesus’s titles is that He is\
The Same Yesterday, Today, and Forever.\
6:24\
Consistency is a Christlike attribute.\
6:27\
Jesus always did His Father’s will,\
6:30\
and His arm is constantly\
outstretched to save,\
6:33\
help, and heal us. As we are more\
consistent in living\
6:37\
the gospel, we’ll become\
more like Jesus.\
6:40\
Although the world will experience\
large swings in its pendulums of\
6:44\
popularity as people are\
tossed to and fro\
6:47\
and carried about with every\
wind of doctrine,\
6:49\
consistent gospel living helps us to\
be steadfast and immovable during\
6:55\
the storms of life. We can also\
demonstrate consistency by accepting\
6:59\
President Nelson's invitation\
to make time for the Lord.\
7:03\
Great spiritual strength\
comes from small\
7:07\
and simple things, like developing\
holy habits\
7:10\
and righteous routines of daily prayer,\
repentance, scripture\
7:14\
study, and service to others.\
7:17\
Fourth, Jesus is the Holy one of Israel.\
7:20\
Jesus's life was a pattern of holiness.\
7:24\
As we follow Jesus, we can become\
a holy one in Israel.\
7:30\
We increase in holiness as we regularly\
visit the temple where “Holiness to\
7:35\
the Lord” is etched\
above every entrance.\
7:38\
Every time we worship in\
the temple, we leave\
7:41\
endowed with greater power to make\
our homes places of holiness.\
7:47\
For any who do not currently have a\
recommend to enter the holy temple,\
7:51\
I invite you to meet with your bishop\
and prepare yourself to enter\
7:56\
or return to that holy place.\
7:59\
Time in the temple will increase\
holiness in our lives.\
8:03\
One last name of Jesus is that\
He is Faithful and True.\
8:09\
Just as Jesus was ever faithful\
and always true,\
8:12\
His earnest desire is that we exhibit\
these qualities in our lives.\
8:16\
When our faith falters, we\
can cry out to Jesus,\
8:19\
“Lord, save me,” just like Peter as he\
began to sink in Galilee’s stormy sea.\
8:25\
On that day, Jesus reached down to\
rescue the drowning disciple.\
8:29\
He has done the same for me, and\
He will do the same for you.\
8:33\
Don’t ever give up on Jesus; He\
will never give up on you.\
8:39\
When we are faithful and true, we follow\
Jesus’s call to “Abide in me,”\
8:43\
which can also mean “stay with me.”\
8:46\
When we are confronted with questions,\
when we are mocked for our faith,\
8:49\
when the fingers of scorn are pointed\
at us by those in the world's great\
8:53\
and spacious buildings, we remain\
faithful and we stay true.\
8:57\
In these moments, we remember Jesus’s\
plea: “Look unto me in every thought;\
9:04\
doubt not, fear not.” As we do so,\
He gives us needed faith,\
9:10\
hope, and strength to stay\
with Him forever.\
9:15\
Dear brothers and sisters,\
9:17\
Jesus wants for us to know\
Him because His is\
9:19\
the only name under heaven\
whereby we can be saved.\
9:24\
Jesus is the way, the\
truth, and the life—\
9:29\
no man can return to the Father except\
by Him. Jesus is the only way!\
9:35\
For that reason, Jesus beckons,\
“come unto me,” “follow me,”\
9:40\
“walk with me,” and “learn of me.”\
With all my heart,\
9:46\
I bear witness of Jesus Christ, that\
He lives, that He loves you,\
9:53\
and that He knows you by name.\
9:56\
He is the Son of God, the Only\
Begotten of the Father.\
10:00\
He is our Rock, our Fortress, our\
Shield, our Refuge, and our Deliverer.\
10:09\
He is the Light which Shineth\
in Darkness.\
10:11\
He is our Savior and Redeemer. He is\
the Resurrection and the Life.\
10:19\
My earnest desire is that you will come\
to know Jesus Christ by His many names,\
10:25\
and that you will become like Him\
10:27\
as you exemplify His divine\
attributes in your life.\
10:31\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
