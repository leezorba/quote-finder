Parables are a defining feature of\
0:04\
the Lord Jesus Christ's masterful\
approach to teaching.\
0:08\
Simply described, the Savior's parables\
are stories used to compare spiritual\
0:14\
truths with material things\
and mortal experiences.\
0:18\
For example, the New Testament gospels\
are replete with teachings\
0:24\
likening the kingdom of heaven\
to a grain of mustard\
0:27\
seed, to a pearl of great price,\
0:31\
to a householder and laborers in his\
vineyard, to ten virgins, and many,\
0:36\
many others. During part of the\
Lord’s Galilean ministry,\
0:40\
the scriptures indicate that “without\
a parable spake he not unto them.”\
0:47\
The intended meaning or message of\
0:49\
a parable typically is not\
expressed explicitly.\
0:54\
Rather, the story only conveys\
divine truth to\
0:58\
a receiver in proportion to\
his or her faith in God,\
1:03\
personal spiritual preparation,\
and willingness to learn.\
1:08\
Thus, an individual must exercise\
moral agency and actively “ask,\
1:14\
seek, and knock” to discover the\
truths embedded in a parable.\
1:21\
I earnestly pray that the Holy Ghost\
will enlighten each of us\
1:25\
as we now consider the importance of the\
parable of the royal marriage feast.\
1:32\
“And Jesus ... spake unto them again\
by parables, and said,\
1:37\
“The kingdom of heaven is like\
unto a certain king,\
1:41\
which made a marriage for his son.\
1:43\
“And sent forth his servants to call\
them that were bidden to the wedding:\
1:48\
and they would not come. “Again,\
1:51\
he sent forth other servants, saying,\
Tell them which are bidden,  Behold,\
1:55\
I have prepared my dinner:\
1:58\
my oxen and my fatlings are killed,\
and all things are ready:\
2:02\
come unto the marriage. “But they made\
light of it and went their ways,\
2:09\
one to his farm, another\
to his merchandise.”\
2:15\
In ancient times, one of the most joyous\
occasions in Jewish life was\
2:20\
a wedding celebration—an event that\
would span a week or even two.\
2:25\
Such an event required\
extensive planning,\
2:29\
and guests were informed far in advance,\
2:32\
with a reminder sent on the opening\
day of the festivities.\
2:38\
An invitation from a king to his\
subjects to a wedding such as this\
2:43\
was essentially considered a command.\
2:47\
Yet many of the bidden guests in\
this parable did not come.\
2:53\
“The refusal to attend\
the king’s feast was\
2:57\
a deliberate act of rebellion\
against royal authority and\
3:02\
a personal indignity against both the\
reigning sovereign and his son.\
3:08\
The turning away by one man to his farm\
3:11\
and by another to his [business\
interests]” reflect their misguided\
3:16\
priorities and total disregard of the\
king’s will. The parable continues:\
3:23\
“Then saith he to his servants,\
3:26\
The wedding is ready, but they which\
were bidden were not worthy.\
3:31\
“Go ye therefore into the highways,\
and as many as ye shall find,\
3:37\
bid to the marriage. “So those servants\
went out into the highways,\
3:42\
and gathered together all as many\
as they found, both bad and good:\
3:48\
and the wedding was furnished\
with guests.”\
3:53\
The custom in those days was for\
the host of a wedding feast—\
3:57\
iIn this parable, the king—to provide\
garments for the wedding guests.\
4:03\
Such wedding garments were simple,\
4:05\
nondescript robes that\
all attendees wore.\
4:10\
In this way, rank and\
station were eliminated,\
4:14\
and everyone at the feast\
could mingle as equals.\
4:19\
People invited from the highways to\
attend the wedding would not have had\
4:24\
the time or means to procure appropriate\
attire in preparation for the event.\
4:31\
Consequently, the king likely\
gave guests the garments\
4:36\
from his own wardrobe.\
4:39\
Everyone was given the opportunity\
to clothe themselves in\
4:43\
the garments of royalty. As the\
king entered the wedding hall,\
4:48\
he surveyed the audience and immediately\
noticed that one\
4:53\
conspicuous guest was not wearing\
a wedding garment.\
4:57\
The man was brought forward,\
and the king asked: “Friend,\
5:02\
how camest thou in hither not\
having a wedding garment?\
5:07\
And he was speechless.” In essence,\
the king asked,\
5:13\
“Why are you not wearing a wedding\
garment, even though one was provided\
5:17\
for you?” The man obviously was\
not dressed properly for\
5:21\
the special occasion, and the phrase\
“And he was speechless” indicates that\
5:28\
the man was without excuse.\
5:32\
Elder James E. Talmage provides this\
instructive commentary about\
5:36\
the significance of the\
man’s actions:\
5:41\
“That the unrobed guest\
was guilty of neglect,\
5:45\
intentional disrespect, or some more\
grievous offense is plain from\
5:51\
the context. The king at first\
was graciously considerate,\
5:57\
inquiring only as to how the man had\
entered without a wedding garment.\
6:03\
Had the man been able to explain\
his exceptional appearance,\
6:07\
or had he any reasonable excuse to\
offer, he surely would have spoken;\
6:14\
but we are told he remained speechless.”\
Elder Talmage continues,\
6:20\
“The king’s summons had been freely\
extended to all whom his servants had\
6:25\
found; but each of them had to enter\
the royal palace by the door;\
6:31\
and before reaching the banquet room, in\
which the king would appear in person,\
6:37\
each would be properly attired;\
6:40\
but the deficient one, by some means\
had entered by another way;\
6:45\
and not having passed the attendant\
sentinels at the portal,\
6:49\
he was an intruder.”\
6:54\
A Christian author, John O. Reid, noted\
that the man’s refusal to wear\
6:59\
the wedding garment exemplified blatant\
disrespect for both the king\
7:04\
and his son. He did not simply\
lack a wedding garment;\
7:09\
rather, he chose not to wear one.\
7:13\
He rebelliously refused to dress\
appropriately for the occasion.\
7:19\
The king’s reaction was\
swift and decisive:\
7:23\
“Bind him hand and foot, ... take him\
away, and cast him into outer darkness;\
7:29\
there [will] be weeping and\
gnashing of teeth.”\
7:33\
Now, brothers and sisters,\
7:34\
the king's judgment of the man is not\
based primarily upon the lack of\
7:39\
a wedding garment but that he was, in\
fact, determined not to wear one.\
7:46\
The man desired the honor of attending\
the wedding feast\
7:49\
but did not want to follow\
the custom of the king.\
7:53\
He wanted to do things his own way.\
7:55\
His lack of proper dress revealed his\
inner rebellion against the king\
8:00\
and his instructions. This parable then\
concludes with this penetrating\
8:07\
scripture, “For many are called,\
but few are chosen.”\
8:14\
Interestingly, the Prophet\
Joseph Smith made\
8:17\
the following adjustment to this verse\
from Matthew in his inspired\
8:21\
translation of the Bible: “For many\
are called, but few are chosen;\
8:28\
wherefore all do not have\
on the wedding garment.”\
8:35\
The invitation to the wedding feast\
and the choice to partake in\
8:40\
the feast are related but different.\
The invitation is to all men and women.\
8:49\
An individual may even accept the\
invitation and sit down at\
8:53\
the feast yet not be chosen to partake\
because he or she does not have\
9:00\
the appropriate wedding garment\
of converting faith in\
9:04\
the Lord Jesus Christ and\
in His divine grace.\
9:09\
Thus we have both God’s call and our\
individual response to that call,\
9:16\
and many may be called but few chosen.\
9:21\
To be or to become chosen is not an\
exclusive status conferred upon us.\
9:28\
Rather, you and I ultimately can\
choose to be chosen through\
9:33\
the righteous exercise\
of our moral agency.\
9:38\
Please note the use of the word “chosen”\
in the following familiar verses from\
9:42\
the Doctrine and Covenants:\
9:45\
“Behold, there are many called,\
but few are chosen.\
9:49\
And why are they not chosen?\
9:52\
“Because their hearts are set so much\
upon the things of this world,\
9:56\
and aspire to the honors of men.”\
10:01\
I believe the implication of these\
verses is quite straightforward.\
10:05\
God does not have a list of favorites\
to which we must hope our names will\
10:10\
someday be added. He does not limit\
“the chosen” to a restricted few.\
10:15\
Instead, our hearts, our desires,\
10:19\
our honoring of sacred gospel\
covenants and ordinances,\
10:22\
our obedience to the commandments,\
and, most importantly,\
10:26\
the Savior's redeeming grace and mercy\
determine whether we are counted\
10:32\
as one of God’s chosen. “For we\
labor diligently to write,\
10:38\
to persuade our children, and also our\
brethren, to believe in Christ,\
10:43\
and to be reconciled to God;\
10:46\
for we know that it is by grace that\
we are saved, after all we can do.”\
10:53\
In the busyness of our daily lives\
and in the commotion of\
10:56\
the contemporary world in which we live,\
11:00\
we may be distracted from the\
eternal things that matter\
11:03\
the most by making pleasure, prosperity,\
popularity, and prominence\
11:10\
our primary priorities. Our short-term\
preoccupation with “the things of\
11:15\
the world” and the “honors of men” may\
lead us to forfeit our spiritual\
11:22\
birthright for far less than\
a mess of pottage.\
11:27\
I repeat the admonition of the Lord\
to His people delivered to\
11:31\
the Old Testament prophet Haggai:\
11:34\
“Now therefore thus saith the Lord\
of hosts; Consider your ways.”\
11:41\
Each of us should evaluate our temporal\
and spiritual priorities sincerely\
11:47\
and prayerfully to identify the things\
in our lives that may impede\
11:52\
the bounteous blessings that\
Heavenly Father and\
11:56\
the Savior are willing\
to bestow upon us.\
11:59\
And surely the Holy Ghost will help us\
to see ourselves as we really are.\
12:07\
As we appropriately seek for the\
spiritual gift of eyes to see\
12:11\
and ears to hear, I promise that we\
will be blessed with the capacity\
12:16\
and judgment to strengthen our\
individual covenant connection with\
12:21\
the living Lord. We also will receive\
the power of godliness in our lives—\
12:27\
and ultimately be both called to and\
chosen for the Lord’s feast.\
12:36\
“Awake, awake;\
put on thy strength, O Zion.”\
12:41\
“For Zion must increase in\
beauty, and in holiness;\
12:46\
her borders must be enlarged; her stakes\
must be strengthened; yea,\
12:50\
verily I say unto you, Zion must arise\
and put on her beautiful garments.”\
13:00\
I joyfully declare my witness\
of the divinity\
13:04\
and living reality of God, our Eternal\
Father, and of His Beloved Son,\
13:09\
Jesus Christ. I testify that Jesus\
Christ is our Savior and Redeemer,\
13:15\
and He lives. And I also witnessed that\
the Father and the Son appeared to\
13:21\
the boy Joseph Smith, thus initiating\
the Restoration of the Savior’s gospel\
13:26\
in the latter-days. May each of us seek\
for and be blessed with eyes to see\
13:36\
and ears to hear, I pray in the sacred\
name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
