My dear brothers and sisters,\
in the Book of Mormon,\
0:04\
the phrase “this day” is used repeatedly\
to call attention to counsel, promises,\
0:11\
and teachings. King Benjamin, in\
his final address, admonished\
0:16\
the people, “hear my words which\
I shall speak unto you this day; ...\
0:23\
open your ears that you may hear, and\
your hearts that ye may understand,\
0:28\
and your minds that the mysteries of\
God may be unfolded to your view.”\
0:35\
General Conference is a similar setting.\
0:37\
We come to hear counsel for this day\
that we may be true at all times to\
0:44\
the Lord and His Gospel. Pressing\
upon me this day is\
0:49\
the importance of renewing our\
commitment to the Book of Mormon,\
0:54\
which Joseph Smith called “the most\
correct of any book on earth.”\
1:00\
I hold in my hand a copy\
of the Book of Mormon.\
1:03\
This is my 1970 vintage edition,\
and it is precious to me.\
1:11\
By its appearance it is tired and worn,\
1:14\
but no other book is as important to my\
life and my testimony as this one.\
1:21\
Reading it I gained a witness by\
the Spirit that Jesus Christ is\
1:25\
the Son of God, that He is my Savior,\
1:29\
that these scriptures are the word of\
God, and that the gospel is restored.\
1:34\
Those truths rest deep within me.\
1:38\
As the prophet Nephi said, “My soul\
delighteth in the things of the Lord.”\
1:44\
Here is the backstory.\
As a young missionary,\
1:48\
I took the counsel of Elder\
Marion D. Hanks,\
1:51\
who visited us in the Eastern\
States Mission.\
1:55\
He was the former president\
of the British Mission,\
1:58\
and two of his missionaries\
are on the stand this day:\
2:02\
My dear brethren, Elder Jeffrey R.\
Holland and Elder Quentin L. Cook.\
2:07\
Just as with his missionaries\
in England,\
2:10\
he challenged us to read\
an unmarked copy of\
2:14\
the Book of Mormon at least two times.\
I took up the task.\
2:20\
The first reading I was to mark or\
underline everything that pointed to\
2:25\
or testified of Jesus Christ.\
2:28\
I used a red pencil and I underlined\
many passages.\
2:33\
The second time, Elder Hanks said\
to highlight principles\
2:37\
and doctrine of the gospel,\
2:39\
and this time I used blue\
to mark the scriptures.\
2:43\
I read the Book of Mormon\
twice as suggested,\
2:47\
and then two more times using yellow\
2:50\
and black to mark passages\
that stood out to me.\
2:55\
As you can see, I made many notations.\
3:00\
There was much more to my reading than\
just marking scriptures. With each\
3:05\
reading of the Book of\
Mormon, front to back,\
3:07\
I was filled with a profound\
love for the Lord.\
3:12\
I felt a deeply rooted witness\
of the truth of His teachings\
3:16\
and how they apply to this day.\
3:20\
This book fits its title “Another\
Testament of Jesus Christ.”\
3:26\
With that study and the spiritual\
witness that was received,\
3:31\
I became a Book of Mormon missionary\
and a disciple of Jesus Christ.\
3:38\
This day, one of the greatest\
missionaries of\
3:41\
the Book of Mormon is President\
Russell M. Nelson.\
3:45\
When he was a newly called Apostle, he\
was giving a lecture in Accra, Ghana.\
3:51\
In attendance were dignitaries,\
3:53\
including an African Tribal King with\
whom he spoke through an interpreter.\
4:00\
The king was a serious student of\
the Bible and loved the Lord.\
4:05\
Following his remarks, he was\
approached by that King,\
4:09\
who asked in perfect English,\
“Just who are you?”\
4:14\
President Nelson explained he was “an\
ordained Apostle of Jesus Christ.”\
4:20\
The King’s next question was “What can\
you teach me about Jesus Christ?”\
4:28\
President Nelson reached for the Book of\
Mormon and opened it to 3 Nephi\
4:32\
chapter 11. Together, President\
Nelson and the King read\
4:37\
the Savior’s sermon to the Nephites:\
4:40\
“Behold, I am Jesus Christ,\
4:42\
whom the prophets testified\
shall come into the world. ...\
4:46\
I am the light and ... the\
life of the world.”\
4:50\
President Nelson presented the King\
with that copy of the Book of Mormon,\
4:55\
and the King responded, “You could have\
given me diamonds or rubies,\
5:01\
but nothing is more precious to me than\
this additional knowledge about\
5:07\
the Lord Jesus Christ.” That is not\
5:11\
an isolated example of how our beloved\
prophet shares the Book of Mormon.\
5:16\
He has given copies of the Book of\
Mormon to hundreds of people, always\
5:21\
bearing his witness of Jesus Christ.\
5:24\
When President Nelson meets with guests,\
presidents, kings, heads of state,\
5:30\
leaders of business and organizations\
and of diverse faiths,\
5:34\
whether at Church headquarters\
or in their own locations,\
5:39\
he reverently presents this book\
of revealed scripture.\
5:44\
He could give them so many things\
wrapped in ribbons that might sit on\
5:49\
a table or desk or in cabinets\
as a reminder of his visit.\
5:53\
Instead, he gives what is most precious\
to him, far beyond rubies and diamonds,\
6:01\
as the Tribal King described.\
6:04\
“The truths of the Book of Mormon,”\
President Nelson said,\
6:08\
“have the power to heal, comfort,\
restore, succor,\
6:12\
strengthen, console, and\
cheer our souls.”\
6:17\
I have watched as these copies of\
6:19\
the Book of Mormon have\
been clutched in\
6:21\
the hands of those who have received\
them from our Prophet of God.\
6:26\
There could be no greater gift.\
6:30\
Just recently, he met with the First\
Lady of the Gambia in his office\
6:35\
and humbly handed her a Book of Mormon.\
He did not stop there.\
6:40\
He opened its pages to read with her, to\
teach and testify of Jesus Christ,\
6:46\
His Atonement, and His love for\
all His children everywhere.\
6:53\
Our living prophet is doing his part to\
flood the earth with the Book of Mormon.\
6:58\
But he cannot open the floodgates alone.\
We must follow his lead.\
7:05\
Inspired by his example, I have\
been trying to humbly\
7:09\
and more fervently share\
the Book of Mormon.\
7:13\
Recently, I was on assignment\
in Mozambique.\
7:17\
The citizens of this beautiful country\
are struggling with poverty,\
7:22\
poor health, unemployment, storms,\
and political unrest.\
7:27\
I had the honor of meeting with the\
country's president, Felipe Nyusi.\
7:33\
At his request, I prayed\
for him and his nation.\
7:37\
I told him we were building a temple\
of Jesus Christ in his country.\
7:43\
At the end of our visit, I presented\
to him a copy of\
7:46\
the Book of Mormon in Portuguese,\
his native language,\
7:50\
and he gratefully accepted the book.\
7:54\
I testified of the hope and promise\
for his people found in\
7:58\
the Lord's words, on its pages.\
8:02\
On another occasion, my wife, Melanie,\
and I met with King and Queen Letsie III\
8:06\
of Lesotho at their home.\
8:10\
For us, the highlight of our\
visit was presenting them with\
8:15\
a copy of the Book of Mormon and\
then sharing my testimony.\
8:20\
When I look back on that experience\
8:22\
and others, a verse of latter-day\
scripture comes to mind:\
8:27\
“The fullness of my gospel might\
be proclaimed by the weak and\
8:31\
the simple unto the ends of the world,\
and before kings and rulers.”\
8:39\
I have shared the Book of Mormon with\
India’s Ambassador Pandey to\
8:43\
the United Nations in Geneva, and with\
His Holiness Patriarch Bartholomew of\
8:49\
the Eastern Orthodox Church,\
and many others.\
8:53\
I have felt the Spirit of\
the Lord with us as\
8:56\
I have personally handed them this\
keystone of our religion\
9:01\
and borne my witness of Jesus Christ,\
the cornerstone of our faith.\
9:09\
Now, brothers and sisters,\
9:11\
you do not have to go to Mozambique\
or India or meet with kings\
9:15\
and rulers to give someone this book\
of sacred teaching and promises.\
9:21\
I invite you this day to give a\
Book of Mormon to your friends\
9:26\
and family, associates at work,\
9:28\
your soccer coach, or the produce\
man at your market.\
9:32\
They need the words of the\
Lord found in this book.\
9:36\
They need answers to the questions\
of everyday life\
9:40\
and of eternal life to come.\
9:42\
They need to know of the covenant\
path laid out before them and\
9:47\
the Lord's abiding love for them. It's\
all here in the Book of Mormon.\
9:56\
When you hand them a Book of Mormon,\
9:58\
you are opening their minds and\
hearts to the word of God.\
10:03\
You do not need to carry printed\
copies of the book with you.\
10:07\
You can easily share it from\
your mobile phone\
10:10\
from the scriptures section\
of the Gospel Library App.\
10:16\
Think of all those who could be blessed\
by the gospel in their lives,\
10:20\
and then send to them a copy of the\
Book of Mormon from your phone.\
10:26\
Remember to include your testimony and\
how this book has blessed your life.\
10:32\
My dear friends, as an\
Apostle of the Lord,\
10:37\
I invite you to follow\
our beloved prophet,\
10:40\
President Nelson, in flooding the\
earth with the Book of Mormon.\
10:47\
The need is so great;\
we need to act now.\
10:54\
I promise you will be participating\
in “the greatest work on earth,”\
10:59\
the gathering of Israel, as you are\
inspired to reach out to those who have\
11:04\
been “kept from the truth because\
they know not where to find it.”\
11:09\
They need your testimony and witness of\
how this book has changed your life\
11:15\
and drawn you closer to God, His peace,\
and His “tidings of great joy.”\
11:23\
I testify that by divine design,\
11:27\
the Book of Mormon was prepared in\
ancient America to come forth to\
11:32\
declare God’s word, to bring souls to\
11:36\
the Lord Jesus Christ and His restored\
gospel this day.\
11:44\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
