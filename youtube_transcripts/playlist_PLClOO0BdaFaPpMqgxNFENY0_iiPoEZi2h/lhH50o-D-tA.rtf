Brothers, sisters, friends:\
0:05\
In 2013, my wife, Laurel, and I were\
called to serve as mission leaders in\
0:09\
the Czech/Slovak Mission. Our four\
children served with us.\
0:14\
We were blessed as a family with\
brilliant missionaries and by\
0:18\
the remarkable Czech and Slovak Saints.\
We love them.\
0:22\
As our family entered the mission field,\
0:24\
something Elder Joseph B. Worthlin\
taught went with us. In\
0:28\
a talk titled “The Great Commandment,”\
0:32\
Elder Wirthlin asked,\
“Do you love the Lord?”\
0:35\
His counsel to those of us who would\
answer yes was simple and profound:\
0:40\
“Spend time with Him. Meditate on His\
words. Take His yoke upon you.\
0:45\
Seek to understand and obey.”\
0:49\
Elder Wirthlin then promised\
transformative blessings to those\
0:52\
willing to give time and\
place to Jesus Christ.\
0:56\
We took Elder Wirthlin’s counsel\
and promise to heart.\
1:00\
Together with our missionaries,\
1:01\
we spent extended time with Jesus,\
studying Matthew, Mark,\
1:05\
Luke, and John from the New Testament\
and 3 Nephi from the Book of Mormon.\
1:10\
At the end of every missionary meeting,\
1:12\
we found ourselves back in what we\
referred to as the “Five Gospels,”\
1:17\
reading, discussing, considering,\
and learning about Jesus.\
1:22\
For me, for Laurel, and\
for our missionaries,\
1:26\
spending time with Jesus in the\
scriptures changed everything.\
1:31\
We gained a deeper appreciation\
for who He was\
1:34\
and what was important to Him.\
1:36\
Together we considered how\
He taught, what He taught,\
1:40\
the ways He showed love, what He did\
to bless and serve, His miracles,\
1:45\
how He responded to betrayal,\
1:47\
what He did with difficult human\
emotions, His titles and names,\
1:51\
how He listened, how He resolved\
conflict, the world He lived in,\
1:55\
His parables, how He encouraged\
unity and kindness,\
1:59\
His capacity to forgive and to heal,\
2:02\
His sermons, His prayers, His atoning\
sacrifice, His Resurrection, His gospel.\
2:09\
We often felt like the “[short] of\
stature” Zacchaeus running to climb\
2:14\
a sycamore tree as Jesus\
passed through Jericho,\
2:18\
because, as Luke described it, we\
“sought to see Jesus who He was.”\
2:24\
It was not Jesus as we wanted\
or wished Him to be,\
2:28\
but rather Jesus as He\
really was and is.\
2:32\
Just as Elder Worthlin had promised,\
2:34\
we learned in a very real way that\
“the gospel of Jesus Christ is\
2:39\
a gospel of transformation.\
2:41\
It takes us as men and women of the\
earth and refines us into men\
2:46\
and women for the eternities.”\
Those were special days.\
2:50\
We came to believe that “with God\
nothing shall be impossible.”\
2:54\
Sacred afternoons in Prague,\
Bratislava, or Brno,\
2:58\
experiencing the power and reality of\
Jesus, continue to resonate in all of\
3:05\
our lives. We often studied\
Mark 2:1–12.\
3:10\
The story there is compelling.\
3:13\
I want to read part of it directly\
from Mark and then share it as\
3:16\
I have come to understand it\
after comprehensive study\
3:19\
and discussion with our missionaries\
and others.\
3:22\
“And again [Jesus] entered into\
Capernaum after some days;\
3:26\
and it was noised that\
he was in the house.\
3:29\
And straightway many were\
gathered together,\
3:32\
insomuch that there was no\
room to receive them,\
3:35\
no, not so much as about the door:\
3:37\
and he preached the word unto them.\
3:40\
And they come unto him, bringing\
one sick of the palsy,\
3:43\
which was borne of four. And when they\
could not come nigh unto him for\
3:46\
the press, they uncovered\
the roof where he was:\
3:50\
and when they had broken it up,\
3:52\
they let down the bed wherein\
the sick of the palsy lay.\
3:56\
When Jesus saw their faith, he said\
unto the sick of the palsy, Son,\
4:00\
thy sins be forgiven thee.”\
4:03\
Then, after an exchange with\
some in the crowd,\
4:06\
Jesus looks at the man sick of palsy\
and heals him physically, saying,\
4:12\
“I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy\
bed, and go thy way into thine house.\
4:18\
And immediately he arose, took up the\
bed, and went forth before them\
4:22\
all; insomuch that they were all\
amazed, and glorified God, saying,\
4:28\
We never saw it on this fashion.”\
4:31\
Now the story as I have\
come to understand it:\
4:34\
Early in His ministry, Jesus\
returned to Capernaum,\
4:37\
a small fishing village located on the\
north shore of the Sea of Galilee.\
4:41\
He had recently performed a series\
of miracles by healing the sick\
4:45\
and casting out evil spirits.\
4:47\
Anxious to hear and experience\
the man called Jesus,\
4:51\
the villagers gathered at the home where\
He was rumored to be staying.\
4:54\
As they did, Jesus began to teach.\
4:58\
Homes at that time in Capernaum\
were flat-roofed,\
5:01\
single-story dwellings\
grouped together.\
5:03\
The roof and walls were a mixture of\
stone, timber, clay, and thatch,\
5:07\
accessed by a set of simple steps\
on the side of the home.\
5:11\
The crowd grew quickly at the house,\
5:13\
filled the room where Jesus was\
teaching, and spread out into\
5:16\
the street. The story focuses on a man\
sick of the palsy and his four friends.\
5:22\
Palsy is a form of paralysis, often\
accompanied by weakness and tremors.\
5:27\
I imagine one of the four saying to the\
others, “Jesus is in our village.\
5:31\
We all know about the miracles He has\
performed and those He has healed.\
5:36\
If we can just get our friend to Jesus,\
perhaps he too can be made whole.”\
5:42\
So they each take a corner of\
their friend's mat or bed\
5:46\
and begin carrying him through\
the crooked, narrow,\
5:49\
unpaved streets of Capernaum.\
5:52\
Muscles aching, they turn the last\
corner, only to find that the crowd,\
5:56\
or, as the scripture calls it,\
5:58\
the “press,” of people gathered\
to listen is\
6:01\
so great that getting to\
Jesus is impossible.\
6:05\
With love and faith, the\
four do not give up.\
6:08\
Rather, they scramble up the\
steps onto the flat roof,\
6:11\
carefully lift their friend\
and his bed up with them,\
6:14\
break open the roof over the room\
where Jesus is teaching,\
6:18\
and let their friend down.\
6:20\
Consider, brothers and sisters, that in\
the middle of what must have been\
6:24\
a serious teaching moment, Jesus\
hears a scratching noise,\
6:29\
looks up, and sees a growing hole\
in the ceiling as dust\
6:33\
and thatch fall into the room.\
6:35\
A paralyzed man on a bed is\
then lowered to the floor.\
6:38\
Remarkably, Jesus discerns that\
this is not an interruption,\
6:44\
but rather something that matters.\
6:46\
He looks at the man on the bed,\
6:48\
publicly forgives his sins,\
and physically heals him.\
6:52\
With that telling of Mark 2 in mind,\
6:54\
several important truths become clear\
about Jesus as the Christ.\
6:59\
First, when we try to help someone\
we love come unto Christ,\
7:04\
we can do so with confidence that\
He has the capacity to lift\
7:08\
the burden of sin and to forgive.\
7:10\
Second, when we bring physical,\
emotional, or other illnesses to Christ,\
7:16\
we can do so knowing He has the\
power to heal and comfort.\
7:20\
Third, when we make effort like the\
four to bring others to Christ,\
7:25\
we can do so with certainty that\
He sees our true intentions\
7:28\
and will appropriately honor them.\
7:30\
Remember, Jesus's teaching was disrupted\
by the appearance of\
7:35\
a hole in the roof. Rather than chastise\
or dismiss the four who made\
7:39\
the hole for interrupting,\
7:40\
the scripture tells us that\
“Jesus saw their faith.”\
7:46\
Those that witnessed the miracle\
7:48\
then “marvelled, and glorified God,\
which had given such power [to] men.”\
7:54\
Brothers and sisters, let me close\
with two additional observations.\
8:00\
Whether as missionaries, ministers,\
Relief Society presidents, bishops,\
8:03\
teachers, parents, siblings, or friends,\
8:07\
we are all engaged as Latter-day\
Saint disciples in\
8:11\
the work of bringing others to Christ.\
8:14\
Thus, the qualities exhibited by the\
four friends are worth considering\
8:18\
and emulating. They are bold, adaptive,\
resilient, creative, versatile, hopeful,\
8:25\
determined, faithful, optimistic,\
humble, and enduring. Additionally,\
8:31\
the four emphasized the spiritual\
importance of community\
8:35\
and fellowship. In order to bring\
their friend to Christ,\
8:39\
each of the four must\
carry their corner.\
8:41\
If one lets go, things\
get more difficult.\
8:44\
If two give up, the task effectively\
becomes impossible.\
8:50\
Each of us has a role to play\
in the kingdom of God.\
8:54\
As we fill that role and do our part,\
we carry our corner.\
8:58\
Whether in Argentina or Vietnam,\
Accra or Brisbane,\
9:01\
a branch or a ward, a family or\
a missionary companionship—\
9:05\
we each have a corner to carry.\
As we do, and if we will,\
9:11\
the Lord blesses us all.\
As He saw their faith,\
9:16\
so will He see ours and bless us as\
a people. At different times\
9:22\
I have carried the corner of a bed,\
and at other times I have been\
9:26\
the one carried. Part of the power of\
this remarkable story of Jesus is that\
9:32\
it reminds us just how much we\
need each other as brothers\
9:36\
and sisters to come unto Christ\
and be transformed.\
9:41\
These are a few of the things\
9:43\
I have learned from spending time\
with Jesus in Mark 2.\
9:47\
May God grant that we may be able to\
carry our corner, that we may not shirk,\
9:52\
that we may not fear, but that\
we may be strong in our faith\
9:55\
and determined in our work to accomplish\
the purposes of the Lord.\
9:59\
I witness that Jesus lives,\
that He knows us,\
10:04\
and that He has the power\
to heal, to transform,\
10:09\
and to forgive. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
10:14\
Amen.\
