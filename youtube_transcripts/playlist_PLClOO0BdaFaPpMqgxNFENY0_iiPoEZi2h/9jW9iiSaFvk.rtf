I would like to speak about what I\
call the doctrine of belonging in\
0:07\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
0:11\
This doctrine has three parts: the\
role of belonging in gathering\
0:16\
the Lord’s covenant people,\
the importance\
0:20\
of service and sacrifice\
0:22\
in belonging, and the centrality\
of Jesus Christ to belonging.\
0:30\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints, in its early beginnings,\
0:35\
was made up largely of white North\
American and Northern European Saints\
0:41\
with a relative handful\
of Native Americans,\
0:44\
African Americans,\
and Pacific Islanders.\
0:49\
Now, eight years away from the 200th\
anniversary of its founding,\
0:54\
the Church has greatly\
increased in numbers\
0:57\
and diversity in North America and\
even more so in the rest of\
1:01\
the world. As the long-prophesied\
latter-day gathering of\
1:06\
the Lord’s covenant people\
gains momentum,\
1:10\
the Church will truly be comprised\
of members from every nation,\
1:14\
kindred, tongue, and people.\
1:17\
This is not a calculated\
or forced diversity,\
1:20\
but a naturally occurring phenomenon\
that we would expect,\
1:24\
recognizing that the gospel net gathers\
from every nation and every people.\
1:30\
How blessed we are to see\
1:31\
the day that Zion is being established\
simultaneously on every continent\
1:37\
and in our own neighborhoods. As\
the Prophet Joseph Smith said,\
1:43\
the people of God in every age have\
looked forward with joyful anticipation\
1:47\
to this day, and “we are the favored\
people that God has made choice of to\
1:54\
bring about the Latter-day glory.”\
1:57\
Having been given this privilege,\
we cannot permit any racism,\
2:01\
tribal prejudice, or other\
divisions to exist in\
2:05\
the latter-day Church of Christ.\
The Lord commands us, “Be one;\
2:10\
and if ye are not one, ye are not mine.”\
2:13\
We should be diligent in rooting\
prejudice and discrimination out of\
2:17\
the Church, out of our homes, and\
most of all, out of our hearts.\
2:23\
As our Church population grows\
ever more diverse,\
2:26\
our welcome must grow ever more\
spontaneous and warm.\
2:30\
We need one another. In his first\
epistle to the Corinthians,\
2:36\
Paul declares that all who are baptized\
into the church are one in\
2:41\
the body of Christ: “For as\
the body is one, and hath\
2:45\
many members, and all the members of\
that one body, being many, are one body:\
2:50\
so also is Christ. For by one Spirit\
2:55\
are we all baptized into one body,\
whether we be Jews or Gentiles,\
3:00\
whether we be bond or free; and have all\
been made to drink into one Spirit.\
3:06\
. . . That there should be no\
schism in the body;\
3:09\
but that the members should have\
the same care one for another.\
3:13\
And whether one member suffer,\
3:15\
all the members suffer with it;\
or one member be honoured,\
3:19\
all the members rejoice with it.”\
3:23\
A sense of belonging is important\
to our physical,\
3:26\
mental, and spiritual well-being,\
3:29\
yet it is quite possible that at times\
each of us might feel that we don’t\
3:34\
fit in. In discouraging moments,\
3:37\
we may feel that we will never measure\
up to the Lord's high standards or\
3:42\
the expectations of others.\
3:44\
We may unwittingly impose\
expectations on others—\
3:48\
or even ourselves—that are not\
the Lord’s expectations.\
3:52\
We may communicate in subtle ways that\
the worth of a soul is based\
3:56\
on certain achievements or callings,\
4:00\
but these are not the measure of our\
standing in the Lord’s eyes.\
4:03\
“The Lord looketh on the heart.”\
4:06\
He cares about our desires and longings\
and what we are becoming.\
4:11\
Sister Jody King wrote of her own\
experience of past years:\
4:16\
“I never felt like I didn’t belong at\
church until my husband, Cameron,\
4:21\
and I began struggling with infertility.\
4:25\
The children and families who had\
typically brought me joy to see\
4:29\
at church now started causing\
me grief and pain.\
4:33\
I felt barren without a child in my\
arms or a diaper bag in hand. . . .\
4:38\
The hardest Sunday was our\
first one in a new ward.\
4:42\
Because we didn’t have kids,\
4:44\
we were asked if we were newlyweds\
4:45\
and when we planned on\
starting a family.\
4:49\
I had gotten pretty good at answering\
these questions without letting them\
4:52\
affect me—I knew they weren’t\
meant to be hurtful.\
4:56\
However, on this Sunday, answering those\
questions was especially hard.\
5:01\
We had just found out, after\
being hopeful, that we were—\
5:05\
yet again—not pregnant. I walked\
into sacrament meeting\
5:11\
feeling downtrodden, and answering those\
typical ‘get to know you’ questions\
5:15\
was hard for me. But it was Sunday\
School that truly broke my heart.\
5:21\
The lesson—intended to be about\
5:23\
the divine role of mothers—quickly\
shifted gears and became\
5:26\
a vent[ing] session. My heart sank\
5:30\
and tears silently flowed down my cheeks\
as I heard women complain about\
5:34\
a blessing I would give anything for.\
5:38\
I bolted out of church. At first,\
I didn’t want to go back.\
5:41\
I didn't want to experience that\
feeling of isolation again.\
5:46\
But that night, after talking\
with my husband,\
5:48\
we knew we would keep attending church\
5:51\
not only because the Lord\
has asked us to\
5:54\
but also because we both knew that\
5:57\
the joy that comes from renewing\
covenants and feeling\
6:00\
the Spirit at church surpasses\
the sadness I felt that day. . . .\
6:06\
In the Church, there are widowed,\
divorced, and single members;\
6:10\
those with family members who have\
fallen away from the gospel;\
6:13\
people with chronic illnesses\
or financial struggles;\
6:17\
members who experience\
same-sex attraction;\
6:19\
members working to overcome\
addictions or doubts;\
6:23\
recent converts; new move-ins, empty\
nesters; and the list goes on and on.\
6:29\
. . . The Savior invites us to come\
unto Him—no matter our circumstances.\
6:34\
We come to church to renew our\
covenants, to increase our faith,\
6:38\
to find peace, and to do as He\
did perfectly in His life—\
6:43\
minister to others who feel like\
they don’t belong.”\
6:50\
Paul explained that the Church and\
its officers are given by God “for\
6:55\
the perfecting of the saints, for\
the work of the ministry,\
6:59\
for the edifying of the body of Christ:\
7:02\
Till we all come in the unity of the\
faith and the knowledge of\
7:06\
the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto\
the measure of the stature of\
7:11\
the fulness of Christ.” It\
is a sad irony, then,\
7:16\
when someone, feeling he\
or she doesn’t meet\
7:18\
the ideal in all aspects of life,\
concludes that they don’t belong in\
7:24\
the very organization designed by God to\
help us progress toward the ideal.\
7:30\
Let us leave judgment in the Lord’s\
hands and those He has commissioned\
7:35\
and be content to love and treat\
each other the best we can.\
7:39\
Let us ask Him to show us\
the way, day by day,\
7:42\
“to bring in . . . the poor, and the\
maimed, and the halt, and the blind”—\
7:46\
that is, everyone—to the great\
feast of the Lord.\
7:51\
A second facet of the doctrine of\
belonging has to do with our own\
7:56\
contributions. Although we\
rarely think about it,\
8:01\
much of our belonging comes from our\
service and the sacrifices we make\
8:06\
for others and for the Lord.\
8:10\
Excessive focus on our personal needs,\
8:13\
our own comfort, can frustrate\
that sense of belonging.\
8:18\
We strive to follow the\
Savior’s doctrine:\
8:21\
“Whosoever will be great among\
you, shall be your minister:\
8:25\
. . . For even the Son of man came\
not to be ministered unto,\
8:28\
but to minister, and to give his\
life a ransom for many.”\
8:34\
Belonging comes not as we wait for it\
but as we reach out to help one another.\
8:41\
Today, unfortunately, consecrating\
oneself to a cause\
8:45\
or sacrificing anything for anyone\
else is becoming countercultural.\
8:52\
In a piece for Deseret\
Magazine last year,\
8:55\
author Rod Dreher recounted\
a conversation with\
8:59\
a young mother in Budapest:\
9:02\
“I’m on a Budapest tram with . . .\
a friend in her early 30s—\
9:06\
let’s call her Kristina—while\
we are on the way to interview\
9:10\
an older [Christian] woman\
9:13\
who, with her late husband, withstood\
persecution by the communist state.\
9:19\
As we bump along the city’s streets,\
9:21\
Kristina talks about how hard it is\
to be honest with\
9:27\
friends her age about the struggles\
she faces as a wife\
9:31\
and mother of young children.\
9:34\
Kristina’s difficulties are\
completely ordinary for\
9:37\
a young woman learning how\
to be a mom and a wife—\
9:41\
yet the prevailing attitude among her\
generation is that life’s difficulties\
9:46\
are a threat to one’s well-being\
and should be refused. Do\
9:51\
she and her husband argue at times? Then\
she should leave him, they say.\
9:56\
Are her children annoying her? Then\
she should send them to day care.\
10:02\
Kristina worries that her friends\
don’t grasp that trials,\
10:05\
and even suffering, are a normal part\
of life—and maybe even part of\
10:10\
a good life, if that suffering teaches\
us how to be patient, kind, and loving.\
10:16\
. . . University of Notre Dame\
10:18\
sociologist of religion Christian Smith\
found in his study of adults [ages]\
10:23\
18–23 that most of them believe\
society is nothing more than\
10:30\
‘a collection of autonomous individuals\
out to enjoy life.’”\
10:35\
By this philosophy, anything that one\
finds difficult is\
10:39\
“a form of oppression.”\
10:41\
By contrast, our pioneer forebears\
derived a deep sense of belonging,\
10:47\
unity, and hope in Christ by\
10:50\
the sacrifices they made to serve\
missions, build temples,\
10:55\
abandon comfortable homes under duress\
and begin again,\
10:59\
and in a multitude of other ways\
11:01\
consecrate themselves and their\
means to the cause of Zion.\
11:06\
They were willing to sacrifice even\
their lives if necessary,\
11:10\
and we are all the beneficiaries\
of their endurance.\
11:14\
The same is true for many today who\
may lose family and friends,\
11:18\
forfeit employment opportunities,\
11:20\
or otherwise suffer discrimination\
or intolerance as\
11:24\
a consequence of being baptized.\
11:27\
Their reward, however, is a powerful\
sense of belonging among\
11:32\
the covenant people. Any\
sacrifice we make in\
11:36\
the Lord’s cause helps to confirm\
our place with Him who\
11:39\
gave His life a ransom for many.\
11:44\
The final and most important element\
of the doctrine of belonging is\
11:48\
the central role of Jesus Christ.\
11:51\
We don't join the church\
for fellowship alone,\
11:53\
important as that is. We join for\
redemption through the love\
11:57\
and grace of Jesus Christ.\
11:59\
We join to secure the ordinances of\
salvation and exaltation for ourselves\
12:05\
and those we love on both\
sides of the veil.\
12:08\
We join to participate in\
12:10\
a great project to establish Zion in\
preparation for the Lord's return.\
12:16\
The Church is the custodian of\
the covenants of salvation\
12:20\
and exaltation that God offers\
us through the ordinances of\
12:24\
the Holy Priesthood. It is by keeping\
these covenants that we obtain\
12:29\
the highest and deepest\
sense of belonging.\
12:33\
President Russell M. Nelson\
recently wrote,\
12:36\
“Once you and I have made\
a covenant with God,\
12:39\
our relationship with Him becomes much\
closer than before our covenant.\
12:44\
Now we are bound together. Because\
of our covenant with God,\
12:48\
He will never tire in His\
efforts to help us,\
12:52\
and we will never exhaust His\
merciful patience with us.\
12:56\
Each of us has a special\
place in God’s heart. . . .\
13:00\
Jesus Christ is the guarantor\
of those covenants.”\
13:06\
If we will remember this, the Lord’s\
high hopes for us will inspire,\
13:09\
not discourage, us. We can feel\
joy as we pursue individually,\
13:15\
and communally, “the measure of the\
stature of the fulness of Christ.”\
13:19\
Despite disappointments and setbacks\
along the way, it's a grand quest.\
13:25\
We lift and encourage each other\
in pursuing the upward path,\
13:29\
knowing that no matter tribulation, no\
matter delays in promised blessings,\
13:35\
we can “be of good cheer; [for Christ\
has] overcome the world,”\
13:39\
and we are with Him. Being\
one with the Father,\
13:43\
Son, and Holy Spirit is without doubt\
the ultimate in belonging.\
13:50\
Thus the doctrine of belonging comes\
down to this—each one of us can affirm:\
13:56\
Jesus Christ died for me. He thought\
me worthy of His blood.\
14:01\
He loves me and can make all\
the difference in my life.\
14:04\
As I repent, His grace\
will transform me.\
14:08\
I am one with Him in the\
gospel covenant;\
14:11\
I belong in His Church and kingdom,\
14:14\
and I belong in His cause to bring\
redemption to all of God’s children.\
14:20\
I testify you do belong, in the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
