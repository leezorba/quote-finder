One Sunday, while preparing to\
partake of the sacrament\
0:05\
after several weeks of stake\
conference assignments,\
0:08\
an interesting and powerful thought\
passed through my mind. As\
0:13\
the priest began offering the blessing\
on the bread, words I had heard\
0:17\
so many times before pressed forcefully\
upon my mind and heart:\
0:22\
“And witness unto thee, O God,\
0:25\
the Eternal Father, that they are\
willing to take upon them\
0:30\
the name of thy Son, and always remember\
him, and keep his commandments,\
0:35\
which he has given them; that they may\
always have his Spirit to be with them.”\
0:42\
How many times have we witnessed\
unto God that we are willing?\
0:48\
As I pondered the significance\
of those sacred words,\
0:51\
the word “willing” impressed\
me as never before.\
0:55\
A flood of sweet and sacred experiences\
filled my mind and heart with love\
1:00\
and gratitude for the atoning\
sacrifice of the Savior\
1:05\
and His crucial role in the Father’s\
plan of redemption for my family\
1:10\
and me. Then I heard and felt the\
penetrating words of the prayer on\
1:16\
the water: “that they may witness unto\
thee ... that they do always remember\
1:22\
him.” I understood clearly in that\
moment that keeping my covenants must\
1:27\
be more than good intentions.\
1:30\
Partaking of the sacrament is not\
a passive religious ritual\
1:34\
implying our mere consent.\
1:36\
It is a powerful reminder\
of the reality of\
1:39\
the Savior’s infinite Atonement and\
the need to always remember Him\
1:44\
and keep His commandments. Willingness\
to focus on the Savior is so crucial\
1:50\
it is the central message of the two\
most quoted scriptures in the Church—\
1:54\
the sacrament prayers. Understanding\
1:57\
the truth of what Heavenly Father\
so willingly offers each of us\
2:01\
through His only begotten Son\
2:03\
should evoke our utmost efforts\
to always be willing\
2:07\
in return. Is our own spiritual\
foundation built solidly\
2:12\
on Jesus Christ? If our spiritual\
foundation is shallow or superficial,\
2:19\
we might be inclined to base\
our willingness on\
2:22\
a social cost benefit analysis or\
a personal inconvenience index.\
2:28\
And if we embrace the narrative that\
2:30\
the Church consists primarily\
of outdated\
2:32\
or politically incorrect\
social policies,\
2:35\
unrealistic personal restrictions,\
and time commitments,\
2:39\
then our conclusions about willingness\
will be flawed.\
2:44\
We should not expect the principle of\
willingness to trend positively with\
2:48\
social media influencers\
or Tik Tok enthusiasts.\
2:52\
The precepts of men rarely\
align with divine truth.\
2:58\
The Church is a gathering place for\
imperfect individuals who love God\
3:02\
and who are willing to follow\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
3:06\
That willingness is rooted in the\
reality that Jesus is the Christ,\
3:12\
the Son of the living God.\
3:14\
This divine truth can only be known\
by the power of the Holy Ghost.\
3:20\
Therefore, our willingness is\
directly proportionate to\
3:23\
the amount of time we commit to be in\
holy places where the influence of\
3:28\
the Holy Ghost is present.\
3:31\
We would do well to spend more time in\
meaningful conversation discussing\
3:36\
our concerns with \
a loving Father in Heaven,\
3:40\
and less time seeking the opinions\
of other voices.\
3:44\
We could also choose to change\
our daily news feed to\
3:47\
the words of Christ in the holy\
scriptures and to prophetic words from\
3:52\
His holy living prophets. The importance\
we place on our sabbath\
3:57\
day observance, paying an\
honest tithe, holding\
4:00\
a current temple recommend,\
attending the temple,\
4:03\
and honoring our sacred temple\
4:05\
covenants are all powerful indicators\
of our willingness\
4:09\
and evidence of our commitment.\
4:12\
Are we willing to put forth more than\
4:15\
a superficial effort into strengthening\
our faith in Christ?\
4:20\
Heavenly Father loves us perfectly,\
4:22\
but that love comes with\
great expectations.\
4:26\
He expects us to willingly\
place the Savior at\
4:29\
the very center of our lives.\
4:32\
The Savior is our perfect example\
of willingness to submit to\
4:35\
the Father in all things. He is “the \
way, the truth, and the life.”\
4:42\
He willingly atoned for our sins.\
4:45\
He willingly eases our burdens,\
calms our fears,\
4:49\
gives us strength, and brings peace\
4:52\
and understanding to our hearts in\
times of distress and grief. Yet,\
4:58\
faith in Jesus Christ is a choice.\
5:01\
“If [we] can no more than desire\
to believe [in his words],”\
5:04\
we have a starting point to begin or\
to reset our journey of faith.\
5:11\
His words, if planted in\
our hearts like a seed\
5:14\
and nourished with great\
care, will take root,\
5:17\
and our faith will grow into assurance\
and become a principle of action\
5:22\
and power. The Book of Mormon is our\
most powerful resource for growing\
5:28\
and restoring our faith. Willingness\
is the catalyst of faith.\
5:35\
Mortality by divine design is not easy\
and at times can be overwhelming.\
5:41\
However, “[we] are, that [we] might have\
joy!” Focusing on the Savior\
5:47\
and our covenants brings lasting joy!\
5:51\
The purpose of mortality is\
to prove our willingness.\
5:54\
“The great task of life, and the cost of\
discipleship, is to learn the will of\
6:00\
the Lord and then to do it.” True\
discipleship leads to a fullness of joy.\
6:08\
Are we willing to pay the\
price of discipleship?\
6:12\
The covenant path is not\
a simple checklist.\
6:15\
It is a process of spiritual growth\
and deepening commitment to\
6:19\
the Lord Jesus Christ. The central\
purpose of every commandment, principle,\
6:24\
covenant, and ordinance is to build\
faith and trust in Christ.\
6:29\
Our determination to center our\
lives on Christ, therefore,\
6:33\
must be consistent, not conditional,\
situational, or superficial.\
6:39\
We cannot afford to take vacation days\
6:41\
or personal time off from\
our willingness to “stand\
6:44\
as witnesses of God [in] all times, and\
in all things, and in all places.”\
6:50\
Discipleship is not cheap,\
6:53\
because the companionship of the\
Holy Ghost is priceless.\
6:59\
Surely the Lord was thinking of our\
day as He taught the parable of\
7:03\
the ten virgins. Of the five\
who were wise, He said,\
7:07\
they “have taken the Holy\
Spirit for their guide,\
7:10\
and have not been deceived,”\
7:13\
while the lamps of the foolish\
“are gone out for lack of oil.”\
7:18\
Perhaps the words of Nephi best\
7:21\
best describe these once faithful\
members of the Church: “and others\
7:25\
he will pacify and lull them\
away into carnal security,\
7:30\
that they will say: \
all is well in Zion.”\
7:34\
Carnal security is seeking for\
7:36\
and trusting in worldly things\
instead of Christ.\
7:40\
In other words, looking through\
a secular lens instead of\
7:43\
a spiritual lens. The Holy Ghost gives\
us the capacity to see “things\
7:48\
as they really are and ... as\
they really will be.”\
7:53\
Only “by the power of the Holy Ghost \
[can we] know the truth of all things”\
7:57\
and be not deceived. We place Christ\
at the center of our lives\
8:03\
and pledge our willingness to obey His\
commandments not because we are blind,\
8:08\
but because we can see. What\
about the foolish virgins?\
8:13\
Why were they unwilling to carry\
a vessel of spiritual oil?\
8:17\
Did they simply procrastinate?\
8:19\
They were perhaps too casual\
because it was inconvenient\
8:23\
or seemed unnecessary.\
Whatever the reason,\
8:26\
they were deceived about the\
crucial role of Christ.\
8:30\
This is Satan's fundamental deception\
8:33\
and why their lamps of testimony\
eventually went out\
8:37\
for lack of spiritual oil. This parable\
is a metaphor for our time.\
8:43\
Many leave the Savior and their\
covenants long before they leave His\
8:49\
Church. We live in unprecedented times,\
long foretold by ancient prophets.\
8:55\
A day when Satan rages “in the hearts\
of the children of men,\
8:59\
and [stirs] them up to anger against\
that which is good.”\
9:03\
Far too many of us live in a virtual\
world awash in entertainment\
9:07\
and messaging, hostile to divine\
identity and belief in Christ.\
9:13\
The most powerful spiritual influence\
in the life of a child is\
9:17\
the righteous example of loving parents\
9:20\
and grandparents who faithfully keep\
their own sacred covenants.\
9:25\
Intentional parents teach\
their children faith in\
9:28\
the Lord Jesus Christ so that they\
too “may know to what source\
9:33\
they may look for a remission\
of their sins.”\
9:37\
Casual and inconsistent covenant keeping\
leads to spiritual casualty.\
9:42\
The spiritual damage is often greatest\
on our children and grandchildren.\
9:48\
Parents and grandparents,\
are we still willing?\
9:53\
President Nelson has warned that “in\
coming days it will not be possible to\
9:57\
survive spiritually without\
the guiding, directing,\
10:00\
comforting, and constant influence\
of the Holy Ghost.”\
10:04\
This is a clear and unmistakable\
warning to trim our lamps\
10:08\
and increase our spiritual oil reserves.\
10:12\
Are we still willing to follow\
the living prophets?\
10:16\
What is the level of spiritual\
oil in your lamp?\
10:20\
What changes in your personal life\
would enable you to have\
10:23\
the influence of the Holy\
Ghost more constantly?\
10:27\
Today, as in the times of Jesus,\
10:30\
there will be those who will turn back,\
10:33\
unwilling to accept the price of\
discipleship. As harsh and hateful\
10:37\
criticism is increasingly leveled\
at the Savior’s Church\
10:41\
and those who follow Him,\
10:43\
our discipleship will require a greater\
willingness to straighten\
10:47\
and strengthen our spiritual\
spines and “heed them not.”\
10:52\
If our spiritual foundation is\
built solidly on Jesus Christ,\
10:56\
we will not fall and we need not fear.\
11:00\
“Behold, the Lord requireth the heart\
and a willing mind; and the willing\
11:04\
and obedient shall eat the good of the\
land of Zion in these last days.”\
11:08\
May we always be willing.\
11:10\
In the sacred name of the\
Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
