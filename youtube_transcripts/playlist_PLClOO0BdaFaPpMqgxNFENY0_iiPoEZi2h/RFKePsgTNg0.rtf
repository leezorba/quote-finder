My dear brothers and sisters,\
0:01\
I'm grateful to greet you on this\
glorious Sabbath morning.\
0:07\
You are constantly on my mind.\
0:10\
I marvel at the way you spring into\
action whenever you see others in need.\
0:17\
I stand amazed at the faith and\
testimony you demonstrate\
0:22\
again and again.\
0:26\
I weep over your heartaches,\
disappointments, and worries.\
0:34\
I love you. I assure you that our\
Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son,\
0:40\
Jesus Christ, love you. They are\
intimately aware of your circumstances,\
0:49\
your goodness, your needs, and your\
prayers for help. Again and again,\
0:56\
I pray for you to feel\
Their love for you.\
1:03\
Experiencing Their love is vital, as it\
seems that we are accosted daily\
1:13\
by an onslaught of sobering news.\
1:18\
You may have had days when you wished\
you could don your pajamas,\
1:22\
curl up in a ball, and ask someone to\
awaken you when the turmoil is over.\
1:31\
But my dear brothers and sisters, so\
many wonderful things are ahead.\
1:37\
In coming days, we will see the\
greatest manifestations of\
1:41\
the Savior’s power that the\
world has ever seen.\
1:47\
Between now and the time He returns\
“with power in great glory,”\
1:53\
He will bestow countless privileges,\
1:56\
blessings, and miracles\
upon the faithful.\
2:03\
Nonetheless, we are presently\
living in what surely is\
2:07\
a most complicated time in\
the history of the world.\
2:12\
The complexities and challenges leave\
many people feeling overwhelmed\
2:17\
and exhausted. However, consider\
2:23\
a recent experience that might shed\
light on how you and I can find rest.\
2:31\
During the recent open house of\
the Washington D.C. Temple,\
2:35\
a member of the open house committee\
witnessed an insight and\
2:41\
an interchange as he escorted several\
prominent journalists through\
2:45\
the temple. Somehow a young family\
became attached to this media tour.\
2:55\
One reporter kept asking about the\
“journey” of temple patrons as he\
3:00\
or she moves through the temple.\
3:04\
He wanted to know if the temple journey\
is symbolic of the challenges in\
3:08\
a person's journey through life.\
3:12\
A young boy in the family picked\
up on the conversation.\
3:17\
When the tour group entered\
an endowment room,\
3:21\
the boy pointed to the altar where\
people kneel to make covenants with God,\
3:28\
and said, “Oh, that’s nice.\
3:31\
Here’s a place for people to rest\
on their temple journey.”\
3:40\
I doubt that the boy knew just how\
profound his observation was.\
3:46\
He likely had no idea about the direct\
connection between making\
3:52\
a covenant with God in the temple and\
the Savior’s stunning promise:\
4:00\
“Come unto me, all ye\
that labour and are heavy\
4:03\
laden, and I will give you rest.\
4:06\
“Take my yoke upon you,\
and learn of me; ...\
4:09\
and ye shall find rest unto your\
souls. “For my yoke is easy,\
4:16\
and my burden is light.”\
4:22\
Dear brothers and sisters,\
4:23\
I grieve for those who leave the Church\
4:26\
because they feel membership\
requires too much of them.\
4:31\
They have not yet discovered\
that making\
4:34\
and keeping covenants actually\
makes life easier!\
4:41\
Each person who makes covenants\
in baptismal fonts and temples—\
4:47\
and keeps them—has increased access\
to the power of Jesus Christ.\
4:55\
Please ponder that stunning truth!\
5:00\
The reward for keeping covenants\
with God is heavenly power—\
5:05\
power that strengthens us to withstand\
our trials, temptations, and heartaches\
5:11\
better. This power eases our way.\
5:18\
Those who live the higher laws of Jesus\
Christ have access to His higher power.\
5:27\
Thus, covenant keepers are entitled to\
5:31\
a special kind of rest that comes\
to them through their covenantal\
5:36\
relationship with God.\
5:41\
Before the Savior submitted Himself to\
the agony of Gethsemane and Calvary,\
5:47\
He declared to His Apostles,\
5:50\
“In the world ye shall\
have tribulation:\
5:55\
but be of good cheer; I have\
overcome the world.”\
6:02\
Subsequently, Jesus entreated\
each of us to do the same\
6:08\
when He said, “I will that ye\
should overcome the world.”\
6:16\
Dear brothers and sisters,\
6:17\
my message to you today is that\
6:19\
because Jesus Christ overcame this\
fallen world and because He atoned\
6:25\
for each of us, you too can overcome\
this sin-saturated,\
6:32\
self-centered, and often\
exhausting world.\
6:39\
Because the Savior, through\
His infinite Atonement,\
6:42\
redeemed each of us from weakness,\
mistakes, and sin,\
6:49\
and because He experienced every pain,\
worry, and burden you have ever had,\
6:56\
then, as you truly repent\
and seek His help,\
6:59\
you can rise above this present\
precarious world.\
7:05\
You can overcome\
7:07\
the spiritually and emotionally\
exhausting plagues of the world,\
7:13\
including arrogance, pride,\
anger, immorality, hatred, greed,\
7:22\
jealousy, and fear.\
Despite the distractions\
7:27\
and distortions that swirl around us,\
you can find true rest—\
7:34\
meaning relief and peace—even amid\
your most vexing problems.\
7:43\
This important truth prompts three\
fundamental questions:\
7:49\
First, what does it mean to overcome\
the world? Second, how do we do it?\
7:57\
And third, how does overcoming\
the world bless our lives?\
8:06\
What does it mean to\
overcome the world?\
8:10\
It means overcoming the temptation\
8:14\
to care more about things of this\
world than the things of God.\
8:21\
It means trusting the doctrines\
of Christ more than\
8:26\
the philosophies of men. It\
means delighting in truth,\
8:33\
denouncing deception, and becoming\
“humble followers of Christ.”\
8:41\
It means choosing to refrain from\
anything that drives the Spirit away.\
8:48\
It means being willing to “give\
away” even our favorite sins.\
8:59\
Now, overcoming the world certainly does\
not mean becoming perfect in this\
9:03\
life, nor does it mean that your\
problems will magically evaporate—\
9:08\
because they won’t. And it does not mean\
that you won’t still make\
9:16\
mistakes. But overcoming the world does\
mean that your resistance to sin will\
9:25\
increase. Your heart will soften as your\
faith in Jesus Christ increases.\
9:34\
Overcoming the world means\
growing to love God\
9:37\
and His Beloved Son more than you\
love anyone or anything else.\
9:46\
How, then, do we overcome the world?\
King Benjamin taught us how.\
9:54\
He said that “the natural man is an\
enemy to God” and remains so forever\
10:01\
“unless he yields to the enticings\
of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off\
10:06\
the natural man and becometh a saint\
10:11\
through the atonement of\
Christ the Lord.”\
10:17\
Each time you seek for and follow\
the promptings of the Spirit,\
10:21\
each time you do anything good—things\
that the natural man would not do—\
10:29\
you are overcoming the world.\
10:34\
Overcoming the world is not an event\
that happens in a day or two.\
10:41\
It happens over a lifetime\
as we repeatedly embrace\
10:46\
the doctrine of Christ. We cultivate\
faith in Jesus Christ by repenting\
10:54\
daily and keeping covenants\
that endow us with power.\
11:00\
We stay on the covenant path and are\
blessed with spiritual strength,\
11:05\
personal revelation, increasing faith,\
and the ministering of angels.\
11:14\
Living the doctrine of Christ can\
produce the most powerful\
11:18\
virtuous cycle, creating spiritual\
momentum in our lives.\
11:26\
As we strive to live the higher\
laws of Jesus Christ,\
11:30\
our hearts and our very natures\
begin to change.\
11:37\
The Savior lifts us above\
11:39\
the pull of this fallen world by\
blessing us with greater charity,\
11:44\
humility, generosity, kindness,\
11:48\
self-discipline, peace, and rest.\
11:57\
Now, you may be thinking this sounds\
more like hard spiritual work\
12:01\
rather than rest.\
12:05\
But here’s the grand truth:\
12:08\
While the world insists that\
power, possessions,\
12:13\
popularity, and pleasures of the flesh\
bring happiness, they do not!\
12:22\
They cannot! What they do produce is\
nothing but a hollow substitute\
12:30\
for the “blessed and happy\
state of those [who]\
12:33\
keep the commandments of God.”\
12:37\
The truth is that it is much more\
exhausting to seek happiness\
12:43\
where you can never find it!\
12:47\
However, when you yoke yourself\
to Jesus Christ and do\
12:52\
the spiritual work required\
to overcome the world,\
12:57\
He, and He alone, does have the power to\
lift you above the pull of this world.\
13:08\
Now, how does overcoming the world bless\
our lives? The answer is clear:\
13:16\
Entering into a covenant relationship\
with God binds us to Him in\
13:23\
a way that makes everything\
about life easier.\
13:30\
Please do not misunderstand me:\
13:32\
I did not say that making covenants\
makes life easy. In fact,\
13:39\
expect opposition,\
13:42\
because the adversary does not want you\
to discover the power of Jesus Christ.\
13:49\
But yoking yourself with the Savior\
means you have access to His strength\
13:57\
and redeeming power.\
14:02\
I reaffirm a profound teaching of\
President Ezra Taft Benson:\
14:07\
“Men and women who turn their\
lives over to God will discover that He\
14:13\
can make a lot more out of their\
lives than they can.\
14:17\
He will deepen their joys, expand their\
vision, quicken their minds, ...\
14:22\
lift their spirits, multiply their\
blessings, increase their opportunities,\
14:27\
comfort their souls, raise up friends,\
and pour out peace.”\
14:37\
These incomparable challenges\
follow those who seek\
14:41\
the support of heaven to help\
them overcome this world.\
14:47\
To this end, I extend to members of\
the entire Church the same charge\
14:52\
I gave to our young adults last May.\
I urged them then—\
15:00\
and I plead with you now—to take charge\
of your own testimony of Jesus Christ\
15:07\
and His gospel. Work for it. Nurture it\
so that it will grow. Feed it truth.\
15:14\
Don’t pollute it with false philosophies\
of unbelieving men\
15:18\
and women. As you make the continual\
strengthening of your testimony of\
15:25\
Jesus Christ your highest priority,\
15:29\
watch for miracles to\
happen in your life.\
15:36\
My plea to you this morning\
is to find rest\
15:40\
from the intensity, uncertainty,\
and anguish\
15:45\
of this world by overcoming the world\
through your covenants with God.\
15:54\
Let Him know through your prayers\
15:56\
and your actions that you are serious\
about overcoming the world.\
16:01\
Ask Him to enlighten your mind\
and send the help you need.\
16:07\
Each day, record the thoughts that\
come to you as you pray;\
16:12\
then follow through diligently.\
16:16\
Spend more time in the temple,\
and seek to understand how\
16:20\
the temple teaches you how to rise\
above this fallen world.\
16:29\
As I've stated before, the\
gathering of Israel is\
16:31\
the most important work taking\
place on earth today.\
16:35\
One crucial element of this gathering\
is preparing a people who are able,\
16:43\
ready, and worthy to receive the\
Lord when He comes again;\
16:48\
a people who have already chosen Jesus\
Christ over this fallen world;\
16:55\
a people who rejoice in their\
agency to live the higher,\
16:59\
holier laws of Jesus Christ.\
17:06\
I call upon you, my dear\
brothers and sisters,\
17:09\
to become this righteous people.\
17:14\
Cherish and honor your covenant\
above all other commitments.\
17:20\
As you let God prevail in your life, I\
promise you greater peace, confidence,\
17:26\
joy, and yes, rest.\
17:34\
With the power of the holy apostleship\
vested in me,\
17:38\
I bless you in your quest\
to overcome this world.\
17:44\
I bless you to increase your\
faith in Jesus Christ\
17:49\
and learn better how to\
draw upon His power.\
17:54\
I bless you to be able to discern\
truth from error.\
17:59\
I bless you to care more about\
the things of God than\
18:02\
the things of this world.\
18:06\
I bless you to see the needs\
of those around you\
18:10\
and strengthen those you love.\
18:14\
Because Jesus Christ overcame\
this world, you can too.\
18:22\
I so testify in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
