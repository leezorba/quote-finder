While visiting our native\
country of France,\
0:04\
my wife and I recently had\
the pleasure of taking\
0:07\
a few of our grandchildren to explore\
a magnificent garden situated in\
0:12\
the little town of Giverny.\
0:15\
We enjoyed wandering along its paths to\
admire the beautiful flower beds,\
0:19\
the elegant water lilies, and the\
light playing on the ponds.\
0:25\
This amazing place is the result of\
the creative passion of one man,\
0:29\
the great painter Claude Monet,\
0:32\
who, for 40 years, tenderly shaped\
0:34\
and cultivated his garden to make\
it his painting workspace.\
0:39\
Monet immersed himself\
in nature’s splendor;\
0:43\
then, with his paintbrush,\
0:45\
he conveyed the impressions he felt\
with strokes of color and light.\
0:51\
Over the years, he created\
0:52\
an extraordinary collection of hundreds\
of paintings directly inspired by\
0:58\
his garden. Brothers and sisters,\
1:01\
our interactions with the beauties of\
nature around us can produce some of\
1:06\
the most inspiring and delightful\
experiences in life.\
1:10\
The emotions we feel kindled within us\
1:14\
a deep sense of gratitude for our\
Heavenly Father and His Son,\
1:18\
Jesus Christ, who created this\
magnificent earth with its mountains\
1:23\
and streams, plants and animals, and\
our first parents, Adam and Eve.\
1:29\
The work of creation is\
not an end in itself.\
1:32\
It is an integral part of God’s\
plan for His children.\
1:37\
Its purpose is to provide a setting in\
which men and women may be tested,\
1:43\
exercise their agency, find\
joy, and learn and progress\
1:48\
so that they may one day return to\
the presence of their Creator\
1:51\
and inherit eternal life.\
1:54\
These wonderful creations were prepared\
entirely for our benefit\
2:00\
and are living proof of the love the\
Creator has for His children.\
2:05\
The Lord declared, “Yea, all things\
which come of the earth ... are made for\
2:10\
the benefit and the use of man,\
2:13\
both to please the eye and\
to gladden the heart.”\
2:17\
However, the divine gift of creation\
does not come without duties\
2:22\
and responsibilities. These duties\
are best described by\
2:26\
the concept of “stewardship.”\
2:29\
In gospel terms, the word “stewardship”\
designates a sacred\
2:34\
spiritual or temporal responsibility to\
take care of something that belongs\
2:38\
to God for which we are accountable.\
As taught in the holy scriptures,\
2:44\
our earthly stewardship includes\
the following principles.\
2:49\
First principle: the entire earth,\
including all life thereon,\
2:55\
belongs to God. The Creator has\
entrusted the earth’s resources\
3:00\
and all forms of life to our care,\
but He retains full ownership.\
3:05\
He said, “I, the Lord stretched out\
the heavens, and built the earth,\
3:11\
my very handiwork; and all\
things therein are mine.”\
3:16\
All that is on the earth belongs\
to God, including our families,\
3:20\
our physical bodies, and\
even our very lives.\
3:24\
Second principle: As stewards\
of God’s creations,\
3:28\
we have a duty to honor\
and care for them.\
3:32\
As God’s children, we have received\
a charge to be stewards,\
3:37\
caretakers, and guardians of\
His divine creations.\
3:40\
The Lord said that He made\
“every man accountable, as\
3:45\
a steward of our earthly blessings,\
3:47\
which I have made and prepared\
for my creatures.”\
3:53\
Our Heavenly Father allows us to use\
earthly resources according to our own\
3:57\
free will. Yet our agency should not\
be interpreted as license to use\
4:04\
or consume the riches of this world\
without wisdom or restraint.\
4:09\
The Lord gave this admonition:\
4:11\
“And it pleaseth God that He has given\
all these things unto man;\
4:16\
for unto this end were they made to be\
used, with judgment, not to excess,\
4:22\
neither by extortion.” President Russell\
M. Nelson once remarked, quote,\
4:29\
“As beneficiaries of the divine\
Creation, what shall we do?\
4:34\
We should care for the earth,\
be wise stewards over it,\
4:37\
and preserve it for future generations.”\
Close quote.\
4:42\
Beyond being simply a scientific\
or political necessity,\
4:47\
the care of the earth and of\
our natural environment is\
4:51\
a sacred responsibility entrusted\
to us by God,\
4:55\
which should fill us with a deep\
sense of duty and humility.\
5:00\
It is also an integral component\
of our discipleship.\
5:04\
How can we honor and love Heavenly\
Father and Jesus Christ without\
5:09\
honoring and loving Their creations?\
5:12\
There are many things that\
we can do collectively\
5:15\
and individually to be good stewards.\
5:19\
Considering our individual\
circumstances,\
5:22\
each of us can use the bountiful\
resources of the earth more reverently\
5:27\
and prudently. We can support community\
efforts to care for the earth.\
5:32\
We can adopt personal lifestyles\
5:34\
and behaviors that respect\
God's creations\
5:38\
and make our own living spaces tidier,\
more beautiful, and more inspirational.\
5:45\
Our stewardship over God's creations\
also includes, at its pinnacle,\
5:51\
a sacred duty to love, respect, and care\
5:55\
for all human beings with\
whom we share the earth.\
5:58\
They are sons and daughters of God,\
our sisters and our brothers,\
6:03\
and their eternal happiness\
is the very purpose of\
6:06\
the work of creation. The author\
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\
6:11\
recounted the following. One day,\
while traveling on a train,\
6:17\
he found himself sitting amidst\
a group of refugees.\
6:22\
Deeply moved by the hopelessness he\
saw in the face of a young child,\
6:26\
he exclaimed: “When by mutation a\
new rose is born in the garden,\
6:31\
all the gardeners rejoice. They isolate\
the rose, tend it, foster it.\
6:37\
But there is no gardener for man.”\
My brothers and sisters,\
6:42\
should we not be the gardeners\
for our fellow men and women?\
6:46\
Are we not our brother's keeper?\
6:49\
Jesus commanded us to love our\
neighbor as ourselves.\
6:53\
From His mouth, the word “neighbor” does\
not merely mean geographic proximity.\
6:59\
It implies the proximity of the heart.\
7:03\
It encompasses all the inhabitants\
of this planet,\
7:06\
whether they live near us\
or in a faraway country,\
7:09\
regardless of their origins, personal\
backgrounds, or circumstances.\
7:15\
As disciples of Christ, we have a\
solemn duty to work tirelessly\
7:19\
for peace and harmony among\
all nations of the earth.\
7:24\
We must do our very best to protect\
and bring solace and relief to\
7:28\
the weak, the needy, and all those\
who suffer or who are oppressed.\
7:34\
Above all, the greatest gift of love we\
can offer our fellow men is to share\
7:39\
with them the joy of the gospel\
and invite them to come\
7:43\
unto their Savior through sacred\
covenants and ordinances.\
7:48\
Third principle: We are invited to\
participate in the work of creation.\
7:54\
The divine process of creation\
is not yet complete.\
7:57\
Every day, God’s creations continue\
to grow, expand, and multiply.\
8:03\
The most wonderful thing is that our\
Heavenly Father extends to us\
8:07\
an invitation to participate\
in His creative work.\
8:11\
We participate in the work of creation\
whenever we cultivate the earth\
8:16\
or add our own constructions\
to this world,\
8:19\
as long as we show respect\
for God’s creations.\
8:23\
Our contributions may be expressed\
through the creation of works of art,\
8:27\
architecture, music, literature, and\
culture, which embellish our planet,\
8:33\
quicken our senses, and\
brighten our lives.\
8:36\
We also contribute through scientific\
and medical discoveries that preserve\
8:41\
the earth and life upon it.\
8:43\
President Thomas S. Monson summarized\
this concept with these beautiful words,\
8:49\
quote, “God left the world unfinished\
for man to work his skill upon ...\
8:55\
that man might know the joys\
and glories of creation,”\
8:59\
close quote. In Jesus’s parable\
of the talents, when\
9:04\
the master returned from His journey,\
9:05\
he praised and rewarded the\
two servants who grew\
9:09\
and magnified their talents.\
9:12\
In contrast, he called the servant who\
hid his unique talent in the earth\
9:16\
“unprofitable,” and he took away even\
that which he had received.\
9:21\
Similarly, our role as stewards of\
earthly creations is not solely about\
9:26\
conserving or preserving them.\
9:29\
The Lord expects us to work diligently,\
9:32\
as moved upon by His Holy\
Spirit, to grow,\
9:35\
enhance, and improve upon the resources\
He has entrusted to us—\
9:39\
not for our benefit only,\
but to bless others.\
9:44\
Among all of man's achievements,\
9:47\
none can equal the experience of\
becoming cocreators with God in giving\
9:52\
life or in helping a child learn, grow,\
and thrive, whether it be as parents,\
9:58\
teachers, leaders, or in any other role.\
10:01\
There is no stewardship more sacred,\
more fulfilling,\
10:05\
and also more demanding than that of\
partnering with our Creator in\
10:09\
providing physical bodies\
for His spirit children,\
10:12\
and then helping them reach\
their divine potential.\
10:17\
The responsibility of co-creation serves\
as a constant reminder that life\
10:22\
and each person's body are sacred, that\
they belong to none other than God,\
10:28\
and that He has made us guardians to\
respect, protect, and care for them.\
10:34\
The commandments of God which govern\
the powers of procreation and\
10:37\
the establishment of eternal families\
guide us in this holy stewardship which\
10:42\
is so crucial to His plan.\
My brothers and sisters,\
10:47\
we should recognize that all\
is spiritual to the Lord—\
10:51\
including the most temporal\
aspects of our lives.\
10:55\
I testify that great spiritual blessings\
are promised to those who\
11:01\
love and care for the earth and\
their fellow men and women.\
11:05\
As you stay faithful in this\
sacred stewardship\
11:08\
and honor your eternal covenants,\
11:10\
you will grow in the knowledge of God\
and of His Son, Jesus Christ,\
11:14\
and you will feel Their love and Their\
influence more abundantly in your life.\
11:20\
All this will prepare you\
to dwell with Them\
11:23\
and receive additional creative\
power in the life to come.\
11:28\
At the end of this\
mortal existence,\
11:30\
the Master will ask us to give an\
account of our sacred stewardship,\
11:35\
including how we have cared\
for His creations.\
11:39\
I pray that we will then hear His loving\
words whispered to our hearts:\
11:45\
“Well done, thou good and\
faithful servant:\
11:49\
thou hast been faithful\
over a few things,\
11:52\
I will make thee ruler\
over many things:\
11:56\
enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.”\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
