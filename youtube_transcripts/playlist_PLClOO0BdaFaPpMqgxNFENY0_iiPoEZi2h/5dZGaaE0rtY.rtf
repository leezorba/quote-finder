Dear brothers and sisters,\
0:03\
during these five magnificent sessions\
of general conference,\
0:07\
we have once again experienced\
that the heavens are open.\
0:13\
I pray that you have recorded\
your impressions\
0:15\
and will follow through with them.\
0:20\
Our Heavenly Father and His\
beloved Son, Jesus Christ,\
0:24\
stand ready to help you. I\
urge you to increase your\
0:29\
efforts to seek Their help.\
0:34\
Recently, Sister Nelson and I had\
the opportunity to preview\
0:38\
the new season four of the Book\
of Mormon Videos series.\
0:45\
We were inspired by them!\
0:48\
May I show you a brief excerpt from\
0:52\
the scene depicting the Savior’s\
appearance to the Nephites?\
1:06\
(barely audible)\
Behold my beloved son.\
1:13\
(barely audible)\
Behold my beloved son.\
1:22\
Behold, my Beloved Son...\
In whom I am well pleased,\
1:28\
in whom I have glorified\
my name — hear ye him.\
2:15\
Behold,\
I am Jesus Christ,\
2:20\
whom the prophets\
testified shall come into the world.\
2:25\
And behold, I am the light\
and the life of the world;\
2:29\
and I have drunk out of that bitter cup\
which the Father hath given me,\
2:35\
and have glorified the Father in\
taking upon me the sins of the world\
2:39\
in the which I have suffered the\
will of the Father\
2:42\
in all things from the beginning.\
2:46\
Arise...\
2:47\
...And come forth unto me... that ye\
may thrust your hands into my side...\
2:55\
And also that ye may feel\
the prints of the nails\
2:58\
in my hands and in my feet,\
3:00\
that ye may know that I am the God of\
Israel, and the God of the whole earth,\
3:07\
and have been slain for\
the sins of the world.\

It is significant that the Savior chose\
to appear to the people at the temple.\
3:57\
It is His house. It is\
filled with His power.\
4:03\
Let us never lose sight of what\
the Lord is doing for us now.\
4:09\
He is making His temples\
more accessible.\
4:13\
He is accelerating the pace at which\
we are building temples.\
4:18\
He is increasing our ability\
to help gather Israel.\
4:23\
He is also making it easier for each of\
us to become spiritually refined.\
4:30\
I promise that increased time in\
4:32\
the temple will bless your life\
in ways nothing else can.\
4:38\
We currently have 168\
4:42\
operating temples and 53 new temples\
are under construction,\
4:52\
and another 54 in the preconstruction\
design phase.\
5:01\
I am pleased to announce\
our plans to build a new temple\
5:06\
in each of following locations:\
5:11\
Busan, Korea;\
5:13\
Naga, Philippines;\
5:16\
Santiago, Philippines.\
5:19\
Eked, Nigeria;\
5:22\
Chiclayo, Peru;\
5:26\
Buenos Aires City Center, Argentina;\
5:31\
Londrina, Brazil;\
5:35\
Ribeirão Prêto, Brazil;\
5:38\
Huehuetenango, Guatemala;\
5:43\
Jacksonville, Florida;\
5:46\
Grand Rapids, Michigan;\
5:50\
Prosper, Texas;\
5:53\
Lone Mountain, Nevada;\
5:56\
and Tacoma, Washington.\
6:00\
We are also planning to build multiple\
temples in selected large metropolitan\
6:07\
areas where travel time to an existing\
temple is a major challenge.\
6:14\
Therefore, I am pleased to announce\
four additional temples\
6:18\
near Mexico City, where new\
temples will be built\
6:23\
in Cuernavaca,\
6:25\
Pachuca,\
6:27\
Toluca,\
6:28\
and Tula.\
6:30\
My dear\
brothers and sisters,\
6:34\
may you focus on the temple in\
ways you never have before.\
6:40\
I bless you to grow closer to God and\
Jesus Christ every day. I love you.\
6:54\
May God be with you till we meet again.\
6:59\
I pray in the sacred name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
