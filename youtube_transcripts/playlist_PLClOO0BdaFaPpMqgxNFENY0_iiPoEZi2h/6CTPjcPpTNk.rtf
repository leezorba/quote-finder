During this past summer,\
over 200,000\
0:05\
of our young people all over the\
world grew in faith at one of\
0:09\
the hundreds of week-long sessions\
of For the Strength of Youth,\
0:14\
or FSY Conferences. Coming as they were\
out of a world of pandemic isolation,\
0:20\
for many it was an act of faith\
in the Lord to even attend.\
0:24\
Many of the young participants\
seemed to follow\
0:27\
a similar upward arc towards deeper\
conversion. At the end of their week,\
0:32\
I liked to ask them, “So how’s it been?”\
0:36\
And they sometimes said\
something like this:\
0:39\
“Well, on Monday, I was so annoyed with\
my mother because she made me come\
0:45\
and do this, and I didn’t know anybody,\
and I didn’t think it was for me, and\
0:50\
I wouldn’t have any friends.\
But now it’s Friday,\
0:54\
and I just want to stay here. I just\
want to feel the Spirit in my life.\
1:00\
I want to live like this.”\
1:03\
They each have their own\
stories to tell\
1:06\
of moments of clarity and of spiritual\
gifts washing through them\
1:11\
and carrying them along\
that arc of growth.\
1:14\
I, too, was changed this summer\
of FSY as I have seen\
1:18\
the Spirit of God relentlessly\
responding to the righteous desires of\
1:24\
the individual hearts of these young\
multitudes, who individually found\
1:28\
the courage to trust Him, with\
a week in His keeping.\
1:33\
Like brightly hulled steel ships at sea,\
1:36\
we live in a spiritually corrosive\
environment where\
1:40\
the most gleaming convictions must\
be mindfully maintained\
1:45\
or they can etch, and then corrode,\
and then crumble away.\
1:50\
Experiences like FSY conferences\
and camps and missions\
1:55\
and sacrament meetings can help\
to burnish our testimonies,\
1:58\
taking us through arcs of growth\
2:01\
and spiritual discovery to\
places of relative peace.\
2:05\
But what must we do to stay there and\
continue to “press forward with\
2:11\
a steadfastness in Christ” rather\
than slipping backwards?\
2:16\
We must continue to do those things\
that brought us there in\
2:18\
the first place like praying\
2:21\
often, drenching ourselves in scripture,\
and serving sincerely.\
2:26\
For some of us, it may require\
an exercise in trusting in\
2:30\
the Lord even to attend\
sacrament meeting.\
2:33\
But once there, the healing\
influence of\
2:36\
the Lord’s sacrament, infusions of\
gospel principles, and the nurture of\
2:41\
the Church community can send us home\
on higher ground. At FSY\
2:47\
a couple of hundred thousand and more\
of our youth came to better know\
2:50\
the Savior by using a simple formula\
of coming together where two\
2:55\
or more of them were gathered\
in His name,\
2:58\
engaging the gospel and the scriptures,\
singing together, praying together,\
3:03\
and finding peace in Christ.\
3:06\
This is a powerful prescription\
for spiritual awakening.\
3:11\
Now this far-flung band\
of young brothers\
3:14\
and sisters has gone home to determine\
what it means to still trust in\
3:19\
the Lord when swept up in the cacophony\
of a rambunctious world.\
3:24\
It’s one thing to hear Him in our quiet\
place of contemplation with scriptures\
3:30\
wide open, but it is quite another thing\
to carry our discipleship into\
3:35\
this mortal flurry of distractions\
where we must strive to hear Him,\
3:39\
even through the blur of self-concern\
and faltering confidence.\
3:45\
Let there be no doubt, it is\
3:47\
the very stuff of heroes displayed by\
our youth when they set their hearts\
3:53\
and minds to standing\
upright against\
3:58\
the shifting moral tectonics\
of our time.\
4:02\
I once served as husband to the\
stake Young Women’s president.\
4:07\
One night I was tasked with\
arranging cookies in\
4:09\
the foyer while my wife was conducting\
a fireside in the chapel for parents\
4:14\
and their daughters preparing to\
attend Young Women’s Camp\
4:17\
the next week. After she explained\
where they needed to be\
4:21\
and what to bring, she said, “Now,\
Tuesday morning,\
4:26\
when you drop your sweet\
girls off at the bus,\
4:29\
you hug them tight and\
you kiss them goodbye,\
4:32\
because they’re not coming back.”\
4:36\
I heard someone gasp, and\
then I realized it was me.\
4:41\
“Not coming back?” But then\
she continued, she said,\
4:45\
“When you drop those Tuesday\
morning girls off,\
4:48\
they will leave behind the distraction\
of lesser things and spend\
4:52\
a week together learning and growing\
and trusting in the Lord.\
4:56\
We will pray together and sing\
and cook and serve together\
5:00\
and share testimonies together and do\
5:03\
the things that allow us to feel\
Heavenly Father’s Spirit all week long\
5:07\
until it soaks all the\
way into our bones.\
5:11\
And on Saturday, those girls that you\
see getting off that bus will not be\
5:17\
the ones you dropped off on Tuesday.\
They will be new creatures.\
5:22\
And if you help them continue from that\
higher plane, they will astonish you.\
5:28\
They will continue to change and\
to grow, and so will your family.”\
5:34\
Well, on that Saturday, it was\
just as she predicted.\
5:38\
As I was loading tents, I heard\
my wife's voice off in\
5:42\
the little woodsy amphitheater where the\
girls had gathered before heading\
5:46\
for home. I heard her say, “Oh,\
there you are.\
5:52\
We’ve been watching for you all week,\
our Saturday girls.”\
5:59\
The stalwart youth of Zion are voyaging\
through stunning times.\
6:04\
Finding joy in this world of prophesied\
disruption without becoming part “of\
6:10\
that world,” with its blind spot toward\
holiness, is their particular charge.\
6:18\
About a hundred years ago,\
6:19\
G.K. Chesterton spoke almost\
as though he saw this quest\
6:23\
as being home centered\
and Church supported\
6:26\
when he said, “We have to feel\
the universe at once as\
6:30\
an ogre’s castle, to be stormed,\
6:33\
and yet as our own cottage, to which\
we can return to at evening.”\
6:39\
Thankfully, they don't have to\
go out into battle alone.\
6:42\
They have each other and they have you,\
and they follow a living Prophet,\
6:47\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
6:49\
who leads with the knowing optimism\
of a seer in proclaiming that\
6:55\
the great endeavor of these times—\
the gathering of Israel—\
6:59\
will be both grand and majestic.\
7:04\
This summer, my wife Colleen and I were\
changing planes in Amsterdam,\
7:09\
where, many years earlier, I was\
a new missionary. When\
7:14\
after months of struggling\
to learn Dutch,\
7:17\
our group’s KLM flight was landing,\
and the captain made\
7:22\
an incoherent announcement\
over the PA system.\
7:27\
After a moment of silence, my companion\
mumbled, “I think that was Dutch.”\
7:33\
We glanced up, reading\
each other’s thoughts,\
7:37\
“All was lost.” But all was not lost.\
7:43\
As I marveled over the leaps of\
faith that we had taken then,\
7:48\
as my companions walked through\
this airport on our way to\
7:51\
the miracles that would rain down\
upon us as missionaries,\
7:55\
I was brought abruptly back\
to the present by a living,\
7:59\
breathing missionary who was\
boarding a plane home.\
8:02\
He introduced himself and asked,\
“President Lund, what do I do now?\
8:07\
What do I do to remain strong?”\
8:11\
Well, this is the same\
question that is on\
8:14\
the minds of our youth when they leave\
FSY conferences and youth camps\
8:17\
and temple trips, and any time they\
feel the powers of heaven.\
8:21\
“How can loving God turn into\
lasting discipleship?”\
8:26\
I felt an upwelling of love for\
this missionary serving\
8:30\
the last hours of his mission, and in\
that momentary stillness of the Spirit,\
8:35\
I heard my voice crack\
8:37\
as I said simply, “You don’t have to\
wear the badge to bear His name.”\
8:43\
I wanted to put my hands\
on his shoulders\
8:48\
and say, “Here’s what you do. You\
go home and you just be this.\
8:55\
You are so good you almost\
glow in the dark.\
8:57\
Your mission disciplines and\
sacrifices have made you\
9:01\
a magnificent son of God.\
9:03\
Keep doing at home what has worked\
so powerfully for you here.\
9:06\
You've learned to pray and to whom you\
pray and the language of prayer.\
9:11\
You have studied His words\
and come to love\
9:13\
the Savior by trying to be like Him.\
9:15\
You’ve loved Heavenly Father like He\
loved His Father, served others\
9:20\
like He served others, and lived the\
commandments like He lived them.\
9:23\
And when you didn't, you've repented.\
9:27\
Your discipleship isn’t just\
a slogan on a T-shirt—\
9:31\
it has become a part of your life\
purposely lived for others.\
9:37\
So you go home, and you do that.\
9:39\
Be that. Carry this spiritual momentum\
into the rest of your life.”\
9:45\
I know that through trusting in\
9:47\
the Lord Jesus Christ and\
His covenant path,\
9:49\
we can find spiritual confidence and\
peace as we nurture holy habits\
9:53\
and righteous routines that can sustain\
and fuel the fires of our faith.\
9:59\
May we each move ever closer\
to those warming fires,\
10:03\
and, come what may, remain. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
