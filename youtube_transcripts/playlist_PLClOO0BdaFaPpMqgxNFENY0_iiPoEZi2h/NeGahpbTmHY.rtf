In preparing for this message today,\
0:03\
I have felt strong promptings to address\
the young women and young men.\
0:09\
I’m also speaking to those\
who used to be young,\
0:12\
even to those who can’t really\
remember it anymore.\
0:18\
And I speak to all who love our young\
people and want them to succeed in life.\
0:25\
For the rising generation,\
0:27\
I have a message especially for you\
from our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
0:34\
My dear young friends, if the\
Savior were here right now,\
0:40\
what would He say to you?\
0:42\
I believe He would start by expressing\
His deep love for you.\
0:47\
He might say it with words,\
0:50\
but it would also flow so strongly just\
from His presence that it would be\
0:56\
unmistakable, reaching deep into your\
heart, filling your whole soul.\
1:03\
And yet, because we are all\
weak and imperfect,\
1:07\
some concerns might creep\
into your mind.\
1:11\
You might remember mistakes\
you have made,\
1:13\
times you gave in to temptation,\
1:15\
things you wish you hadn’t done—\
or wished you had done better.\
1:22\
The Savior would sense that,\
and I believe\
1:23\
He would assure you with words He has\
spoken in the scriptures: “Fear not.”\
1:31\
“Doubt not.” “Be of good cheer.”\
“Let not your heart be troubled.”\
1:38\
I don’t think He would make\
excuses for your mistakes.\
1:43\
He wouldn’t minimize them. No,\
1:46\
He would ask you to repent—\
to leave your sins behind,\
1:51\
to change, so He can forgive you.\
1:54\
He would remind you that\
2,000 years ago,\
1:57\
He took those sins upon Himself\
so that you could repent.\
2:03\
That is part of the plan of happiness\
gifted to us from our loving\
2:10\
Heavenly Father. Jesus might point out\
that your covenants with Him—made when\
2:17\
you were baptized and renewed each time\
you partake of the sacrament—\
2:25\
give you a special connection with Him.\
2:29\
The kind of connection that\
the scriptures described\
2:31\
as being yoked together so that with\
His help, you can carry any burden.\
2:37\
I believe the Savior Jesus Christ\
would want you to see,\
2:41\
feel, and know that He is your strength;\
2:47\
that with His help, there are no limits\
to what you can accomplish;\
2:53\
that your potential is limitless.\
2:55\
He would want you to see yourself\
the way He sees you,\
3:00\
and that is very different from\
the way the world sees you.\
3:06\
The Savior would declare in no\
uncertain terms that you are\
3:11\
a daughter or a son of the Almighty God.\
3:16\
Your Heavenly Father is the most\
glorious being in the universe,\
3:19\
full of love, joy, purity, holiness,\
light, grace, and truth.\
3:26\
And one day He wants you\
to inherit all He has.\
3:34\
It is the reason why you are\
on the earth—to learn,\
3:38\
grow, and progress and become everything\
your Father in Heaven has created\
3:42\
for you. To make this possible, He sent\
Jesus Christ to be your Savior. It is\
3:51\
the purpose behind His great plan of\
happiness, His Church, His priesthood,\
3:58\
the scriptures—all of it. That is your\
destiny. That is your future.\
4:06\
That is your choice. At the heart of\
God’s plan for your happiness\
4:13\
is your power to choose.\
4:17\
Of course, your Heavenly Father wants\
you to choose eternal joy with Him,\
4:21\
and He will help you to achieve it. But\
He would never force it upon you.\
4:28\
So He allows you to choose light\
or darkness, good or evil,\
4:33\
joy or misery, eternal life\
or spiritual death.\
4:37\
It sounds like an easy choice,\
doesn't it?\
4:41\
But somehow, here on earth, it seems\
more complicated than it ought to be.\
4:49\
The problem is that we don't always\
see things as clearly\
4:53\
as we would like to. The Apostle Paul\
compared it to looking “through\
4:59\
a glass darkly.” There’s\
a lot of confusion in\
5:03\
the world about what is right and wrong.\
5:07\
Truth gets twisted to make evil\
seem good and good seem evil.\
5:15\
But when you earnestly seek the truth—\
eternal, unchanging truth—\
5:22\
your choices become much clearer. Yes,\
5:27\
you still have temptations and trials.\
Bad things will happen.\
5:33\
Puzzling things. Tragic things.\
5:36\
But you can manage when you know\
who you are, why you are here,\
5:44\
and when you trust God. So\
where do you find truth?\
5:51\
It is contained in the gospel\
of Jesus Christ,\
5:55\
and the fullness of that\
gospel is taught in\
5:58\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
6:00\
Jesus Christ said, “I am the way,\
the truth, and the life:\
6:06\
no man cometh onto the Father,\
but by me.”\
6:11\
When you have important choices to make,\
6:14\
Jesus Christ and His restored\
gospel are the best choice.\
6:20\
When you have questions, Jesus Christ\
and His restored gospel are\
6:25\
the best answer. When you feel weak,\
Jesus Christ is your strength.\
6:33\
He gives power to the weary; and\
to those who feel powerless,\
6:38\
He increases strength.\
They who wait upon the Lord\
6:42\
will be renewed by His strength.\
To help you find the way\
6:47\
and to help you make Christ’s doctrine\
the guiding influence in your life,\
6:53\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints has prepared a new resource,\
6:59\
a revised version of\
For the Strength of Youth.\
7:04\
For over 50 years,\
For the Strength of Youth\
7:06\
has been a guide for generations\
of Latter-day Saint youth.\
7:11\
I always keep a copy in my\
pocket, close to my heart,\
7:16\
and I share it with people who are\
curious about our standards.\
7:23\
It has been updated and refreshed to\
better cope with the challenges\
7:28\
and temptations of our day.\
7:31\
The new version of For the Strength of\
Youth is now available today online\
7:38\
in 50 different languages and\
will be a significant help\
7:42\
for making choices in your life.\
7:46\
Please embrace it as your own and\
share it with your friends.\
7:53\
This new version of For the Strength\
of Youth is subtitled “A Guide for\
7:58\
Making Choices.” To be very clear,\
8:02\
the best guide you can possibly have\
for making choices is Jesus Christ.\
8:08\
Jesus Christ is the strength of youth.\
8:11\
So the purpose of For the Strength of\
Youth is to point you to Him.\
8:17\
It teaches you eternal truths\
of His restored gospel—\
8:23\
truths about who you are, who He is,\
8:26\
and what you can accomplish\
with His strength.\
8:31\
It teaches you how to make righteous\
choices based on those eternal truths.\
8:39\
It’s also important to know what For\
the Strength of Youth does not do.\
8:46\
It does not make decisions for you.\
8:50\
It does not give you a “yes” or “no”\
about every choice you might ever face.\
8:57\
For the Strength of Youth focuses on\
the foundation for your choices.\
9:02\
It focuses on values, principles,\
9:06\
and doctrine instead of every\
specific behavior.\
9:12\
The Lord, through His prophets,\
9:13\
has always been guiding\
us in that direction.\
9:16\
President Nelson is pleading with us to\
“increase [our] spiritual capacity to\
9:22\
receive revelation.” He is\
inviting us to “hear Him.”\
9:26\
He’s calling us to follow Him\
in higher and holier ways.\
9:32\
And we’re learning in a similar way\
every week in “Come, Follow Me.”\
9:38\
I suppose the guide could give you\
9:41\
a long list of clothes\
you shouldn’t wear,\
9:44\
words you shouldn’t say, and movies\
you shouldn’t watch.\
9:48\
But would that really be helpful\
in a global Church?\
9:53\
Would such an approach\
truly prepare you for\
9:57\
a lifetime of Christ-like living?\
Joseph Smith said,\
10:03\
“I teach them correct principles\
and they govern themselves.”\
10:08\
And King Benjamin told his people\
in the Book of Mormon,\
10:11\
“I cannot tell you all the things\
whereby ye may commit sin; for\
10:16\
there are diverse ways and means, even\
so many, that I cannot number them.”\
10:23\
And King Benjamin went on to say,\
“But this much I can tell you, ...\
10:29\
watch yourselves, and your thoughts,\
and your words, and your deeds,\
10:35\
and observe the commandments of God, and\
continue in the faith of ... our Lord,\
10:40\
even unto the end of your lives.” Is it\
wrong to have rules? Of course not.\
10:48\
We all need them every day.\
10:50\
But is it wrong to focus only on rules\
instead of focusing on the Savior?\
10:56\
You need to know the “Whys” and\
the “Hows” and then consider\
11:02\
the consequences of your choices. You\
need to put your trust in Jesus Christ.\
11:10\
He will lead you the right way.\
He is your strength.\
11:15\
Now, For the Strength of Youth\
is bold in declaring\
11:19\
the doctrine of Jesus Christ.\
11:20\
It is bold in inviting you to make\
choices based on Christ’s doctrine,\
11:25\
and it is bold in describing the\
blessings of Jesus Christ,\
11:29\
which promises those who follow His way.\
President Russell M. Nelson taught,\
11:37\
“When your greatest desire is to\
let God prevail [in your life], ...\
11:41\
many decisions become easier. Many\
issues become non-issues.\
11:47\
You know how best to groom yourself.\
You know what to watch and read,\
11:54\
where to spend your time, and\
with whom to associate.\
11:59\
You know what\
you want to accomplish.\
12:03\
You know the kind of person\
you ... want to become.”\
12:07\
End of quote. Jesus Christ has very\
high standards for His followers,\
12:14\
and the invitation to earnestly seek\
His will and live by His truth is\
12:21\
the highest standard possible.\
12:23\
Important temporal and spiritual choices\
should not only be based\
12:27\
on personal preferences or what\
is convenient or popular.\
12:34\
The Lord is not saying, “Do whatever you\
want.” He is saying, “Let God prevail.”\
12:40\
He is saying, “Come, follow me.”\
12:42\
He is saying, “Live in a holier, higher,\
more mature way.”\
12:48\
He is saying, “Keep my commandments.”\
Jesus Christ is our perfect example,\
12:54\
and we strive with all the energy\
of our soul to follow Him.\
13:00\
My dear friends, let me repeat.\
13:03\
If the Savior were standing here today,\
13:08\
He would express His endless love for\
you, His complete confidence in you.\
13:13\
He would tell you that you can do this.\
13:17\
You can build a joyful, happy life\
because Jesus Christ is your strength.\
13:23\
You can find confidence, peace, safety,\
13:26\
happiness, and belonging—\
now and eternally—\
13:32\
because you will find all\
of it in Jesus Christ,\
13:36\
in His gospel, and in His Church.\
13:40\
Of this, I bear my solemn witness as an\
apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ,\
13:46\
and leave you my heartfelt blessing, and\
deep gratitude and love for you,\
13:51\
each one of you. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
