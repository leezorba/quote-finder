Thank you, choir for singing\
“Faith in Every Footstep.”\
0:05\
The music and words of that\
song were written in 1996\
0:11\
by Brother Newell Dayley in\
preparation for the celebration of\
0:17\
the 150th anniversary of the arrival\
of the early pioneers to\
0:24\
the Salt Lake Valley in 1847.\
0:29\
Although this song was written in\
preparation for that celebration,\
0:35\
its message applies to the whole world.\
I’ve always loved the chorus:\
0:43\
“With faith in every footstep,\
we follow Christ, the Lord;\
0:48\
And filled with hope through his pure\
love, we sing with one accord.”\
0:56\
Brothers and sisters, I testify that\
1:00\
as we follow Jesus Christ with footsteps\
of faith, there is hope.\
1:07\
There is hope in the Lord Jesus Christ.\
There is hope for all in this life.\
1:14\
There is hope to overcome our mistakes,\
our sorrows, our struggles,\
1:20\
and our trials and our troubles.\
1:23\
There is hope and repentance and being\
forgiven and forgiving others.\
1:31\
I testify that there is hope\
and peace in Christ.\
1:37\
He can carry us today through\
difficult times.\
1:41\
He did it for the early pioneers,\
1:44\
and He will do it now for each one\
of us. This year marks the 175th\
1:53\
anniversary of the arrival\
of the early pioneers to\
1:57\
the Salt Lake Valley, which has caused\
me to reflect on my ancestors,\
2:04\
some of whom walked from Nauvoo\
to the Salt Lake Valley.\
2:10\
I have great-grandparents who walked\
the plains in their youth.\
2:15\
Henry Ballard was 20 years old,\
2:19\
Margaret McNeil was 13,\
and Joseph F. Smith,\
2:24\
who later became the sixth\
President of the Church,\
2:27\
was just 9 when he arrived\
in the Salt Lake Valley.\
2:32\
They faced deprivations of every kind\
along the trail, such as cold winters,\
2:40\
illness, and lack of adequate\
food and clothing.\
2:45\
For instance, when Henry Ballard\
entered the Salt Lake Valley,\
2:49\
he rejoiced in seeing the promised land,\
2:53\
but lived in fear that\
someone might see him,\
2:57\
because his clothing he was wearing was\
3:01\
so worn out that it did not\
completely cover his body.\
3:06\
He hid himself behind bushes all day\
until dark and then went to a house\
3:15\
and begged for clothing so that\
he could continue his journey\
3:20\
and locate his parents. He was thankful\
to God that he had reached his future\
3:27\
home in safety. My great-grandparents\
followed Jesus Christ with footsteps\
3:34\
of faith throughout each of their\
trials. I’m grateful to them\
3:40\
for never giving up. Their footsteps\
of faith have blessed me\
3:46\
and subsequent\
3:49\
generations, just as your footsteps of\
faith today will bless your posterity.\
3:56\
The word “pioneer” is both a noun\
and a verb. As a noun,\
4:03\
it can mean a person who is among\
the first to explore or settle\
4:08\
a new territory. As a verb,\
4:12\
it can mean to open or prepare\
the way for others to follow.\
4:18\
As I think about pioneers who have\
prepared the way for others,\
4:24\
I first think of the Prophet\
Joseph Smith.\
4:29\
Joseph was a pioneer because his\
footsteps of faith led him to\
4:36\
a grove of trees where he knelt\
in prayer and opened the way\
4:42\
for us to have the fulness of\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
4:47\
Joseph’s faith to ask of God on\
that spring morning, 1820,\
4:54\
opened the way for the Restoration\
of the fulness of\
4:58\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
that included prophets\
5:03\
and apostles called to serve\
on earth once again.\
5:09\
I know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.\
5:14\
I know his faith-filled footsteps led\
him to kneel in the presence of God\
5:20\
the Father and His Beloved Son,\
Jesus Christ.\
5:26\
The Prophet Joseph’s footsteps of faith\
enabled him to be the Lord’s instrument\
5:32\
in bringing forth the Book of Mormon,\
5:35\
which is another testament of Jesus\
Christ and His atoning grace.\
5:42\
Through Joseph's faith\
and perseverance in\
5:46\
the face of incredible hardship\
and opposition,\
5:51\
he was able to be an instrument\
in the hands of the Lord\
5:54\
in establishing the Church of Jesus\
Christ once again on the earth.\
6:01\
During the last general conference,\
6:04\
I spoke about how my full-time\
missionary service blessed me.\
6:09\
I was blessed as I taught about Heavenly\
Father’s glorious plan of\
6:14\
salvation, Joseph Smith’s First\
Vision, and his translation of\
6:20\
the Book of Mormon. These\
restored teachings\
6:24\
and doctrine guided my\
footsteps of faith\
6:28\
in teaching those who were willing\
to listen to the message of\
6:32\
the Restoration of the gospel.\
6:35\
Our missionaries today are modern-day\
pioneers because they share\
6:41\
the glorious message with\
people around the world,\
6:45\
thus opening the way for our Heavenly\
Father's children to know Him\
6:51\
and His Son, Jesus Christ.\
6:54\
Accepting the gospel of Jesus Christ\
opens a way for everyone to prepare\
7:00\
for and receive ordinances and the\
blessings of the Church and\
7:06\
the temple. Last general conference,\
7:10\
President Russell M. Nelson\
reaffirmed “that\
7:14\
the Lord has asked every worthy,\
able young man to prepare\
7:19\
for and to serve a mission”\
7:22\
and that “a mission is also a powerful,\
but optional, opportunity” for “young\
7:28\
and able sisters.” Dear\
young men and young women,\
7:34\
your footsteps of faith will\
help you to follow\
7:38\
the Lord’s invitation to serve missions—\
7:42\
to be modern-day pioneers—by opening\
the way for God’s children to find\
7:49\
and stay on the covenant path leading\
back to His glorious presence.\
7:55\
President Nelson has been a pioneer\
in the Church. As an Apostle,\
8:01\
he has traveled to and opened many lands\
for the preaching of the gospel.\
8:06\
Shortly after becoming the prophet\
and President of the Church,\
8:11\
he pled with us to increase our\
spiritual capacity to receive\
8:16\
revelation. He continues to teach us\
to strengthen our testimonies.\
8:22\
In a devotional for young adults,\
he said,\
8:26\
“I plead with you to take charge of your\
testimony. Work for it. Own it.\
8:33\
Care for it. Nurture it so\
that it will grow. . . .\
8:38\
[Then] watch for miracles to happen\
in your life.”\
8:44\
He is teaching us how to become\
more spiritually self-reliant.\
8:50\
He has said that “in coming days, it\
will not be possible to survive\
8:56\
spiritually without the guiding,\
8:59\
directing, comforting, and constant\
influence of the Holy Ghost.”\
9:06\
I testify that President Russell M.\
Nelson is the prophet of God on\
9:14\
the earth today. Our Savior\
9:17\
Jesus Christ is the ultimate pioneer\
in preparing the way.\
9:24\
Indeed, He is the way for the plan\
of salvation to be accomplished\
9:31\
so that we can repent\
and, through faith\
9:34\
in Him, return to our Heavenly Father.\
9:39\
Jesus said, “I am the way,\
the truth, and the life:\
9:45\
no man cometh unto the Father,\
but by me.”\
9:51\
He’s promised to not leave us\
comfortless.\
9:55\
He will come to us in our trials.\
9:59\
He has invited us to “come unto [Him]\
with full purpose of heart,\
10:04\
and [He] shall heal [us].” I testify\
that Jesus Christ is our Savior\
10:13\
and our Redeemer, our Advocate\
with the Father.\
10:18\
Our Heavenly Father has opened the way\
10:21\
for us to return to Him by following\
His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ,\
10:29\
with faith in every footstep.\
10:33\
My great-grandparents and early\
pioneers faced many obstacles\
10:39\
as they came by wagons, handcarts, and\
walking to the Salt Lake Valley.\
10:46\
We too will face challenges in our\
individual journeys through our lives.\
10:53\
We're not pushing handcarts or driving\
covered wagons over steep mountains\
10:59\
and through deep snow drifts.\
11:02\
We're trying, as they did,\
11:05\
to spiritually overcome the temptations\
11:08\
and challenges of our day.\
We have trails to walk.\
11:15\
We have hills—and sometimes\
mountains—to climb.\
11:20\
Although the challenges today\
are different than those in\
11:24\
the early pioneers’, the ones they had\
are no less challenging for us.\
11:28\
It is important\
to follow the prophet\
11:35\
and keep our feet firmly planted on\
the covenant path of faithfulness,\
11:41\
as it was for the early pioneers.\
11:45\
Let us follow Jesus Christ with\
faith in every footstep.\
11:52\
We need to serve the Lord\
11:54\
and serve one another. We need to\
strengthen ourselves spiritually by\
12:01\
keeping and honoring covenants.\
12:05\
We should not lose the sense of urgency\
to keep the commandments.\
12:11\
Satan tries to dull our commitment\
and our love for God and\
12:16\
the Lord Jesus Christ. Please remember\
that if anyone should lose their way,\
12:23\
we will never be lost to our Savior.\
12:28\
With the blessing of repentance,\
we can turn to Him.\
12:33\
He will help us learn, grow,\
12:36\
change as we strive to stay\
on the covenant path.\
12:41\
May we ever follow in the footsteps of\
Jesus Christ and with faith in our\
12:49\
every footstep, focus on Him,\
12:53\
keeping our feet firmly planted\
on the covenant path\
12:58\
is my humble prayer. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
