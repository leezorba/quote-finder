The story is told of a man\
named Jack who had\
0:05\
a beloved bird-hunting dog named Cassie.\
0:08\
Jack was so proud of Cassie and\
often bragged about what\
0:11\
a skilled dog she was. To prove this,\
0:15\
Jack invited some friends to watch\
Cassie perform. After arriving at\
0:19\
the hunting club, Jack let Cassie out\
to run around while he went inside\
0:23\
to check in. When it was time to begin,\
0:27\
Jack was anxious to show off\
Cassie's amazing skills.\
0:32\
However, Cassie was acting strange.\
0:34\
She wouldn’t obey any\
of Jack’s commands\
0:37\
as she usually did so willingly. All she\
wanted to do was remain by his side.\
0:43\
Jack was frustrated and embarrassed\
and angry with Cassie;\
0:47\
soon he suggested they leave.\
0:50\
Cassie wouldn't even jump into\
the back of the truck,\
0:53\
and so Jack impatiently picked her\
up and shoved her in the kennel.\
0:57\
He fumed as those with him made fun of\
his dog's behavior all the way home.\
1:03\
Jack couldn't understand why\
Cassie was misbehaving.\
1:07\
She had been trained well, and her whole\
desire in the past had been to please\
1:12\
and serve him. After arriving home,\
1:15\
Jack began examining Cassie for\
injuries, burrs, or ticks,\
1:20\
as he usually did. As he put\
his hand on her chest,\
1:24\
he felt something wet and found\
his hand covered with blood.\
1:30\
To his shame and horror, he found\
that Cassie had a long,\
1:35\
wide gash right to her chest bone.\
1:38\
He found another on her right\
front leg, also to the bone.\
1:43\
Jack took Cassie into his\
arms and began to cry.\
1:47\
His shame at how he had misjudged and\
treated her was overwhelming.\
1:52\
Cassie had been acting\
uncharacteristically early in the day\
1:56\
because she was hurt. Her behavior\
had been influenced by her pain,\
2:01\
her suffering, and her wounds.\
2:03\
It had nothing to do with a lack of\
desire to obey Jack or a lack of love\
2:09\
for him. I heard this story years\
ago and have never forgotten it.\
2:15\
How many wounded individuals\
do we have among us?\
2:19\
How often do we judge others based\
on their outward appearance\
2:24\
and actions, or lack of action,\
2:27\
when if we fully understood,\
2:29\
we would instead react\
with compassion and\
2:32\
a desire to help instead of adding to\
their burdens with our judgment?\
2:38\
I have been guilty of this\
many times in my life,\
2:42\
but the Lord has patiently taught me\
through personal experiences and as\
2:47\
I have listened to the life experiences\
of many others.\
2:51\
I have come to more fully appreciate\
the example of our dear Savior\
2:56\
as He spent so much of His time\
ministering to others with love.\
3:02\
My youngest daughter's life experience\
has included emotional health\
3:05\
challenges from the time\
she was a little girl.\
3:09\
There have been many times throughout\
her life when she felt like she\
3:13\
couldn't go on. We will\
be forever grateful to\
3:16\
the earthly angels who have been there\
during those times, sitting with her,\
3:21\
listening to her, crying with her, as\
3:24\
well as sharing together unique gifts,\
spiritual understandings,\
3:29\
and a mutual relationship of love.\
3:32\
In such loving circumstances, burdens\
have often been lifted on both sides.\
3:38\
Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, quoting\
1 Corinthians, said,\
3:43\
“Though I speak with the tongues of men\
and of angels, and have not charity, ...\
3:47\
I am become as sounding brass,\
or a tinkling cymbal.\
3:51\
He continued: “Paul’s message to this\
new body of Saints was simple\
3:56\
and direct: Nothing you do makes\
much of a difference\
4:00\
if you do not have charity. You\
can speak with tongues,\
4:04\
have the gift of prophecy, understand\
all mysteries ... possess all knowledge;\
4:09\
even if you have the faith to move\
mountains, without charity\
4:14\
it won’t profit you at all. ‘Charity\
is the pure love of Christ.’\
4:19\
The Savior exemplified that love.”\
In John we read, “By this\
4:26\
shall all men know that\
ye are my disciples,\
4:29\
if ye have love one to another.”\
4:33\
Many talks have been given by our Church\
leaders on charity, unity, love,\
4:38\
kindness, compassion, forgiveness,\
and mercy.\
4:42\
I believe the Savior is inviting us\
to live a higher, holier way—\
4:47\
His way of love, where all can feel\
they truly belong and are needed.\
4:53\
We are commanded to love others,\
not to judge them.\
4:57\
Let’s lay down that heavy burden;\
it isn’t ours to carry.\
5:02\
Instead we can pick up the Savior’s\
yoke of love and compassion.\
5:07\
“Come unto me, all ye that labour\
and are heavy laden,\
5:11\
and I will give you rest. Take my\
yoke upon you, and learn of me. ...\
5:17\
For my yoke is easy, and\
my burden is light.”\
5:22\
The Savior does not condone sin\
5:24\
but offers us His love and extends\
forgiveness when we repent.\
5:29\
To the woman caught\
in adultery, He said,\
5:32\
“Neither do I condemn thee:\
5:34\
go, and sin no more.” Those He\
touched felt His love,\
5:39\
and that love healed\
and transformed them.\
5:42\
His love inspired them to want\
to change their lives.\
5:46\
Living His way brings joy and peace,\
5:49\
and He invited others to that way\
of living with gentleness,\
5:54\
kindness, and love. Elder\
Gary E. Stevenson said:\
5:58\
“When we confront life’s\
wind and rainstorms,\
6:02\
sicknesses and injuries,\
the Lord—our\
6:05\
Shepherd, our Caregiver—will nourish\
us with love and kindness.\
6:10\
He will heal our hearts and restore our\
souls.” As followers of Jesus Christ,\
6:17\
shouldn’t we do likewise?\
6:20\
The Savior asks us to learn of Him and\
do the things we have seen Him do.\
6:25\
He is the embodiment of charity,\
of pure love.\
6:29\
As we incrementally learn to\
do what he asks of us—\
6:33\
not out of duty or even for the\
blessings we might receive,\
6:37\
but purely out of love for Him\
and our Heavenly Father—\
6:41\
His love will flow through\
us and make all that\
6:44\
He asks not only possible\
6:47\
but eventually much easier and lighter\
6:50\
and more joyful than we could ever\
imagine. It will take practice;\
6:55\
it could take years, as it has for me.\
6:59\
But as we even desire to have love\
be our motivating force,\
7:02\
He can take that desire, that seed,\
7:06\
and eventually turn it into\
a beautiful tree full of\
7:09\
the sweetest fruit. We sing in\
one of our beloved hymns,\
7:15\
“Who am I to judge another\
when I walk imperfectly?\
7:19\
In the quiet heart is hidden sorrow\
that the eye can’t see.”\
7:25\
Who among us might have hidden sorrows?\
7:28\
The seemingly rebellious\
child or teenager,\
7:31\
the children of divorce, the\
single mother or father,\
7:36\
those with physical or mental\
health challenges,\
7:39\
those questioning their faith,\
7:42\
those who experience racial\
and cultural prejudice,\
7:45\
those feeling alone, those\
longing to be married,\
7:50\
those with unwanted addictions,\
7:52\
and so many others dealing with a wide\
variety of challenging life experiences,\
7:59\
often even those whose lives appear\
perfect on the surface.\
8:03\
None of us has perfect lives,\
nor perfect families;\
8:07\
I certainly don’t. When we seek to\
empathize with others who also\
8:13\
experience challenges and imperfections,\
8:15\
it can help them feel that they are\
not alone in their struggles.\
8:20\
Everyone needs to feel that they really\
do belong and are needed in\
8:25\
the body of Christ. Satan’s great\
desire is to divide God’s children,\
8:30\
and he has been very successful,\
8:33\
but there is such power in unity.\
8:36\
And how we need to walk arm\
in arm with each other\
8:39\
on this challenging journey\
of mortality!\
8:43\
Our Prophet, President\
Russell M. Nelson,\
8:45\
said: “Any abuse or prejudice toward\
another because of nationality, race,\
8:51\
sexual orientation, gender,\
educational degrees,\
8:56\
culture, or other significant\
identifiers is offensive to our Maker!\
9:02\
Such mistreatment causes us to\
live beneath our stature\
9:06\
as His covenant sons and daughters!”\
9:10\
While President Nelson has invited\
all to enter and stay on\
9:13\
the covenant path that leads back\
to our Father in Heaven,\
9:17\
he also provided the following counsel:\
9:20\
“If friends and family ... step away\
from the Church, continue to love them.\
9:26\
It is not for you to judge another's\
choice any more than you deserve to be\
9:31\
criticized for staying\
faithful.” Friends,\
9:35\
let us remember that each person\
on this earth is a child of God\
9:40\
and He loves each one. Are there people\
in your path who you have felt inclined\
9:47\
to judge? If so, remember that these\
are valuable opportunities\
9:53\
for us to practice loving\
as the Savior loves.\
9:57\
As we follow His example,\
we can be yoked\
10:00\
with Him and help foster a\
feeling of love and belonging in\
10:05\
the hearts of all our Father’s children.\
10:08\
“We love him,\
because he first loved us.”\
10:11\
As we are filled with the Savior’s love,\
10:15\
His yoke truly can be easy and His\
burden can feel light. Of this\
10:21\
I so testify in the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
