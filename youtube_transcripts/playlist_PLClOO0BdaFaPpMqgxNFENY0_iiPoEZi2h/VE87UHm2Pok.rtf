Within the first few months\
of our marriage,\
0:05\
my dear wife expressed her desire to\
study music. Intending to please her,\
0:12\
I decided to orchestrate a big,\
heartfelt surprise to my sweetheart.\
0:17\
I went to a musical instrument store\
and bought her a piano as a gift.\
0:23\
I excitedly put the purchase receipt\
in a box with a beautiful bow\
0:28\
and gave it to her, expecting an\
effusive reaction of gratitude\
0:33\
for her extremely loving\
and attentive husband.\
0:38\
When she opened that little\
box and saw its contents,\
0:43\
she lovingly looked at me and said,\
“Oh my dear, you are wonderful!\
0:49\
But let me ask you a question:\
is this a gift or a debt?”\
0:58\
After counseling together\
about this surprise,\
1:01\
we decided to cancel the purchase.\
1:04\
We were living on a student budget,\
1:06\
as is the case with many\
young newlyweds.\
1:10\
This experience helped me recognize\
the importance of\
1:14\
the principle of full partnership\
in a marital relationship\
1:18\
and how its application could help\
my wife and me to be of one heart\
1:23\
and one mind. The restored gospel\
of Jesus Christ proclaims\
1:29\
the principle of full partnership\
between women and men,\
1:32\
both in mortal life and\
in the eternities.\
1:36\
Although each possesses\
specific attributes\
1:39\
and divinely appointed responsibilities,\
1:42\
women and men fill equally relevant\
1:45\
and essential roles in God's plan\
of happiness for His children.\
1:50\
This was evident from the\
very beginning when\
1:53\
the Lord had declared that “it was not\
good that man should be alone;\
1:59\
wherefore, [He would] make an help\
meet for him.” In the Lord’s plan\
2:05\
a “help meet” was a companion who would\
walk shoulder to shoulder with Adam\
2:10\
in full partnership. In fact,\
2:13\
Eve was a heavenly blessing in Adam’s\
life. Through her divine nature\
2:18\
and spiritual attributes,\
2:20\
she inspired Adam to work in partnership\
with her to achieve God’s\
2:27\
plan of happiness for all mankind.\
2:30\
Let’s consider two fundamental\
principles that strengthen\
2:34\
the partnership between men and women.\
2:37\
The first principle is “We are\
all alike unto God.”\
2:42\
According to gospel doctrine,\
2:45\
the difference between women\
and men does not override\
2:48\
the eternal promises that God has\
for His sons and daughters.\
2:52\
One has no greater possibilities for\
celestial glory than the other in\
2:57\
the eternities. The Savior Himself\
invites all of us, God’s children,\
3:03\
to come to Him to partake\
of His goodness,\
3:07\
“and he denieth none that\
come unto him.”\
3:10\
Therefore, in this context, we are\
considered equal before Him.\
3:16\
When spouses understand and incorporate\
this principle,\
3:21\
they do not position themselves\
as president\
3:25\
or vice president of their family.\
3:28\
There is no superiority\
nor inferiority in\
3:31\
the marriage relationship,\
3:33\
and neither walks ahead of\
or behind the other.\
3:37\
They walk side by side as equals—\
the divine offspring of God.\
3:43\
They become one in thought,\
3:46\
desire, and purpose with our Heavenly\
Father and Jesus Christ,\
3:50\
leading and guiding the family unit\
together. In an equal partnership,\
3:56\
“love is not possession,\
but participation, . . .\
4:00\
part of that co-creation which is\
our human calling.”\
4:05\
“With true participation, husband and\
wife merge into the synergistic oneness\
4:11\
of an ‘everlasting dominion’ that\
‘without compulsory means,’\
4:16\
will flow with spiritual life to them\
and their posterity ‘forever and ever.’”\
4:23\
The second relevant principle\
is the golden rule,\
4:25\
taught by the Savior in the\
Sermon on the Mount.\
4:29\
“And as ye would that men should do to\
you, do ye also to them likewise.”\
4:36\
This principle indicates an attitude\
of mutuality, reciprocity,\
4:42\
unity, and interdependence,\
4:44\
and it is based on the second great\
commandment, “Thou shalt love thy\
4:49\
neighbour as thyself.” It merges with\
other Christian attributes\
4:53\
such as long-suffering, gentleness,\
meekness, and kindness.\
4:59\
To better understand the application\
of this principle,\
5:03\
we can look at the sacred\
5:04\
and eternal bond established by\
God between our first parents,\
5:09\
Adam and Eve. They became one flesh,\
5:12\
creating a dimension of unity that\
allowed them to walk together with\
5:17\
respect, gratitude, and love,\
5:20\
forgetting about themselves and seeking\
each other’s well-being\
5:24\
on their journey to eternity.\
5:26\
Those same characteristics are what we\
strive for in a united marriage today.\
5:33\
Through the temple sealing,\
5:35\
a woman and man enter the holy\
order of matrimony in the new\
5:40\
and everlasting covenant.\
5:42\
By way of this order of the priesthood,\
5:45\
they are given eternal blessings\
5:47\
and divine power to direct their family\
affairs as they live according to\
5:52\
the covenants they have made.\
5:55\
From that point on, they move\
forward interdependently\
5:59\
and in full partnership with the Lord,\
6:02\
especially in regard to each of their\
divinely appointed responsibilities\
6:07\
of nurturing and presiding\
in their family.\
6:11\
Nurturing and presiding\
are interrelated\
6:14\
and overlapping responsibilities,\
6:17\
which means that mothers and fathers\
“are obligated to help one another\
6:22\
as equal partners” and share a balanced\
leadership in their home.\
6:28\
“To nurture means to nourish, teach\
and support” family members,\
6:32\
which is done by helping them\
to “learn gospel truths\
6:36\
and develop faith in Heavenly\
Father and Jesus Christ” in\
6:39\
an environment of love. To preside means\
“to help lead family members back\
6:45\
to dwell in God’s presence. This\
6:48\
is done by serving and teaching with\
gentleness, meekness, and pure love.”\
6:53\
It also includes “leading family members\
in regular prayer, gospel\
6:58\
study, and other aspects of worship.\
7:02\
Parents work in unity,” following\
7:05\
the example of Jesus Christ, “to fulfill\
these [two great] responsibilities.”\
7:11\
It is important to observe that the\
government in the family follows\
7:15\
the patriarchal pattern, differing\
in some respects from\
7:19\
the priesthood leadership in the church.\
7:22\
The patriarchal pattern\
entails that wives\
7:25\
and husbands are accountable\
directly to God for\
7:28\
the fulfillment of their sacred\
responsibilities in the family.\
7:32\
It calls for a full partnership,\
7:35\
a willing compliance with every\
principle of righteousness\
7:39\
and accountability, and provides\
opportunities for development within\
7:45\
an environment of love and mutual\
helpfulness.\
7:50\
These special responsibilities\
do not imply hierarchy\
7:55\
and absolutely exclude any kind of abuse\
or improper use of authority.\
8:02\
The experience of Adam and Eve\
after they left the Garden\
8:05\
of Eden beautifully illustrates the\
concept of interdependence between\
8:10\
a mother and father in nurturing and\
presiding over their family.\
8:15\
As taught in the book of Moses,\
8:17\
they worked together to\
till the earth by\
8:20\
the sweat of their brow in\
order to provide for\
8:24\
the physical well-being of their family.\
They brought children into the world.\
8:28\
They called on the name of the Lord\
together and heard His voice “from\
8:33\
the way toward the Garden of Eden.”\
8:36\
They accepted the commandments\
the Lord gave them\
8:39\
and strove together to obey them.\
8:42\
They then “made [these] things known\
unto their sons and their daughters”\
8:48\
and ceased not to call upon God\
together according to their\
8:53\
needs. My dear brothers and sisters,\
8:57\
nurturing and presiding\
are opportunities,\
9:00\
not exclusive limitations.\
9:03\
One person may have a responsibility\
for something\
9:07\
but may not be the only person doing it.\
9:11\
When loving parents well understand\
these two major responsibilities,\
9:16\
they will strive together\
9:17\
to protect and care for the physical\
9:20\
and emotional well-being\
of their children.\
9:23\
They also help them face the spiritual\
dangers of our day by nurturing them\
9:28\
with the good word of the Lord\
as revealed to His prophets.\
9:34\
Although husband and wife support each\
other in their divinely appointed\
9:38\
responsibilities, “disability,\
9:41\
death, or other circumstances may\
necessitate individual adaptation.”\
9:46\
Sometimes one spouse or\
the other will have\
9:50\
the responsibility of acting in\
both roles simultaneously,\
9:54\
whether temporarily or permanently.\
9:58\
I recently met a sister and a brother\
who each live in this condition.\
10:03\
As single parents, each of them,\
within their family sphere\
10:07\
and in partnership with the Lord,\
10:09\
have decided to devote their\
lives to the spiritual\
10:13\
and temporal care of their children.\
10:15\
They have not lost sight of their temple\
covenants made with the Lord\
10:20\
and His eternal promises\
despite their divorces.\
10:25\
Both have sought the Lord’s\
help in all things\
10:28\
as they continually strive to endure\
their challenges and walk in\
10:33\
the covenant path. They trust that the\
Lord will take care of their needs,\
10:38\
not only in this life but\
throughout eternity.\
10:42\
Both have nurtured their children by\
teaching them with gentleness,\
10:47\
meekness, and pure love, even while\
experiencing difficult circumstances\
10:53\
in life. From what I know,\
10:56\
these two single parents do not blame\
God for their misfortunes.\
11:00\
Instead, they look forward with\
a perfect brightness of hope\
11:06\
and confidence to the blessings\
the Lord has in store for them.\
11:14\
Brothers and sisters, the Savior set\
the perfect example of unity\
11:19\
and harmony of purpose and doctrine\
with our Father in Heaven.\
11:24\
He prayed in behalf of His disciples,\
11:27\
saying, “That they all may be one;\
as thou, Father, art in me,\
11:34\
and I in thee,\
that they also may be one in us: . . .\
11:38\
that they may be one,\
even as we are one.”\
11:44\
I testify to you that as we, women\
and men, work together in a true\
11:51\
and equal partnership, we will enjoy\
the unity taught by the Savior\
11:57\
as we fulfill the divine\
responsibilities in our marriage\
12:01\
relationships. I promise you,\
in the name of Christ,\
12:06\
that hearts will be\
knit together in unity\
12:10\
and love one toward another.\
12:13\
We will find more joy in our\
journey to eternal life,\
12:17\
and our capacity to serve one another—\
12:20\
and with one another—will\
multiply significantly.\
12:26\
I bear witness to these truths in the\
name of the Savior Jesus Christ.\
12:33\
Amen.\
