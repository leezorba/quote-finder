The eternal principle of love\
is manifested by living\
0:05\
the two great commandments:\
0:07\
Love God with all your heart, soul,\
mind, and strength,\
0:11\
and love your neighbor as yourself.\
0:14\
I remember my first winter\
living here in Utah—\
0:17\
snow everywhere. Coming\
from the Sonoran Desert,\
0:22\
the first days I was enjoying it,\
but after a few days,\
0:25\
I realized that I had to get up earlier\
to remove the snow from the driveway.\
0:31\
One morning, in the middle of a\
snowstorm, I was sweating,\
0:36\
shoveling snow, and I saw my neighbor\
opening his garage across the street.\
0:42\
He is older than I am, so I thought, “If\
I can finish soon, I could help him.”\
0:48\
So raising my voice, I asked, “Brother,\
do you need help?”\
0:54\
He smiled and said, “Thank you,\
Elder Montoya.”\
0:57\
Then he pulled a snowblower\
out of his garage\
1:02\
and started the engine. And in\
1:04\
a few minutes he removed all this\
snow in front of his house.\
1:09\
He then crossed the street with his\
machine and asked me, “Elder,\
1:14\
do you need help?” With a smile,\
I said, “Yes, Thank you.”\
1:21\
We are willing to help each other\
because we love each other.\
1:26\
And my brother’s needs become my\
needs, and mine become his.\
1:32\
No matter what language my brother\
speaks or what country he comes from,\
1:37\
we love each other because we are\
brothers, children of the same Father.\
1:44\
When ministering was announced,\
1:45\
President Nelson said, “We\
will implement a new,\
1:49\
holier approach to caring for\
and ministering to others.”\
1:54\
To me, “holier” means more personal,\
deeper, more like the Savior’s way:\
2:01\
“have love one to another,” one by one.\
2:07\
It is not enough to avoid being\
a stumbling block for others;\
2:11\
it is not enough to notice the needy\
on the road and pass by.\
2:16\
Let us take advantage of every\
opportunity to help our neighbor,\
2:21\
even if it is the first and only\
time we meet him in this life.\
2:27\
Why is love for God the first\
great commandment?\
2:31\
I think it’s because of what He means\
to us. We are His children.\
2:37\
He oversees our welfare. We\
are dependent on Him.\
2:42\
And His love protects us.\
His plan includes agency;\
2:48\
therefore, we will likely\
make some mistakes.\
2:51\
He also allows us to be\
tested and tempted.\
2:55\
But whether we are making some mistakes\
or falling into temptation,\
3:01\
the plan provides a Savior so we\
can be redeemed and return to\
3:05\
the presence of God. Adversity in\
our lives can cause doubt about\
3:11\
the fulfillment of the promises\
that have been made to us.\
3:16\
Please trust in our Father.\
3:19\
He always keeps His promises, and we can\
learn what He wants to teach us.\
3:26\
Even doing what is right,\
3:28\
the circumstances in our life\
can change from good to bad,\
3:32\
from happiness to sadness.\
3:35\
God answers our prayers according\
to His infinite mercy, love,\
3:40\
and in His own time. The brook where\
Elijah drank water dried up.\
3:47\
Nephi’s fine steel bow was broken.\
3:51\
A young boy was discriminated against\
and expelled from school.\
3:57\
A long-waited-for child died\
within days of being born.\
4:02\
Circumstances change. When circumstances\
change from good\
4:07\
and positive to bad and negative,\
4:09\
we can still be happy because\
happiness does not depend\
4:14\
on the circumstances, but on our\
attitude towards the circumstances.\
4:21\
President Nelson said, “The joy we\
feel has little to do with\
4:26\
the circumstances of our lives\
and everything to do with\
4:30\
the focus of our lives.” We can sit back\
and wait for circumstances to change\
4:37\
on their own, or we can look for and\
bring about new circumstances.\
4:43\
Elijah walked to Zarephath, where\
a widow gave him food and drink.\
4:49\
Nephi made a wooden bow and\
hunted animals to eat.\
4:54\
The young boy sat listening and\
taking notes by the window,\
4:58\
and today he is an elementary\
school teacher.\
5:02\
The couple has developed a great faith\
in the Savior Jesus Christ\
5:07\
and trust in the plan of salvation.\
5:10\
The love for the long-awaited child\
who died suddenly is greater than\
5:15\
the grief. When I hear the question,\
“Heavenly Father, are you really there?\
5:21\
And do you hear and answer every child’s\
prayer?” I like to answer, “He has been,\
5:27\
He is, and He will always be there\
for you and me.” I am his son;\
5:33\
He is my Father. And I am learning to\
be a good father as He is. My wife\
5:39\
and I always try to be there\
for all our children\
5:43\
at any time, under any condition, and\
by any means. Each child is unique;\
5:49\
their worth to God is great,\
5:51\
and no matter what challenges, sins,\
and weakness they have,\
5:55\
God loves them, and so do we.\
5:58\
When I received this call as\
a General Authority, on\
6:01\
the last day before we traveled\
to Salt Lake,\
6:04\
all my children and family were\
together in our home for\
6:08\
a family home evening where we expressed\
our love and gratitude.\
6:13\
After the lesson, I gave a priesthood\
blessing to each one of my children.\
6:17\
Everyone was in tears.\
After the blessings,\
6:21\
my oldest son expressed words of\
gratitude on behalf of everyone\
6:25\
for the great love that we had given\
them from the day they were born\
6:29\
until then. Bless your children, whether\
they are 5 or 50 years old.\
6:36\
Be with them; be for them.\
6:39\
Although providing is a responsibility\
established by divine design,\
6:44\
we must not forget to share joyful\
time with our children.\
6:49\
Our Heavenly Father’s love for\
each of His children is real;\
6:53\
He is there for each one. I don’t know\
how He does it, but He does.\
6:58\
He and His Firstborn are one in\
doing the work and glory of\
7:02\
the Father—to bring to pass the\
immortality and eternal life of man.\
7:08\
They have sent us the Holy Ghost to\
guide us, to warn us, to comfort us,\
7:13\
if necessary. He instructed His Beloved\
Son to create this beautiful earth.\
7:19\
He instructed Adam and Eve and\
gave unto them their agency.\
7:24\
He has been sending messengers\
for years and years\
7:27\
so that we can receive His love\
and His commandments.\
7:31\
He was in the sacred grove answering\
young Joseph’s sincere question\
7:36\
and calling him by his name, He said,\
“This is my Beloved Son. Hear him!”\
7:43\
I believe that the supreme demonstration\
of God's love\
7:46\
for us happened in Gethsemane, where the\
Son of the living God prayed, “O,\
7:52\
my Father, if it be possible, let this\
cup pass from me; nevertheless,\
7:58\
not as I will, but as thou wilt.”\
8:02\
I have noticed that the small portion\
that I can understand of\
8:06\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ increases\
my love for the Father\
8:10\
and His Son, decreases my desire to\
sin and to be disobedient,\
8:16\
and increases my willingness\
to be better and do better.\
8:21\
Jesus walked with no fear and\
with no doubt to Gethsemane,\
8:25\
trusting in His father, knowing that\
He must tread the wine press alone.\
8:31\
He endured all pain and humiliation.\
8:35\
He was accused, judged, and crucified.\
During His own agony and suffering\
8:41\
on the cross, Jesus focused\
on the needs of his mother\
8:44\
and His beloved disciple.\
He offered His life.\
8:48\
On the third day, He was resurrected.\
The tomb is empty.\
8:53\
He stands on the right\
hand of His Father.\
8:56\
They hope we will\
choose to keep our covenants\
9:01\
and return to Their presence. This\
second estate is not our final estate;\
9:07\
we do not belong to this earthly home.\
9:10\
But rather, we are eternal beings\
living temporary experiences.\
9:17\
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of\
the living God, and He lives.\
9:21\
And because He lives, all of God's\
children will live forever.\
9:26\
And thanks to His atoning sacrifice,\
9:29\
we can live together with them. In\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
