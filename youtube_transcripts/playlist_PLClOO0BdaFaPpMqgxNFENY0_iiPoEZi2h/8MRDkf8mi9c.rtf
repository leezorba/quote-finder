Our Heavenly Father and our Savior,\
Jesus Christ,\
0:05\
have the power to save\
us and transform us.\
0:09\
They can help us become as they are.\
0:13\
A few years ago, one of our\
young grandsons, Aaron,\
0:17\
began having health problems.\
0:20\
He became fatigued, had quite a bit of\
bruising, and did not look healthy.\
0:26\
After medical testing, he was diagnosed\
with severe aplastic anemia,\
0:32\
a disease where his bone marrow stopped\
producing red blood cells,\
0:37\
white blood cells, and platelets.\
0:40\
Without treatment and an eventual cure,\
0:44\
his blood could not clot properly\
or fight off infections.\
0:50\
So even minor falls, injuries,\
0:52\
or illnesses could quickly\
become life-threatening.\
0:57\
For a period of time, he received\
regular platelet\
1:00\
and blood transfusions to\
keep him out of danger.\
1:05\
The doctors explained that the only\
cure for the disease would be\
1:11\
a bone marrow transplant,\
1:13\
and the best chance for success would\
be to have a sibling as the donor.\
1:20\
If one of his siblings\
were an ideal match,\
1:23\
the outcome of the transplant\
could be lifesaving.\
1:27\
His four younger brothers were tested,\
and one, Maxwell, was deemed\
1:32\
a perfect match. Even with\
a perfect donor match,\
1:38\
a bone marrow transplant still poses\
a serious risk of complications.\
1:44\
The process required that Aaron’s own\
cells in his diseased bone marrow be\
1:51\
destroyed by a combination\
of chemotherapy\
1:54\
and radiation before receiving the\
stem cells from his brother\
2:00\
Maxwell's bone marrow. Then,\
2:03\
because of Aaron’s compromised\
immune system,\
2:07\
he needed to be isolated in a hospital\
for several weeks and then at home\
2:12\
for several months with\
special protocols,\
2:15\
restrictions, and medications.\
2:19\
The hoped-for outcome from\
the transplant was\
2:23\
the Aaron’s body would not\
reject the donor cells,\
2:27\
that Maxwell's cells would gradually\
produce the needed red\
2:31\
and white blood cells and platelets\
in Aaron’s body.\
2:36\
A successful donor transplant causes\
a very real physiological change.\
2:43\
Amazingly, a doctor explained that\
if Aaron committed a crime\
2:48\
and left blood at the crime scene, the\
police could arrest his brother\
2:53\
Maxwell. This is because Aaron's blood\
would come from Maxwell's transplanted\
3:01\
cells and have Maxwell's DNA,\
3:05\
and this would be the case\
for the rest of his life.\
3:09\
Aaron being saved by his brother's blood\
has spurred many thoughts about\
3:16\
the atoning blood of Jesus Christ and\
the effect of His Atonement on us.\
3:22\
I would like to focus today on\
3:24\
the permanent life-giving change\
that occurs as we allow\
3:29\
the Lord to work miracles in us.\
3:33\
Aaron did not have the power in himself\
to overcome the disease.\
3:38\
His body could not make the blood cells\
needed to sustain his life.\
3:44\
No matter what he personally did, he\
could not heal his bone marrow.\
3:50\
Just as Aaron could not cure himself,\
3:53\
we cannot save ourselves. No matter\
how capable, educated,\
3:59\
brilliant, or strong we are, we cannot\
cleanse ourselves from our sins,\
4:06\
change our bodies to an immortal\
state, or exalt ourselves.\
4:11\
It is only possible through the Savior\
Jesus Christ and His infinite Atonement.\
4:18\
“There is none other way nor name given\
under heaven whereby man can be saved\
4:25\
in the Kingdom of God.” It is His\
atoning blood that cleanses us\
4:31\
and sanctifies us. Although Aaron could\
not heal himself, in order for\
4:38\
the transplant to work, he needed to be\
willing to do what the doctors asked—\
4:45\
even very difficult, challenging things.\
4:49\
Although we can’t save ourselves, when\
we submit to the Lord’s will\
4:54\
and keep our covenants, the way\
is open for our redemption.\
5:00\
Like the remarkable process of\
5:02\
the very DNA of Aaron’s\
blood cells changing,\
5:07\
we can have our hearts changed,\
5:10\
have His image in our countenances, and\
become new creatures in Christ.\
5:18\
Alma reminded the people\
of Zarahemla of\
5:21\
the previous generation that\
had been converted.\
5:25\
Speaking of his father, Alma explained\
that “according to his faith\
5:31\
there was a mighty change\
wrought in his heart.”\
5:36\
He then asked, “Have ye experienced this\
mighty change in your hearts?”\
5:43\
It wasn't the people who changed\
their own hearts.\
5:47\
The Lord performed the actual change.\
Alma was very clear about this.\
5:53\
He said, “Behold, he changed\
their hearts.”\
5:59\
They “humbled themselves and put their\
trust in the true and living God . . .\
6:04\
[and] were faithful until the\
end . . . and were saved.”\
6:09\
The people were willing to open their\
hearts and exercise faith,\
6:13\
and then the Lord changed their hearts.\
And what a mighty change it was!\
6:20\
Think of the difference in the lives\
of these two men named Alma before\
6:26\
and after their hearts were changed.\
6:30\
We are children of God with\
a majestic destiny.\
6:36\
We can be changed to become like\
Him and have a “fulness of joy.”\
6:42\
Satan, on the other hand, would have\
us be miserable like he is.\
6:47\
We have the ability to choose\
whom we follow.\
6:52\
When we follow Satan, we give him power.\
When we follow God, He gives us power.\
7:01\
The Savior taught that we “should be\
perfect.” This can seem so daunting.\
7:08\
I can clearly see my personal\
inadequacies and am painfully aware of\
7:14\
the distance between me and perfection.\
7:18\
We may have a tendency to think\
we have to perfect ourselves,\
7:23\
but that is not possible.\
7:26\
Following every suggestion in\
every self-help book in\
7:30\
the world will not bring it about.\
7:33\
There is only one way and one name\
whereby perfection comes.\
7:39\
We are “made perfect through Jesus\
7:43\
the mediator of the new covenant, who\
wrought out this perfect atonement\
7:49\
through the shedding of his own blood.”\
7:52\
Our perfection is only possible\
through God's grace.\
7:58\
Can you imagine how overwhelming it\
would have been for our young grandson\
8:04\
Aaron to assume he had to understand\
and perform all\
8:09\
the medical procedures associated\
with his transplant?\
8:15\
We should not assume we need to do\
what only the Savior can do in\
8:21\
the miraculous process\
of our perfection.\
8:25\
As Moroni concluded his record,\
he taught, “Yea,\
8:29\
come unto Christ, and\
be perfected in him, . . .\
8:32\
and if ye shall deny yourselves\
of all ungodliness,\
8:36\
and love God with all your\
might, mind, and strength,\
8:39\
then is His grace sufficient\
for you, that by his grace\
8:44\
ye may be perfect in Christ.” What\
a comforting and powerful truth!\
8:50\
His grace is sufficient for me. His\
grace is sufficient for you.\
8:59\
His grace is sufficient for all\
who “labour and are heavy laden.”\
9:05\
With medical treatments like Aaron’s,\
9:08\
there is always some uncertainty\
of the outcome.\
9:11\
In fact, Aaron needed a\
second transplant when\
9:14\
the first one had complications.\
9:17\
Thankfully, with a spiritual\
change of heart,\
9:20\
we don’t have to wonder if it\
will happen. When we live\
9:24\
according to His will,\
“relying wholly upon\
9:28\
the merits of him\
who is mighty to save,”\
9:31\
there is a 100% guarantee of being\
cleansed by the Savior’s blood\
9:36\
and eventually being perfected in Him.\
9:40\
He is “a God of truth,\
and [can] not lie.”\
9:44\
There is no question that this\
process of change takes time\
9:48\
and will not be completed until after\
this life. But the promise is sure.\
9:54\
When the fulfillment of God's\
promises seem far off,\
9:58\
we still embrace those promises, knowing\
they will be fulfilled.\
10:04\
The miraculous change in Aaron's health\
has brought great joy to our family.\
10:09\
Imagine the great joy in heaven as\
mighty changes happen in our souls.\
10:15\
Our Heavenly Father and our Savior\
Jesus Christ love us\
10:19\
and have graciously offered to change us\
and perfect us. They want to do this.\
10:26\
It is central to Their work and glory.\
10:30\
I testify They have power to do this\
as we come to Them in faith.\
10:36\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
