Years ago, following a graduate\
school discussion\
0:04\
on American religious history,\
0:08\
a fellow student asked me, “Why have\
the Latter-day Saints not adopted\
0:14\
the cross that other Christians use\
as a symbol of their faith?”\
0:20\
Inasmuch as such questions about\
the cross are often really\
0:25\
a question about our commitment\
to Christ,\
0:28\
I immediately told him that\
0:30\
The Church of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints considers\
0:34\
the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ\
to be the central fact,\
0:40\
the crucial foundation,\
the chief doctrine, and\
0:44\
the ultimate expression of divine\
love in God's grand plan for\
0:50\
the salvation of His children.\
0:52\
I explained that the saving grace\
inherent in that act was essential\
0:57\
for and universally gifted to\
the entire human family,\
1:03\
from Adam and Eve to the\
end of the world.\
1:07\
I quoted the Prophet Joseph Smith,\
1:09\
who said, “all ... things which pertain\
to our religion are only appendages” to\
1:17\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
1:19\
Then I read him what Nephi had written\
600 years before Jesus’s birth:\
1:26\
“And ... the angel spake unto me ...\
saying: Look!\
1:30\
And I looked and beheld\
the Lamb of God, ...\
1:34\
“[Who] was lifted up upon the cross\
1:38\
and slain for the sins of the world.”\
1:41\
With my “love, share, and invite” zeal\
now kicking into high gear,\
1:45\
I kept reading! To the Nephites\
in the New World,\
1:49\
the resurrected Christ said,\
1:52\
“My Father sent me that I might\
be lifted up upon the cross; ...\
1:56\
that I might draw all men unto me, ...\
1:59\
“And for this cause, I\
have been lifted up.”\
2:05\
I was about to quote the\
Apostle Paul when\
2:07\
I noticed that my friend's eyes\
were starting to glaze over.\
2:13\
A quick look at his wristwatch\
apparently reminded him that he needed\
2:17\
to be somewhere—anywhere—\
2:21\
and he dashed off to his\
fictitious appointment.\
2:26\
Thus ended our conversation.\
2:29\
Well, this morning, some 50 years later,\
2:33\
I am determined to finish\
that explanation—\
2:39\
even if every single, solitary one of\
you start looking at your wristwatches.\
2:47\
Now, as I attempt to explain why we\
generally do not use the iconography of\
2:53\
the cross, I wish to make abundantly\
clear our deep respect\
2:59\
and profound admiration for the\
faith-filled motives and\
3:04\
the devoted lives of those who do.\
3:08\
One reason we do not emphasize\
the cross as\
3:11\
a symbol stems from our biblical roots.\
3:16\
Because crucifixion was one of\
3:19\
the Roman Empire’s most agonizing\
forms of execution,\
3:23\
many early followers of Jesus chose not\
to highlight that brutal instrument\
3:30\
of suffering. The meaning of Christ's\
death was certainly central to their\
3:36\
faith, but for some 300 years they\
typically sought to convey their gospel\
3:43\
identity through other means.\
3:47\
By the fourth and fifth centuries,\
3:49\
a cross was being introduced as a symbol\
of generalized Christianity,\
3:56\
but ours is not a “generalized\
Christianity.”\
4:00\
Being neither Catholic nor Protestant,\
we are, rather, a restored church—\
4:07\
the restored New Testament Church.\
4:11\
Thus, our origins and our authority go\
back before the time of councils\
4:18\
and creeds and iconography.\
4:21\
In this sense, the absence of\
4:24\
a symbol that was late coming into\
common use is yet another evidence that\
4:30\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints is\
4:34\
a restoration of true Christian\
beginnings.\
4:39\
Another reason for not using iconized\
crosses is the emphasis on\
4:45\
the complete miracle of Christ’s mission\
—His glorious Resurrection\
4:51\
as well as his sacrificial\
suffering and death.\
4:56\
In underscoring that relationship,\
4:59\
I note two pieces of art that serve as\
backdrops for the First Presidency\
5:06\
and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in\
their sacred weekly temple meetings each\
5:12\
Thursday in Salt Lake City.\
5:15\
These portrayals serve as constant\
reminders to us of\
5:21\
the price that was paid and the\
victory that was won by Him\
5:27\
whose servants we are. A more public\
representation of Christ’s two-part\
5:34\
triumph is our use of this small\
Thorvaldsen image of\
5:39\
the resurrected Christ emerging\
in glory from the tomb with\
5:45\
the wounds of His crucifixion\
still evident.\
5:50\
Lastly, we remind ourselves that\
5:53\
President Gordon B. Hinckley\
once taught,\
5:57\
“The lives of our people must\
[be] the ... symbol of our [faith].”\
6:04\
These considerations, especially\
the latter,\
6:08\
bring me to what may be the most\
important of all scriptural references\
6:13\
to the cross. It has nothing to do with\
pendants or jewelry, or with steeples\
6:21\
or signposts. It has to do, rather,\
6:25\
with the rock-ribbed integrity and\
6:28\
the stiff moral backbone that Christians\
should bring to the call\
6:34\
Jesus has given to every one of His\
disciples. In every land and age,\
6:43\
He has said to us all, “If any man\
[or woman] will come after me,\
6:51\
let him deny himself, and take\
up his cross, and follow me.”\
7:00\
This speaks of the crosses we bear\
rather than the ones we wear.\
7:07\
To be a follower of Jesus Christ, one\
must sometimes carry a burden—\
7:13\
your own or someone else’s—\
7:16\
and go where sacrifice is required\
and suffering is inevitable.\
7:25\
A true Christian cannot follow\
7:26\
the Master only in those matters with\
which he or she agrees. No.\
7:33\
We follow Him everywhere,\
including, if necessary,\
7:38\
into arenas filled with\
tears and trouble,\
7:42\
where sometimes we may stand\
very much alone.\
7:48\
I know people, in and out of\
7:50\
the Church, who are following Christ\
just that faithfully.\
7:56\
I know children with severe\
physical disabilities,\
8:02\
and I know the parents\
who care for them.\
8:05\
I see all of them working sometimes\
to the point of total exhaustion,\
8:11\
seeking strength and safety and\
8:14\
a few moments of joy that\
can come no other way.\
8:20\
I know many single adults who yearn for\
and deserve a loving companion,\
8:27\
a wonderful marriage, and a home\
full of children all their own.\
8:32\
No desire could be more righteous,\
8:36\
but year after year such good\
fortune does not yet come.\
8:42\
I know those who are fighting mental\
illness of many kinds, who plead\
8:47\
for help as they pray\
and pine and claw for\
8:53\
the promised land of\
emotional stability.\
8:59\
I know those who live with debilitating\
poverty but, defying despair,\
9:05\
ask only for the chance to make better\
lives for their loved ones and others—\
9:11\
those in need around them.\
9:14\
I know many who wrestle with wrenching\
matters of identity,\
9:20\
gender, and sexuality. I weep for\
them, and I weep with them,\
9:27\
knowing how significant the consequences\
of their decisions\
9:31\
will be. These are just a few of\
9:35\
so many trying circumstances\
we may face in life—\
9:41\
solemn reminders that there\
is a cost to discipleship.\
9:49\
To Araunah, who attempted to give him\
free oxen and free wood\
9:55\
for his burnt offering,\
King David said, “Nay;\
10:01\
but I will surely buy it\
of thee at a price; ...\
10:06\
[for I] will [not] offer ...\
unto the Lord my God ...\
10:10\
that which doth cost me nothing.”\
10:15\
So too say we all.\
10:20\
As we take up our crosses\
and follow Him,\
10:24\
it would be tragic if indeed\
10:26\
the weight of our challenges did\
not make us more empathetic\
10:32\
and more attentive to the burdens\
being carried by others.\
10:39\
It is one of the most powerful\
paradoxes of the Crucifixion\
10:44\
that the arms of the Savior\
were stretched wide open\
10:49\
and then nailed there,\
10:52\
unwittingly but accurately\
10:56\
portraying that every man, woman and\
child in the entire human family\
11:03\
is not only welcome but invited into\
His redeeming, exalting embrace.\
11:13\
As the glorious Resurrection followed\
the agonizing Crucifixion,\
11:20\
so blessings of every kind are poured\
out on those who are willing,\
11:26\
as the Book of Mormon\
prophet Jacob says,\
11:30\
to “believe in Christ, and view his\
death, and suffer his cross.”\
11:38\
Sometimes these blessings come soon.\
Sometimes they come later,\
11:44\
but the marvelous conclusion to\
our personal via dolorosa\
11:51\
is the promise from the Master Himself\
that they do and will come.\
11:58\
To obtain such blessings,\
may we follow Him—\
12:04\
unfailing, never faltering nor fleeing,\
never flinching at the task,\
12:12\
not when our crosses may be heavy\
and not when, for a time,\
12:19\
the path may grow dark.\
12:23\
For your strength and your\
loyalty and your love,\
12:29\
I give deep personal thanks this day.\
I bear apostolic witness\
12:39\
of Him who was lifted up\
12:42\
and to the eternal blessings He bestows,\
even the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\
