My dear brothers and sisters,\
0:04\
I am grateful to be gathered with you\
in this general conference of\
0:10\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
0:15\
We have felt your faith and your\
love wherever you are.\
0:20\
We have been edified by\
the inspired teaching,\
0:25\
the powerful testimonies, and\
the magnificent music.\
0:31\
I encourage you to continue striving to\
qualify to return to Heavenly Father\
0:41\
and Jesus Christ. Wherever you\
are on the covenant path,\
0:48\
you will find a struggle against the\
physical trials of mortality\
0:55\
and the opposition of Satan.\
0:59\
As my mother told me when I complained\
of how hard something was, she said,\
1:07\
“Oh, Hal, of course it’s hard. It’s\
supposed to be. Life is a test.”\
1:14\
She could say that calmly, even with a\
smile, because she knew two things.\
1:22\
Regardless of the struggle,\
1:25\
what would matter most would be to\
arrive at home to be with her\
1:31\
Heavenly Father. And she knew she could\
do it through faith in her Savior.\
1:42\
She felt that He was close to her in the\
days she knew she was about to die.\
1:49\
She talked with me about the Savior\
as she lay in her bedroom.\
1:55\
There was a door to another\
room near her bed.\
2:00\
She smiled and looked at the door when\
she spoke calmly of seeing Him soon.\
2:09\
I still remember looking at the door\
and imagining the room behind it.\
2:16\
She is now in the spirit world.\
2:19\
And she was able to keep her eyes\
on the prize she wanted,\
2:25\
despite years of physical\
and personal trial.\
2:31\
The legacy of encouragement she left\
2:34\
for us is best described\
in Moroni 7,\
2:40\
where Mormon encourages his\
son, Moroni, and his people.\
2:47\
It is a legacy of encouragement\
to a posterity,\
2:53\
as was my mother's to her family.\
2:57\
Mormon passed that legacy of\
encouragement to all who have\
3:04\
determination to qualify through all\
their mortal tests for eternal life.\
3:13\
Mormon begins in the first verses\
of Moroni 7 with\
3:18\
a testimony of Jesus Christ, of angels,\
and of the Spirit of Christ,\
3:26\
which allows us to know good from evil\
and so be able to choose the right.\
3:32\
He puts Jesus Christ first,\
3:36\
as do all who succeed in giving\
encouragement to those struggling\
3:43\
upward on the path to\
their heavenly home.\
3:48\
Open quote, “For no man can be saved,\
according to the words of Christ,\
3:54\
save they shall have faith in his name;\
3:58\
wherefore, if these things have ceased,\
then awful is the state of man,\
4:05\
for they are as though there had\
been no redemption made.\
4:11\
“But behold, my beloved brethren,\
I judge better things of you, for\
4:16\
I judge that ye have faith in Christ\
because of your meekness;\
4:23\
for if you have not faith in him,\
4:26\
then ye are not fit to be numbered\
among the people of his church.”\
4:31\
Close quote. Mormon saw meekness\
as evidence of\
4:37\
the strength of their faith. He saw that\
they felt dependent on the Savior.\
4:47\
He encouraged them by noting that faith.\
Mormon continued giving them\
4:53\
encouragement by helping them\
see that their faith\
4:58\
and meekness would build\
their assurance\
5:02\
and their confidence of success\
in their struggle. Open quote.\
5:08\
“And again, my beloved brethren, I would\
speak unto you concerning hope.\
5:14\
How is it that ye can attain unto\
faith, save ye shall have hope?\
5:20\
And what is it that ye shall hope for?\
5:25\
Behold, I say into you that ye shall\
hope through the atonement of Christ\
5:30\
and the power of his resurrection,\
to be raised unto life eternal,\
5:36\
and this because of your faith in\
him according to the promise.\
5:41\
Wherefore, if a man have faith,\
he must need to have hope;\
5:47\
for without faith, there\
cannot be any hope.\
5:51\
And again, behold I say unto you that\
he cannot have faith and hope, save\
5:56\
he shall be meek and lowly\
of heart.” Close quote.\
6:02\
Mormon then encourages them by\
testifying that they are on\
6:08\
the way to receiving the gift of\
their hearts being filled with\
6:13\
the pure love of Christ. He\
weaves together for them\
6:19\
the interactions of faith in Jesus\
Christ, meekness, humility,\
6:27\
the Holy Ghost, and the firm hope\
of receiving eternal life.\
6:35\
He encourages them this way,\
6:38\
open quote: “For none is acceptable\
before God, save the meek\
6:45\
and lowly in heart; and if a man\
be meek and lowly in heart\
6:51\
and confesses by the power of\
the Holy Ghost that Jesus is\
6:56\
the Christ, he must needs have charity;\
for if he have not charity\
7:03\
he is nothing; wherefore he\
must needs have charity.”\
7:10\
Looking back now, I see how that gift\
of charity, the pure love of Christ,\
7:18\
strengthened, guided, sustained, and\
changed my mother in the struggle\
7:26\
on her way home. Open quote.\
7:30\
“And charity suffereth long, and\
is kind, and envieth not,\
7:36\
and is not puffed up, seeketh not\
her own, is not easily provoked,\
7:43\
thinketh no evil, rejoiceth\
not in iniquity\
7:47\
but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all\
things, believeth all things, hopeth\
7:54\
all things, endureth all things;\
7:59\
wherefore my beloved brethren,\
if ye have not charity,\
8:04\
ye are nothing, for charity\
8:07\
never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto\
charity, which is the greatest of all,\
8:16\
for all things must fail—\
8:18\
but charity is the pure love of Christ\
and it endureth forever;\
8:25\
and whoso is found possessed of it at\
the last day, it shall be well with him.\
8:33\
Wherefore, my beloved brethren,\
pray unto the Father,\
8:37\
with all the energy of heart, that\
ye may be filled with this love,\
8:43\
which he hath bestowed upon all who are\
true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ;\
8:53\
that ye may become the sons of God;\
that when he shall appear,\
9:01\
we shall be like him, for we\
shall see him as he is;\
9:06\
that we may have this hope; that we may\
be purified, even as he is pure.”\
9:15\
I am grateful for the encouragement\
of Mormon’s example and teaching.\
9:23\
I have been blessed as well\
by my mother's legacy.\
9:29\
Prophets from Adam to the present\
day, through teaching\
9:33\
and by example, have strengthened me.\
9:39\
Out of deference to those I know\
personally and their families,\
9:44\
I've chosen not to seek to verify\
the details of their struggles\
9:50\
or to speak of their great\
gifts publicly.\
9:53\
Yet what I have seen has encouraged\
me and changed me for the better.\
10:01\
At the risk of invading her privacy,\
10:05\
I will add a brief report of the\
encouragement of my wife.\
10:10\
I do so carefully. She is a private\
person who neither seeks\
10:16\
nor appreciates praise. In fact, when\
I ever—she cannot speak now,\
10:22\
but when she’s nearby, and I’m praising\
her to somebody who’s there,\
10:27\
she always goes like this. To\
suggest, “Enough. Enough.”\
10:33\
We have been married for 60 years.\
It is because of that experience\
10:43\
that I now understand the meaning of\
these scriptural words: faith, hope,\
10:49\
meekness, enduring, seeking not\
our own, rejoicing in the truth,\
10:58\
not thinking evil, and,\
above all, charity.\
11:04\
On the basis of that experience,\
I can bear testimony that\
11:09\
apparently ordinary human beings can\
take all of those wonderful ideals into\
11:16\
their daily lives as they rise through\
the buffetings of life.\
11:23\
Millions of you listening know such\
people. Many of you are such people.\
11:32\
All of us need such encouraging\
examples and loving friends.\
11:40\
When you sit with someone as their\
ministering sister or brother,\
11:46\
you represent the Lord. Think\
of what He would do or say.\
11:52\
He would invite them to come unto Him.\
He would encourage them.\
11:58\
He would notice and praise\
the beginning of\
12:02\
the changes they will need to make.\
12:06\
And He would be the perfect example\
for them to emulate.\
12:13\
No one can completely do that yet, but\
by listening to this conference,\
12:20\
you can know you are on the way. The\
Savior knows your struggles in detail.\
12:27\
He knows your great potential to grow\
in faith, hope, and charity.\
12:34\
The commandments and covenants\
He offers\
12:38\
you are not tests to control you.\
12:43\
They are a gift to lift you toward\
receiving all the gifts of God\
12:49\
and to returning home to your Heavenly\
Father and the Lord, who love you.\
12:58\
Jesus Christ paid the price of our sins.\
13:04\
We may claim that blessing of eternal\
life if we will have faith in Him\
13:10\
enough to repent and become\
like a child—\
13:14\
pure and ready to receive the greatest\
of all the gifts of God.\
13:22\
I pray that you will accept\
His invitation,\
13:25\
and that you will offer it to others\
of our Heavenly Father’s children.\
13:32\
I pray for our missionaries\
across the world.\
13:36\
May they be inspired to encourage each\
person to want and to believe that\
13:44\
the invitation is from Jesus Christ\
through His servants who have taken His\
13:50\
name upon them. I testify that\
He lives and leads His Church.\
13:58\
I am His witness. President Russell M.\
Nelson is the living prophet of God for\
14:05\
all the earth. I know that is true. In\
the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
14:13\
Amen.\
