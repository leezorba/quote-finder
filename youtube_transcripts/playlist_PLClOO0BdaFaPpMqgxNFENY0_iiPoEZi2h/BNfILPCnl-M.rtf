Sometimes it helps to know what to\
expect. Near the end of His ministry,\
0:07\
Jesus told His Apostles that\
hard times would come.\
0:10\
But He also said, “See that\
ye be not troubled.”\
0:15\
Yes, He would leave them, but He\
would not leave them alone.\
0:19\
He would send His Spirit to help them\
remember, stand fast, and find peace.\
0:26\
The Savior fulfills His promise\
to be with us, His disciples,\
0:30\
but we must continually look to\
Him and help us recognize\
0:34\
and enjoy His presence. Christ’s \
disciples have always encountered hard\
0:39\
times. A dear friend of mine\
sent me an old article from\
0:44\
the “Nebraska Advertiser,” a Midwestern,\
United States, newspaper dated July 9,\
0:50\
1857. It read: “This morning early\
0:55\
a company of Mormons passed through\
on their journey to Salt Lake.\
0:59\
Women (not very delicate to be sure)\
dragging hand carts like beasts,\
1:06\
one [woman] tumbled down\
in this black mud,\
1:09\
which caused a slight halt\
in the procession.\
1:12\
Little children trudged alongside\
in their [strange] foreign dress\
1:17\
looking as determined as their mothers.”\
1:21\
I’ve thought a lot about this\
mud-drenched woman.\
1:24\
Why was she pulling alone?\
Was she a single mother?\
1:29\
What gave her the inner strength,\
the grit,\
1:31\
the perseverance to make such a\
wrenching journey through mud,\
1:36\
pulling all her possessions in a hand\
cart to an unknown desert home,\
1:41\
at times being mocked by observers?\
1:46\
President Joseph F. Smith spoke of\
1:48\
the inner strength of these\
pioneer women, saying,\
1:52\
“Could you turn one of these women\
away from their convictions in\
1:55\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints?\
1:58\
Could you darken their minds as to the\
mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith?\
2:03\
Could you blind them with reference to\
the divine mission of Jesus Christ,\
2:08\
the Son of God? No, never in the\
world could you do it. Why?\
2:14\
Because they knew it. God revealed it\
to them and they understood it,\
2:19\
and no power on earth could turn them\
from what they knew to be that truth.”\
2:26\
Brothers and sisters, to be such men\
and women is the call of our day—\
2:31\
disciples who dig deep to find\
the strength to keep pulling\
2:35\
when called to walk through wilderness,\
disciples with convictions that have\
2:40\
been revealed to us by God,\
2:42\
followers of Jesus who are joyful\
2:45\
and wholehearted in our personal\
journey of discipleship.\
2:50\
As disciples of Jesus Christ,\
2:52\
we believe and can grow in\
three important truths.\
2:57\
First, we can keep our covenants\
even when it's not easy.\
3:03\
When your faith, your family, or\
your future are challenged;\
3:07\
when you wonder why life is so hard\
3:10\
when you’re doing your best\
to live the gospel,\
3:13\
remember that the Lord told\
us to expect troubles.\
3:16\
Troubles are part of the plan and do not\
mean that you've been abandoned.\
3:21\
They are part of what\
it means to be His.\
3:24\
He was, after all, “a man of sorrows\
and acquainted with grief.”\
3:30\
I am learning that Heavenly Father is\
more interested in my growth as\
3:35\
a disciple of Jesus Christ than\
He is with my comfort.\
3:40\
I may not always want it to\
be that way, but it is.\
3:45\
Living in convenience does\
not bring power.\
3:49\
The power we need to withstand the heat\
of our day is the Lord's power,\
3:54\
and His power flows through\
our covenants with Him.\
3:58\
To lean in with our faith when\
facing strong headwinds,\
4:02\
to sincerely strive each day to\
do what we covenanted with\
4:06\
the Savior we would do, even and\
especially when we’re tired,\
4:11\
worried, and wrestling with troubling\
questions and issues,\
4:16\
is to gradually receive His light, His\
strength, His love, His Spirit,\
4:23\
His peace. The point of walking the\
covenant path is to approach\
4:28\
the Savior. He is the point. Not our\
perfect progress. It is not a race,\
4:35\
and we must not compare\
our journey to others.\
4:39\
Even when we stumble, He is there.\
4:43\
Second, we can act in faith. As\
disciples of Jesus Christ,\
4:48\
we understand that faith\
in Him requires action,\
4:52\
especially in hard times.\
4:56\
Many years ago, my parents decided\
to re-carpet the house.\
5:00\
The night before the new carpet arrived,\
5:03\
my mom asked my brothers to remove\
furniture and rip out bedroom carpet\
5:07\
so the new carpet could be installed.\
5:10\
My then seven-year-old sister, Emily,\
was already asleep.\
5:15\
So while she slept, they\
quietly removed all\
5:18\
the furniture from her\
room except the bed.\
5:20\
And then they tore out the carpet.\
5:23\
Well, like older brothers sometimes do,\
they decided to pull a prank.\
5:29\
They removed the rest of her belongings\
from the closet and off the walls,\
5:34\
leaving the room bare. Then they wrote\
a note and tacked it to the wall:\
5:41\
“Dear Emily, we moved.\
5:47\
We’ll write in a few days and tell you\
where we are. Love, your family.”\
5:56\
Well, the next morning, when Emily\
did not come for breakfast,\
6:00\
my brothers went to find her. There\
6:03\
she was, sad and alone, behind\
a closed door.\
6:08\
Emily reflected on this experience \
later: “I was crushed.\
6:13\
But what would have happened if\
I had just opened the door?\
6:17\
What would I have heard? What would\
I have smelled? I would have known\
6:23\
I was not alone. I would have\
known I was really loved.\
6:27\
The thought never even crossed my mind\
to do something about my situation.\
6:33\
I just gave up and stayed\
in my closet crying.\
6:36\
And yet, if I had simply\
opened the door.”\
6:41\
My sister made an assumption\
based on what she saw,\
6:45\
but it wasn't a reflection of the\
way things actually were.\
6:49\
Isn't it interesting that we,\
like Emily,\
6:52\
can become so weighed down in sadness\
or hurt or discouragement or worry\
6:57\
or loneliness or anger or frustration\
that it doesn't even occur to us to\
7:02\
simply do something, to open the door,\
to act with faith in Jesus Christ?\
7:10\
The scriptures are filled with examples\
of men and women, disciples of Christ,\
7:15\
who, when facing the impossible, simply\
acted, who got up in faith and walked.\
7:24\
To lepers who sought\
healing, Christ said,\
7:26\
“Go shew yourselves unto the priests.\
7:29\
And it came to pass that as they went,\
they were cleansed.”\
7:36\
They went to show themselves\
to the priests\
7:38\
as if they had already been healed, and\
in the process of acting, they were.\
7:46\
I also want to say that if\
7:48\
the thought of taking action amid\
your pain feels impossible,\
7:52\
please let your action be to reach out\
for help—to a friend, a family member,\
7:59\
a Church leader, a professional. This\
can be a first step to hope.\
8:06\
Third, we can be wholehearted\
and joyful in our devotion.\
8:13\
When hard times come, I try to remember\
that I chose to follow Christ before\
8:18\
I came to earth and that \
challenges to my faith,\
8:22\
my health, and my endurance are all\
part of the reason I’m here.\
8:27\
And I certainly should never think that\
today's trial calls into question\
8:32\
God’s love for me or let it turn\
my faith in Him into doubt.\
8:38\
Trials do not mean that\
the plan is failing.\
8:41\
They are part of the plan meant\
to help me seek God.\
8:46\
I become more like Him when\
I endure patiently\
8:51\
and, hopefully, like Him when in\
agony I pray more earnestly.\
8:57\
Jesus Christ was the perfect example of\
loving our Father with all His heart—\
9:04\
of doing His will, regardless\
of the cost.\
9:08\
I want to follow His example\
by doing the same.\
9:12\
I’m inspired by the wholehearted,\
9:15\
whole-souled discipleship of the widow\
who threw her two mites into\
9:19\
the temple treasury. She gave her all.\
9:24\
Jesus Christ recognized the abundance\
of her all where others saw only her\
9:30\
lack. The same is true with each of us.\
9:34\
He doesn't see our lack as failure,\
9:37\
but rather as an opportunity to\
exercise faith and to grow.\
9:43\
My fellow disciples of Jesus\
Christ, with all my heart\
9:47\
I choose to stand with the Lord.\
9:50\
I choose to stand with\
His chosen servants,\
9:53\
President Russell M. Nelson and\
his fellow Apostles,\
9:56\
for they speak for Him and are the\
stewards of the ordinances\
10:01\
and covenants that tie me to the Savior.\
10:04\
When I stumble, I will keep getting up,\
10:08\
relying on the grace and enabling\
power of Jesus Christ.\
10:14\
I will stay in my covenant with Him\
10:16\
and work through my questions by\
study of God’s word, by faith,\
10:22\
and with the help of the Holy Ghost,\
whose guidance I trust.\
10:26\
I will seek His Spirit every day by\
doing the small and simple things.\
10:32\
This is my path of discipleship.\
10:35\
And until the day that the everyday\
wounds of mortality are healed,\
10:40\
I will wait upon the Lord and trust Him,\
His timing, His wisdom, His plan.\
10:47\
Arm in arm with you I want to stand\
with Him forever, wholehearted,\
10:52\
knowing that when we love Jesus\
Christ with all our hearts,\
10:56\
He gives us all in return. In the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
