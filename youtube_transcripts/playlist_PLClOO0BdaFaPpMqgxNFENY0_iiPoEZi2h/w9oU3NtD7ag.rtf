The book of Samuel includes a\
lesser-known story of David,\
0:04\
the future king of Israel, and\
a woman named Abigail.\
0:08\
After Samuel's death, David and his\
men went away from King Saul,\
0:12\
who sought his life. They provided\
watchcare for the flocks\
0:15\
and servants of a wealthy man named\
Nabal, who was mean-spirited.\
0:19\
David sent ten of his men to salute\
Nabal and request much-needed food\
0:23\
and supplies. Nabal responded to\
David’s request with insult\
0:28\
and sent his men away empty-handed.\
0:31\
Offended, David prepared his men to go\
up against Nabal and his household,\
0:35\
saying, “He hath requited me evil\
for good.”\
0:39\
A servant told Abigail, Nabal’s wife,\
about her husband’s ill treatment of\
0:43\
David's men. Abigail quickly gathered\
the needed food and supplies\
0:47\
and went to intercede.\
When Abigail met him,\
0:50\
she “fell before David on her face,\
and bowed herself to the ground,\
0:55\
And fell at his feet and said,\
Upon me, my lord, upon me\
0:59\
let this iniquity be. . . .\
Now, therefore,\
1:02\
. . . the Lord hath withholden thee\
from coming to shed blood,\
1:05\
and from avenging thyself\
with thine own hand. . . .\
1:08\
Now this blessing which thine\
handmaid hath brought unto my lord,\
1:11\
let it even be given unto the\
young men. . . .\
1:13\
I pray thee, forgive the trespass\
of thine handmaid. . . .\
1:17\
And David said to Abigail,\
1:19\
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which\
sent thee this day to meet me:\
1:24\
And blessed be thy advice,\
1:25\
and blessed be thou, which has kept me\
this day from coming to shed blood,\
1:30\
and from avenging myself\
with mine own hand. . . .\
1:33\
So David received of her hand that\
she had brought him, and said unto her,\
1:38\
Go up in peace, to thine house; . . .\
1:41\
I have hearkened to thy voice, and\
have accepted thy person.”\
1:45\
They both departed in peace.\
1:48\
In this account, Abigail can\
be seen as a powerful type\
1:51\
or symbol of Jesus Christ.\
1:53\
Through His atoning sacrifice,\
1:55\
He can release us from the sin\
and weight of a warring heart\
1:58\
and provide us with the\
sustenance we need.\
2:00\
Just as Abigail was willing to\
take Nabal’s sin upon herself,\
2:04\
so did the Savior, in an\
incomprehensible way,\
2:07\
take upon Him our sins and the sins of\
those who have hurt or offended us.\
2:13\
In Gethsemane and on the cross,\
He claimed these sins.\
2:16\
He made a way for us to let\
go of a vengeful heart.\
2:20\
That way is through forgiving,\
2:22\
which can be one of the most difficult\
things we ever do and one of\
2:26\
the most divine things we ever\
experience. On the path of forgiveness,\
2:30\
Jesus Christ’s atoning power can flow\
into our lives and begin to heal\
2:34\
the deep crevices of the heart and soul.\
2:38\
President Russell M. Nelson has taught\
that the Savior offers us\
2:41\
the ability to forgive: “Through\
His infinite Atonement,\
2:45\
you can forgive those who have hurt you\
and who may never accept responsibility\
2:49\
for their cruelty to you.\
2:51\
It is usually easy to forgive\
one who sincerely\
2:54\
and humbly seeks your forgiveness.\
2:56\
But the Savior will grant you\
2:57\
the ability to forgive anyone who\
has mistreated you in any way.\
3:02\
Then their hurtful acts can no\
longer canker your soul.”\
3:06\
Abigail’s bringing an abundance of food\
and supplies can teach us that\
3:10\
the Savior offers to those who\
have been hurt and injured\
3:13\
the sustenance help we need to be made\
healed and made whole.\
3:17\
We are not left to deal with the\
consequences of others’ actions\
3:20\
on our own. We too can be made whole and\
given the chance to be saved from\
3:25\
the weight of a warring heart and\
any actions that may follow.\
3:30\
The Lord has said, “I, the Lord will\
forgive whom I will forgive,”\
3:33\
but that “of you, it is required\
to forgive all men.”\
3:38\
The Lord requires us to forgive\
for our own good.\
3:41\
But He does not ask us to do it without\
His help, His love, His understanding.\
3:47\
Through our covenants with the Lord, we\
can each receive strengthening power,\
3:51\
guidance, and the help we need both to\
forgive and to be forgiven.\
3:57\
Please know that forgiving someone does\
not mean that you put yourself in\
4:00\
a position where you continue\
to be hurt.\
4:03\
We can work toward forgiving someone\
and still feel prompted by\
4:05\
the Spirit to stay away from them.\
4:08\
Just as Abigail helped David not to have\
an offensive heart and to receive\
4:12\
the help he needed, so will\
the Savior help you.\
4:15\
He loves you, and He is meeting you on\
your path with healing in His wings.\
4:20\
He desires your peace. I have\
personally witnessed\
4:24\
the miracle of Christ healing my warring\
heart. With permission of my\
4:28\
father, I share that I grew up in a home\
where I didn’t always feel safe\
4:31\
because of emotional and verbal\
mistreatment. In my youth\
4:35\
and young adult years,\
I resented my father\
4:37\
and had anger in my heart from\
that hurt. Over the years\
4:41\
and in my efforts to find peace and\
healing on the path of forgiveness,\
4:45\
I came to realize in a profound way that\
the same Son of God who atoned\
4:49\
for my sins is the same Redeemer who\
will also save those who have deeply\
4:53\
hurt me. I could not truly believe\
the first truth without believing\
4:57\
the second. As my love for\
the Savior has grown,\
5:01\
so has my desire to replace hurt and\
anger with His healing balm.\
5:05\
It has been a process of many years\
requiring courage, vulnerability,\
5:09\
perseverance, and learning to trust in\
the Savior's divine power to save\
5:14\
and heal. I still have work to do, but\
my heart is no longer on a warpath.\
5:20\
I've been given a new heart,\
5:22\
one that has felt the deep\
and abiding love of\
5:24\
a personal Savior who stayed beside me,\
5:27\
who gently and patiently led me to\
a better place, who wept with me,\
5:31\
who knew my sorrow. The Lord has\
sent me compensatory blessings,\
5:36\
just as Abigail brought\
what David needed.\
5:38\
He has sent mentors into my life,\
5:41\
and sweetest and most transformative of\
all has been my relationship with\
5:44\
my Heavenly Father. Through Him, I\
have gratefully known the gentle,\
5:48\
protective, and guiding love of a\
perfect father. Elder Richard G.\
5:54\
Scott said, “You cannot erase what has\
been done, but you can forgive.\
5:59\
Forgiveness heals terrible,\
tragic wounds,\
6:01\
for it allows the love of God to\
purge your heart and mind of\
6:04\
the poison of hate. It cleanses your\
consciousness of the desire\
6:07\
for revenge. It makes place for\
the purifying, healing,\
6:11\
restoring love of the Lord.”\
6:14\
My earthly father has also had\
6:16\
a miraculous change of heart in\
recent years and has turned to\
6:19\
the Lord, something I wouldn’t have\
anticipated in this life—\
6:24\
another testimony to me of the complete\
6:25\
and transformative power\
of Jesus Christ.\
6:28\
I know He is able to heal the sinner\
and those sinned against.\
6:32\
He is the Savior and the Redeemer of\
6:34\
the world, who laid down his life\
that we might live again.\
6:37\
He said, “The Spirit of\
the Lord is upon me,\
6:41\
because He hath anointed me to preach\
the gospel to the poor;\
6:44\
he hath sent me to heal\
the broken hearted,\
6:46\
to preach deliverance to the captives,\
and recovering of the sight to\
6:49\
the blind, to set at liberty them\
that are bruised.” To all\
6:54\
that are brokenhearted, captive,\
bruised,\
6:56\
and perhaps blinded or hurt by sin,\
6:58\
He offers healing, recovery,\
and deliverance.\
7:02\
I testify that that healing and recovery\
He offers is real.\
7:06\
The timing of that healing\
is individual,\
7:09\
and we cannot judge another’s timing.\
It is important to allow ourselves\
7:13\
the necessary time to heal and to be\
kind to ourselves in the process.\
7:19\
The Savior is ever merciful\
and attentive\
7:21\
and stands ready to provide the succor\
we need. On the path of forgiveness\
7:26\
and healing lies a choice not to\
perpetuate unhealthy patterns of\
7:30\
relationships in our families\
or elsewhere.\
7:32\
To all within our influence, we can\
offer kindness for cruelty,\
7:36\
love for hate, gentleness for\
abrasiveness, safety\
7:40\
for distress, and peace for contention.\
7:45\
To give what you have been denied is\
7:46\
a powerful part of divine healing\
possible through faith in Jesus Christ.\
7:51\
To live in such a way that you give,\
7:53\
as Isaiah has said, beauty for\
the ashes of your life is\
7:57\
an act of faith that follows\
a supreme example of\
8:00\
a Savior who suffered all that\
He might succor all.\
8:04\
Joseph of Egypt lived a life with ashes.\
8:06\
He was hated by his brethren, betrayed,\
sold into slavery,\
8:10\
wrongly imprisoned, and forgotten by\
someone who had promised to help.\
8:15\
Yet he trusted in the Lord.\
8:17\
“The Lord was with Joseph” and\
consecrated his trials to his own\
8:20\
blessing and growth and to the saving\
of his family and all Egypt.\
8:25\
When Joseph met his brothers\
as a great leader in Egypt,\
8:27\
his forgiveness and refined perspective\
were manifest in\
8:30\
the gracious words he spoke:\
8:32\
“Now therefore be not grieved,\
8:34\
nor angry with yourselves,\
that you sold me hither:\
8:36\
for God did send me before\
you to preserve life. . . .\
8:39\
So now it was not you that sent\
me hither, but God.”\
8:44\
Through the Savior, Joseph’s life became\
“beauty for ashes.”\
8:49\
Kevin J. Worthen, president of BYU,\
8:51\
has said that God “can make good come\
. . . not just from our successes\
8:55\
but also from our failures and\
8:56\
the failures of others\
that cause us pain.\
8:59\
God is that good and that powerful.”\
9:03\
I testify that the greatest\
example of love\
9:05\
and forgiveness is that of our Savior\
Jesus Christ, who in\
9:08\
bitter agony said, “Father, forgive\
them; for they know not what they do.”\
9:13\
I know that our Father in Heaven\
desires goodness and hope\
9:16\
for each of His children. In\
Jeremiah we read, “For\
9:19\
I know the thoughts that I think toward\
you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace.”\
9:26\
Jesus Christ is your personal Messiah,\
9:29\
your loving Redeemer and Savior, who\
knows the pleadings of your heart.\
9:33\
He desires your healing and happiness.\
He loves you.\
9:37\
He weeps with you in your sorrows\
and rejoices to make you whole.\
9:41\
May we take heart and take His loving\
hand that is ever extended\
9:45\
as we walk the healing path of\
forgiveness is my prayer in\
9:49\
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\
