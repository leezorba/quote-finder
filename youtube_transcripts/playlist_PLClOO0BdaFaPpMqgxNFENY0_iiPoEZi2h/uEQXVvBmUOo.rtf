Friends, dear brothers and sisters,\
do you remember believing,\
0:08\
or wanting to believe, in happily ever\
after? Then life happens. We “grow up.”\
0:17\
Relationships get complicated.\
0:19\
This world is noisy, crowded, pushy,\
with pretense and posturing.\
0:26\
Yet in our “deep heart’s core,”\
0:29\
we believe, or want to\
believe, somewhere,\
0:34\
somehow, happy and forever\
are real and possible.\
0:41\
“Happy and forever” are not the\
imaginary stuff of fairy tales.\
0:46\
True, enduring joy and eternity\
with those we love are\
0:51\
the very essence of God's\
plan of happiness.\
0:55\
His lovingly prepared way can make our\
eternal journey happy and forever.\
1:02\
We have much to celebrate and\
for which to be grateful.\
1:06\
Yet none of us is perfect,\
nor is any family.\
1:10\
Our relationships include love,\
sociality, and personality,\
1:16\
but often also friction, hurt,\
sometimes profound pain.\
1:24\
“As in Adam all die, even so in Christ\
shall all be made alive.”\
1:31\
Alive in Jesus Christ includes\
immortality—\
1:34\
His gift of physical resurrection.\
As we live with faith\
1:40\
and obedience, alive in Christ can\
also include joyfully abundant\
1:45\
eternal life with God and those\
we love. In a remarkable way,\
1:51\
the Lord’s prophet is drawing\
us closer to our Savior,\
1:54\
including through sacred\
temple ordinances\
1:58\
and covenants coming closer\
to us in more places.\
2:02\
We have a profound opportunity\
2:04\
and gift to discover new spiritual\
understanding, love,\
2:09\
repentance, and forgiveness with\
each other, our families,\
2:14\
in time and eternity. By permission,\
2:18\
I share two unusually spiritually direct\
experiences told by friends\
2:24\
about Jesus Christ uniting\
families by healing\
2:29\
even intergenerational conflict.\
“Infinite and eternal,”\
2:35\
“stronger than the cords of death,”\
2:38\
Jesus Christ’s Atonement can help\
bring peace to our past\
2:42\
and hope to our future.\
When they joined\
2:47\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints,\
2:49\
my friend and her husband\
joyfully learned\
2:52\
family relationships need not\
be “until death do you part.”\
2:57\
In the house of the Lord, families\
can be united, eternally—sealed.\
3:04\
But my friend did not want to\
be sealed to her father.\
3:07\
“He was not a nice\
husband to my mother.\
3:12\
He was not a nice dad to his children,”\
she said. “My dad will have to wait.\
3:18\
I do not have any desire\
to do his temple work\
3:22\
and to be sealed with him\
in eternity.” For a year\
3:26\
she fasted, prayed, spoke a lot with\
the Lord about her father.\
3:31\
Finally she was ready. Her father’s\
temple work was completed.\
3:36\
Later, she said, “In my sleep\
3:40\
my dad appeared to me in a dream all\
dressed in white. He had changed.\
3:46\
He said, ’Look at me. I am all clean.\
3:52\
Thank you for doing the work\
for me in the temple.’”\
3:57\
Her father added, “Get up and\
go back to the temple,\
4:00\
your brother is waiting to be baptized.”\
4:03\
My friend says, “My ancestors and those\
that have passed on are eagerly waiting\
4:10\
for their work to be done.\
4:12\
As for me,” she says, “the temple\
is a place of healing,\
4:17\
learning, and acknowledging the\
Atonement of Jesus Christ.”\
4:23\
Second experience:\
4:25\
Another friend researched diligently\
his family history.\
4:29\
He wanted to identify his\
great-grandfather.\
4:32\
Early one morning, my friend said he\
felt the spiritual presence of\
4:37\
a man in his room. The man wanted to\
be found and known in his family.\
4:43\
The man felt remorse for a mistake\
for which he had now repented.\
4:47\
The man helped my friend realize our\
friend had no DNA connection with\
4:53\
the person my friend thought\
was his great-grandfather.\
4:57\
“In other words,” my friend said, “I had\
discovered my great-grandfather\
5:02\
and learned he was not the person our\
family records said was our\
5:06\
great-grandfather.” His family\
relationships clarified, my friend said,\
5:12\
“I feel at peace. I feel free.\
5:16\
It makes all the difference\
to know who my family are.”\
5:20\
My friend muses, “A bent branch\
does not mean a bad tree.\
5:26\
How we come into this world is less\
important than who we are\
5:30\
when we leave it.”\
5:33\
The holy scriptures and sacred\
experiences of personal healing\
5:37\
and peace, including those alive\
in the spirit world,\
5:42\
underscore five doctrinal principles.\
5:45\
First: Central in God’s plan of\
redemption and happiness,\
5:50\
Jesus Christ, through His Atonement,\
promises to unite our spirit and body,\
5:56\
“never again to be divided, that we\
might receive a fulness of joy.”\
6:02\
Second: Atonement—“at-one-ment” in\
Christ—comes as we exercise faith\
6:09\
and bring forth fruits unto repentance.\
As in immortality,\
6:14\
so in mortality. Temple ordinances\
do not of themselves change us\
6:20\
or those in the spirit world.\
6:22\
But these divine ordinances enable\
sanctifying covenants with\
6:26\
the Lord, which can bring harmony\
with Him and each other.\
6:32\
Our joy becomes full as we feel Jesus\
Christ’s grace and forgiveness for us.\
6:39\
And as we offer the miracle of His grace\
and forgiveness to each other,\
6:44\
the mercy we receive and the mercy we\
offer can help make life’s injustices\
6:51\
just. Third: God knows and\
loves us perfectly.\
6:57\
“God is not mocked,” nor can he be\
deceived. With perfect mercy\
7:03\
and justice, He encircles in his arms\
of safety the humble and penitent.\
7:10\
In the Kirtland temple, the Prophet\
Joseph Smith saw in vision his brother\
7:14\
Alvin saved in the celestial kingdom.\
The Prophet Joseph marveled,\
7:19\
since Alvin had died before receiving\
the saving ordinance of baptism.\
7:25\
Comfortingly, the Lord explained why:\
7:28\
the Lord “will judge [us] according\
to [our] works,\
7:31\
according to the desire\
of [our] hearts.”\
7:34\
Our souls bear record of our works\
and desires. Gratefully,\
7:40\
we know the living and\
“the dead who repent\
7:43\
will be redeemed, through obedience to\
the ordinances of the house of God”\
7:48\
and Christ’s Atonement. In\
the spirit world,\
7:52\
even those in sin and transgression\
have opportunity to repent.\
7:57\
In contrast, those who deliberately\
choose wickedness,\
8:02\
who consciously\
procrastinate repentance,\
8:05\
or in any premeditated or knowing\
way break the covenants,\
8:10\
planning for easy repentance,\
will be judged by God and\
8:15\
a “bright recollection\
of all [their] guilt.”\
8:18\
We cannot knowingly sin on Saturday,\
then expect automatic forgiveness by\
8:24\
partaking of the sacrament\
on Sunday. To missionaries\
8:28\
or others who say following\
8:29\
the Spirit means not having to obey\
mission standards or the commandments,\
8:35\
please remember that obeying mission\
standards and the commandments invite\
8:39\
the Spirit. We should none\
of us put off repentance.\
8:44\
The blessings of repentance begin\
as we begin to repent.\
8:50\
Fourth: The Lord gives us divine\
opportunity to become more like Him\
8:56\
as we offer proxy saving temple\
ordinances others need but cannot do\
9:02\
for themselves. We become more complete\
and perfected as we become “saviours ...\
9:07\
on Mount Zion.” As we serve others,\
9:10\
the Holy Spirit of Promise can ratify\
the ordinances and sanctify both giver\
9:17\
and receiver. Both giver\
and receiver can make\
9:22\
and deepen transforming\
covenants, over time\
9:26\
receiving the blessings promised\
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\
9:30\
Finally, fifth: As the Golden Rule\
teaches, a sanctifying symmetry\
9:37\
in repentance and forgiveness invites\
us to offer others that which we\
9:44\
ourselves need and desire.\
9:47\
Sometimes our willingness to forgive\
someone else enables both them\
9:51\
and us to believe we can\
repent and be forgiven.\
9:57\
Sometimes the willingness to repent and\
10:00\
an ability to forgive come\
at different times.\
10:04\
Our Savior is our Mediator with God,\
10:07\
but He also helps bring us to ourselves\
and each other as we come to Him.\
10:16\
Especially when hurt and pain are deep,\
10:20\
repairing our relationships and\
healing our hearts is hard,\
10:25\
perhaps impossible for us on our own.\
10:29\
But heaven can give us strength\
10:31\
and wisdom beyond our own to know when\
to hold on and how to let go.\
10:40\
We're less alone when we realize\
we're not alone.\
10:44\
Our Savior always understands.\
10:47\
With our Savior’s help, we can surrender\
our pride, our hurts,\
10:52\
our sins to God. However we\
may feel as we begin,\
10:58\
we become more whole as we trust Him\
to make our relationships whole.\
11:06\
The Lord, who sees and understands\
perfectly, forgives whom He will;\
11:11\
we (being imperfect) are to forgive all.\
11:16\
As we come to our Savior, we\
focus less on ourselves.\
11:20\
We judge less and forgive more.\
11:23\
Trusting His merits, mercy, and grace\
can free us from contention, anger,\
11:30\
abuse, abandonment, unfairness,\
11:33\
and the physical and mental challenges\
that sometimes come with\
11:37\
a physical body in a mortal world.\
11:41\
Happy and forever do not mean that\
every relationship will be happy\
11:45\
and forever. But a thousand millennial\
years when Satan is bound may give\
11:52\
us needed time and surprising\
ways to love,\
11:57\
understand, and work things out\
as we prepare for eternity.\
12:03\
We find heaven’s sociality\
in each other.\
12:06\
God’s work and glory include bringing to\
pass happy and forever. Eternal life\
12:12\
and exaltation are to know\
God and Jesus Christ,\
12:15\
so, through godly power, where\
They are, we shall be.\
12:20\
Dear brothers and sisters, God,\
12:22\
our Heavenly Father, and\
His Beloved Son live.\
12:25\
They offer peace, joy, and healing to\
every kindred and tongue—to each of us.\
12:32\
The Lord’s prophet is leading the way.\
Latter-day revelation continues.\
12:38\
May we draw closer to our Savior\
in the Holy House of the Lord,\
12:42\
and may He draw us closer\
to God and each other\
12:46\
as we knit our hearts together\
in Christ-given compassion,\
12:50\
truth, and mercy—in time and eternity,\
happy and forever. In Jesus Christ,\
12:57\
it is possible; in Jesus Christ, it is\
true. I so witness, in His holy name,\
13:04\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
