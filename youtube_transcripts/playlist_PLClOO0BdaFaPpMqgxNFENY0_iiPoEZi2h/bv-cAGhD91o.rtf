In the Book of Mormon, we read\
of a vital decision made by\
0:04\
the prophet Alma in a beloved\
verse of scripture.\
0:08\
Prior to reviewing those familiar words,\
0:11\
please consider with me the difficult\
circumstances under which that decision\
0:15\
was made. A faction of people calling\
themselves Zoramites had separated\
0:21\
from the Nephites and gathered in\
the borders of the land near\
0:25\
the Lamanites. The Nephites had\
recently defeated the Lamanites in\
0:29\
an unprecedented battle in which\
tens of thousands were killed,\
0:34\
and it was “greatly feared that the\
Zoramites would enter into\
0:37\
a correspondence with the Lamanites,\
and that it would be\
0:41\
the means of great loss.” Beyond\
the concerns of war,\
0:45\
Alma had learned that the Zoramites,\
0:48\
who “had had the word of God\
preached unto them,”\
0:51\
were turning to idol worship and\
“perverting the ways of the Lord.”\
0:55\
All of this weighed heavily on Alma\
and was “the cause of great sorrow.”\
1:01\
Finding himself in these complex\
and challenging circumstances,\
1:06\
Alma pondered what should be done.\
1:09\
In his decision, we read words that\
were preserved to inspire\
1:13\
and instruct us as we\
navigate the complex\
1:16\
and challenging circumstances\
of our day:\
1:20\
“And now, as the preaching of the word\
had a great tendency to lead\
1:24\
the people to do that which was just—\
yea, it had had more powerful effect\
1:29\
upon the minds of the\
people than the sword,\
1:31\
or anything else which had\
happened unto them—\
1:34\
therefore, Alma thought it was expedient\
that they should try\
1:38\
the virtue of the word of God.” Among\
many possible solutions,\
1:45\
Alma's faith led them to rely\
on the power of the word.\
1:50\
It is no coincidence that some of\
1:52\
the most powerful sermons found anywhere\
in scripture were preached\
1:56\
immediately following that decision.\
1:59\
In chapters 32 and 33 of Alma,\
2:02\
we read his masterful discourse on\
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,\
2:07\
and in chapter 34, we find Amulek’s\
seminal teachings on\
2:12\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
2:15\
Indeed, throughout scripture\
2:17\
we read of miraculous blessings poured\
out upon those who have chosen to try\
2:22\
the virtue of the word of\
God in their lives.\
2:25\
I invite you to ponder three examples\
with me as we turn our focus to\
2:29\
the Book of Mormon, a book that\
President Russell M. Nelson described\
2:34\
as our “Latter-day survival guide.”\
2:38\
First, reminding his people how\
2:40\
the Lord delivered their fathers, Alma\
taught, “Behold, he changed their\
2:47\
hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a\
deep sleep and they awoke unto God.\
2:53\
Behold, they were in the\
midst of darkness;\
2:56\
nevertheless, their souls were\
illuminated by the light of\
3:00\
the everlasting word.” Perhaps you are\
feeling as though you were in\
3:06\
the midst of darkness. Does your\
soul ache for illumination?\
3:12\
If so, please try the virtue\
of the word of God.\
3:17\
Second, reflecting on the Lord’s\
conversion of the Lamanites,\
3:21\
which he witnessed as a missionary,\
Ammon said, “Behold,\
3:26\
how many thousands of our brethren has\
he loosed from the pains of hell;\
3:31\
and they are brought to\
sing redeeming love,\
3:34\
and this because of the power\
of his word which is in us.”\
3:41\
Brothers and sisters, there are so\
many among us who are yearning\
3:46\
for someone we love to be brought to\
sing redeeming love. In all our efforts,\
3:55\
let us remember to try the virtue of\
the word of God, which is in us.\
4:01\
Third, in the book of Helaman\
we read, “Yea,\
4:06\
we see that whosoever will may lay\
hold upon the word of God,\
4:11\
which is quick and powerful,\
4:13\
which shall divide asunder all the\
cunning and the snares and\
4:17\
the wiles of the devil, and lead\
the man [and woman] of Christ in\
4:22\
a strait and narrow course across\
that everlasting gulf of misery ...\
4:26\
and land their souls ... at the right\
hand of God in the kingdom of Heaven.”\
4:33\
Are you seeking to cut through all\
the cunning and the snares and\
4:37\
the wiles of the devil so prevalent\
in the philosophies of our day?\
4:42\
Do you desire to disperse the clouds\
of confusion caused by\
4:46\
an overabundance of information in\
order to focus more singularly on\
4:51\
the covenant path? Please try\
the virtue of the Word of God.\
4:58\
As one who has been changed\
by the power of the word,\
5:02\
I personally testify of this truth\
5:04\
so beautifully taught by our beloved\
prophet, President Russell M. Nelson,\
5:10\
quote: “To me, the power of the Book\
of Mormon is most evident in\
5:16\
the mighty change that comes into the\
lives of those who read it with\
5:19\
a sincere heart, with real intent,\
having faith in Christ.\
5:24\
Many converts forsake much that they\
once held dear in order to abide by\
5:30\
the precepts of that book.\
5:32\
It will be your most effective\
instrument in bringing souls unto Jesus\
5:39\
the Christ.” Close quote. In these\
and other illustrations,\
5:44\
we witness the virtue of the word of\
God in the lives of His children.\
5:49\
We might ask, what is the source\
of that virtue or power?\
5:54\
As we consider this question,\
5:56\
it is essential to remember\
that the phrase “the word,”\
5:59\
as used in scripture, has\
at least two meanings.\
6:03\
Elder David A. Bednar recently\
taught that “one of\
6:06\
the names of Jesus Christ is ‘the Word’”\
and that “the teachings of the Savior,\
6:12\
as recorded in the holy scriptures,\
are also the ‘word.’”\
6:17\
The prophet Nephi illustrated\
6:18\
the relationship between these two\
meanings when he wrote: “Hearken unto\
6:23\
these words and believe in Christ;\
6:26\
and if you believe not in these words,\
believe in Christ.\
6:31\
And if ye shall believe in Christ,\
ye will believe in these words,\
6:36\
for they are the words of Christ,\
and he hath given them onto me.”\
6:42\
Thus we learn that there is virtue\
6:44\
in the words of ancient\
and modern prophets\
6:47\
precisely because their words\
are the Lord’s words.\
6:52\
My dear friends, accepting this eternal\
truth is critical to our spiritual\
6:57\
survival in the latter days when,\
as prophesied,\
7:01\
there is “a famine in the land,\
not a famine of bread,\
7:05\
nor a thirst for water, but of hearing\
the words of the Lord.”\
7:10\
Ultimately, the virtue of the word\
of God is the Lord Jesus Christ.\
7:17\
As we comprehend this more fully,\
7:19\
we can make an eternally significant\
connection between\
7:23\
the role of His prophets and\
the Redeemer Himself.\
7:27\
Our love for Him, our desire\
to draw closer to Him\
7:31\
and to “abide in His love” will motivate\
us to try the virtue of\
7:36\
the word in our lives—both the\
virtue that flows from Him\
7:41\
as our personal Savior and Redeemer and\
7:44\
the virtue that flows from Him through\
the words of the chosen vessels of\
7:49\
the Lord. We will come to\
discern that as helpful\
7:54\
as other sources may be in our\
study of the Savior and\
7:57\
the words of His prophets, they must\
never become a replacement for them.\
8:03\
We must drink deeply and often,\
directly from the source.\
8:10\
I express my love to each of you, my\
brothers and my sisters. In that love,\
8:16\
I plead with you to experience the\
virtue of the word of God—\
8:20\
particularly through the Book of Mormon—\
every day of your life. As you do so,\
8:26\
I repeat this prophetic promise from\
President Russell M. Nelson, quote,\
8:33\
“I promise that as you prayerfully study\
the Book of Mormon every day,\
8:38\
you will make better decisions—\
every day.\
8:42\
I promise that as you ponder\
what you study,\
8:44\
the windows of heaven will open\
8:46\
and you will receive answers to your\
own questions and direction\
8:50\
for your own life. I promise that\
as you daily immerse yourself in\
8:55\
the Book of Mormon, you can be immunized\
against the evils of the day.”\
9:01\
End of quote. I testify that our\
Heavenly Father has given us the word\
9:07\
because He loves us perfectly\
9:09\
and wants each of us to return home\
to live with Him forever.\
9:15\
I testify of “the Word ... made flesh,”\
even Jesus the Christ,\
9:19\
and of His power\
to save and to redeem us.\
9:26\
I know that His virtue flows through\
the words of His prophets,\
9:31\
both past and present. It is\
9:34\
the prayer of my heart that\
we may possess the wisdom\
9:38\
and meekness to hold fast to\
the word of God and stay on\
9:43\
the covenant path that leads to\
exaltation and eternal life.\
9:48\
May we continually experience\
9:52\
the mighty change available to each of\
us through the virtue of the Word.\
9:58\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
