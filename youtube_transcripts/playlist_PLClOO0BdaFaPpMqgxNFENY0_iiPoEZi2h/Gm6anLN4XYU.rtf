My dear brothers and sisters,\
0:04\
This evening I speak to the humble and\
devoted followers of Jesus Christ.\
0:09\
I see the goodness of your lives\
0:11\
and your faith in our Savior here in\
this country and in the nations across\
0:16\
the world, and I love you all the more.\
0:21\
Toward the end of His ministry,\
0:23\
Jesus’s disciples asked Him to tell them\
of “the sign of [His second] coming\
0:28\
and of the end of the world.”\
0:31\
Jesus told them of the conditions\
that would precede His return\
0:35\
and concluded by declaring, “When\
ye shall see all these things,\
0:41\
[you will] know that [the time] is \
near.” In the last general conference,\
0:47\
I listened very closely to the words\
of President Henry B. Eying.\
0:53\
“Each of us,” he said, “wherever we are,\
0:56\
knows that we live in increasingly\
perilous times. ...\
1:01\
Anyone with eyes to see the signs\
of the times and ears\
1:06\
to hear the words of the prophets\
knows that is true.”\
1:11\
The Savior commended His\
valiant disciples:\
1:15\
“Blessed are your eyes, for they see;\
and blessed are your ears,\
1:20\
for they hear.” May this\
blessing be ours\
1:24\
as we listen closely to the words\
of the Lord through His prophets\
1:28\
and others in this conference.\
1:32\
The Lord explained that in this final\
time prior to His return, the “wheat,”\
1:38\
who he described as “the children\
of the kingdom,”\
1:41\
would grow side by side \
with the “tares,”\
1:44\
or those who do not love God and\
do not keep His commandments.\
1:49\
They would “both grow together”\
side by side.\
1:54\
This will be our world until\
the Savior returns,\
1:57\
with much that is good and much\
that is evil on every side.\
2:03\
You may at times not feel like a strong,\
mature strand of wheat.\
2:09\
Be patient with yourself.\
2:11\
The Lord said that the wheat would\
include tender blades springing up.\
2:17\
We are all his Latter-day Saints and\
although not yet all we want to be,\
2:23\
we are serious in our desire\
to be His true disciples.\
2:28\
We realize that as evil increases\
in the world,\
2:32\
our spiritual survival and\
2:34\
the spiritual survival of those we love\
will require that we more fully nurture,\
2:41\
fortify, and strengthen the roots\
of our faith in Jesus Christ.\
2:46\
The Apostle Paul counseled\
us to be rooted,\
2:49\
grounded, and settled in our\
love for the Savior\
2:53\
and our determination to follow Him.\
2:56\
Today, and the days ahead,\
require more focused\
3:00\
and concentrated effort guarding against\
diversions and carelessness.\
3:07\
But even with the increasing worldly\
influences around us,\
3:11\
we need not fear. The Lord will never\
desert His covenant people.\
3:17\
There is a compensatory power of\
spiritual gifts and divine direction\
3:22\
for the righteous. This added blessing\
of spiritual power, however,\
3:28\
does not settle upon us\
just because we are\
3:30\
a part of this generation.\
3:32\
It comes as we strengthen our faith in\
3:35\
the Lord Jesus Christ and keep His\
commandments, as we come to know Him\
3:40\
and love Him. “This is life eternal,”\
Jesus prayed, “that they might know\
3:47\
thee the only true God, and Jesus\
Christ, whom thou has sent.”\
3:54\
As we know very well, having faith in\
Jesus Christ and being\
4:00\
a true disciple is more than a one-time\
decision, more than a one-time event.\
4:05\
It is a sacred, ongoing process\
that grows and expands through\
4:11\
the seasons of our lives, continuing\
until we kneel at His feet.\
4:17\
With the wheat growing amidst\
the tares in the world,\
4:22\
how can we deepen and strengthen\
our commitment to the Savior in\
4:26\
the days ahead? \
Here are three thoughts.\
4:31\
First, we can immerse ourselves more\
completely into Jesus’s life, His\
4:37\
teachings, His majesty, His power,\
and His atoning sacrifice.\
4:42\
The Savior said, “Look unto me in every\
thought.” The Apostle John reminds us,\
4:48\
“We love him, \
because he first loved us.”\
4:53\
As we better experience His love,\
4:56\
we love Him even more and,\
very naturally, better\
5:01\
follow His example of loving and\
caring for those around us.\
5:07\
With every righteous movement toward \
Him, we see Him more clearly.\
5:13\
We adore Him, and we try in our small\
ways to emulate Him. Next,\
5:21\
as we better know and love\
5:23\
the Savior, we desire even more to\
promise Him our allegiance and trust.\
5:30\
We make covenants with Him.\
5:32\
We begin with our promises of baptism,\
5:36\
and we confirm these promises and\
others as we repent daily,\
5:40\
ask for forgiveness, and eagerly\
anticipate receiving\
5:44\
the sacrament each week. We pledge\
to always remember Him\
5:49\
and keep His commandments.\
5:52\
When we are ready, we embrace the\
ordinances and covenants of\
5:55\
the temple. Feeling the influence\
of eternity in our sacred,\
6:01\
quiet moments in the house of the Lord,\
6:04\
we gladly make covenants with God and\
strengthen our resolve to keep them.\
6:11\
Making and keeping covenants\
allows the love of\
6:14\
the Savior to sink more\
deeply into our heart.\
6:17\
In this month’s “Liahona,” President\
Russell M. Nelson said, “[Our] covenants\
6:24\
will lead us closer \
and closer to Him. ...\
6:28\
God will not abandon His relationship\
with those who have forged such\
6:33\
a bond with Him.” And as President \
Nelson said so beautifully this morning,\
6:39\
“With the dedication of each new temple,\
6:43\
additional godly power comes into\
the world to strengthen us\
6:48\
and counteracts the intensifying\
efforts of the adversary.”\
6:55\
Can you see why the Lord would\
direct His prophet to bring\
6:59\
the holy temples closer to us\
7:02\
and allow us to be in His\
house more often?\
7:07\
As we enter the temple, we\
are freed for a time from\
7:12\
the worldly influences crowding against\
us as we learn of our purpose in life\
7:18\
and the eternal gifts offered us through\
our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
7:24\
Finally, my third thought.\
In this sacred quest,\
7:30\
we treasure, protect, defend,\
and safeguard the gift of\
7:34\
the Holy Ghost. Both President\
Ballard earlier\
7:39\
and Elder Pearson just moments ago spoke\
of President Nelson’s prophetic\
7:44\
warning that I will repeat again: “It\
will not be possible to survive\
7:50\
spiritually without the guiding,\
directing,\
7:54\
comforting, and constant influence\
of the Holy Ghost.”\
8:00\
It's a gift beyond price.\
8:04\
We do our very best to protect\
our daily experiences\
8:08\
so the influence of the Holy\
Ghost remains with us.\
8:13\
We are a light to the world,\
and when necessary,\
8:17\
we willingly choose to be different\
from others. President Dallin H. Oaks\
8:23\
recently asked young adults,\
“Do you dare to be different? ...\
8:29\
[Especially] important are the choices\
you are making in your personal life....\
8:34\
Are you going forward against\
the world’s opposition?”\
8:41\
In a recent social media post,\
8:43\
I asked fellow disciples to share \
choices they had made that required them\
8:49\
to be different from the world. I \
received hundreds of responses.\
8:54\
Here are just a few. Amanda: “I am a\
nurse working in the local jail.\
9:02\
I try caring for inmates as\
Christ would.”\
9:09\
Rachel: “I am an opera singer and it’s\
often taken for granted that\
9:13\
I will wear whatever costume I'm given,\
regardless of modesty.\
9:18\
Because I am endowed, I told\
the producers that\
9:22\
the costume would need to be modest.\
9:24\
They were unhappy, but reluctantly\
made the alterations.\
9:28\
I wouldn’t trade the peace that\
comes from standing as\
9:33\
a witness of Christ at all times.” \
Chriss: “I’m an alcoholic (in recovery),\
9:41\
temple-worthy member of the Church.\
9:44\
I'm not quiet about my experiences\
with addiction and gaining\
9:47\
a testimony of the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ.”\
9:54\
Lauren: “I was writing a skit with my\
classmates in high school.\
9:58\
They wanted to have my quiet,\
10:00\
reserved character have a sudden\
outburst of profanity.\
10:04\
They kept pressuring me, but I refused\
and held my ground.”\
10:13\
Adam: “A lot of people do not believe me\
when I say I keep the law of chastity\
10:17\
and choose to abstain from pornography.\
They don’t understand\
10:23\
the advantage of joy and peace\
of mind it gives me.”\
10:30\
Ella: “My father is a member of\
the LGBTQ community.\
10:35\
I always try to keep other people's\
feelings in consideration while\
10:40\
standing as a witness of Christ and\
being true to what I believe.”\
10:45\
Andrade: “I decided to continue to go\
to church when my family decided not\
10:52\
to go anymore.” \
And finally from Sherry:\
10:57\
“We were attending an event at\
the governor’s mansion.\
11:01\
They began handing out champagne\
for a toast.\
11:05\
I insisted on water, although the staff\
said it would be offensive.\
11:10\
We toasted the governor and I\
held my water glass high.\
11:15\
The governor was not offended.”\
11:19\
President Nelson said, “Yes, you\
are living in the world,\
11:26\
but you have very different standards\
from the world to help you avoid\
11:31\
the stain of the world.”\
11:35\
Anastasia, a young mother in Ukraine,\
11:38\
was in the hospital having just\
given birth to a baby boy as\
11:42\
the bombings began in Kiev\
this past February.\
11:46\
A nurse opened the hospital room door\
and said with an urgent voice,\
11:51\
“Take your baby, wrap him in a blanket,\
and go into the hall now!”\
11:57\
Later, Anastasia commented,\
12:01\
“I never imagined my first days of\
motherhood would be so difficult,\
12:06\
but I am focusing on the blessings\
and miracles I have seen.\
12:10\
Right now it might seem impossible to\
ever forgive those who have caused\
12:15\
so much destruction and harm.\
12:18\
But as a disciple of Christ, I have\
faith that I will be able to forgive.\
12:24\
I don't know all that will\
happen in the future,\
12:27\
but I know that keeping our covenants\
will allow the Spirit to be with us,\
12:32\
continually allowing us to feel joy and\
hope even during difficult times.”\
12:41\
My brothers and sisters, I have been\
blessed to abundantly receive\
12:49\
the love of our beloved Savior,\
Jesus Christ.\
12:56\
I know He lives and guides\
this holy work.\
13:01\
I do not fully have the words\
to express my love for Him.\
13:09\
We are all children of the covenant\
stretching across the earth in nations\
13:14\
and cultures on every continent,\
13:17\
numbering in the millions, as we await\
the glorious return of our Lord\
13:22\
and Savior. Shining as a light\
to those around us,\
13:27\
we consciously shape our desires,\
thoughts, choices, and actions.\
13:34\
Seeking with all our heart to\
know and love the Savior,\
13:38\
we separate ourselves from\
13:40\
the world through covenants with\
God, being distinct, uncommon,\
13:47\
and special as we honor Him\
13:50\
and His teachings without isolating\
ourselves from others who believe\
13:54\
differently. It is a wondrous journey\
to be wheat among the tares.\
14:00\
Sometimes fraught with heartache,\
14:04\
but always calmed by the maturing and\
assuring settling of our faith.\
14:10\
As you allow your love for\
the Savior and His love\
14:14\
for you to sink deep into your heart,\
I promise you added confidence,\
14:21\
peace, and joy in meeting the\
challenges of your life.\
14:26\
And the Savior promises us,\
14:30\
“I [will] gather together my people\
according to the parable of the wheat\
14:33\
and the tares, that the wheat\
may be secured in\
14:37\
the garners to possess eternal life, and\
be crowned with celestial glory.”\
14:45\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
