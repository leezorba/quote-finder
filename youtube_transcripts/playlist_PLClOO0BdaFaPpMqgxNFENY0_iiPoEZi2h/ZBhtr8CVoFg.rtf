This morning our two children\
0:04\
and three grandchildren in North America\
and about half of the world\
0:09\
saw the brightness of the sun rising\
majestically in the east.\
0:16\
The other three children and seven\
grandchildren in Africa\
0:20\
and the other half of the world saw\
darkness gradually creep upon them\
0:25\
as the sun sank over the\
horizon in the west.\
0:30\
This timeless constancy\
of the onset of day\
0:33\
and night is one daily reminder of\
realities that govern our lives that we\
0:39\
cannot change. When we respect\
0:43\
and align what we do with\
these eternal realities,\
0:46\
we experience internal\
peace and harmony.\
0:51\
When we don’t, we are unsettled, and\
things do not work as we expect.\
0:59\
Day and night is one example of patterns\
that God has given to everyone\
1:04\
who has ever lived on the earth,\
of things as they really are.\
1:10\
It is an absolute truth of our human\
existence that we cannot negotiate\
1:16\
around according to our own desires\
and get away with it.\
1:21\
I am reminded of this every time I take\
1:24\
a flight from Africa to come\
to general conference,\
1:28\
resetting the body clock backwards\
by 10 hours in one day.\
1:34\
Whenever we care to notice,\
1:36\
we see that Heavenly Father has given\
us sufficient witnesses of truth to\
1:43\
govern our lives so we will know Him\
and have the blessings of peace\
1:47\
and joy. Through the Prophet\
Joseph Smith,\
1:51\
The Spirit of the Lord affirms,\
1:54\
“And again, I will give unto you\
1:57\
a pattern in all things, that ye may\
not be deceived; for Satan\
2:03\
is abroad in the land, and he goeth\
forth deceiving the nations.”\
2:09\
Korihor the anti-Christ\
fell for such deception,\
2:13\
disbelieving the existence of God\
and the coming of Christ.\
2:18\
To him, the prophet Alma testified,\
“All things denote there is a God;\
2:24\
yea, even the earth, and all things that\
are upon the face of it, yea,\
2:30\
and its motion, yea, and also all\
2:33\
the planets which move in\
their regular form\
2:36\
do witness that there is a Supreme\
Creator.”\
2:41\
When Korihor insisted to be given\
2:43\
a sign before he could believe, Alma\
caused him to be struck dumb.\
2:49\
Humbled by his affliction,\
2:51\
Korihor freely confessed to having\
been deceived by the devil.\
2:57\
We do not need to be deceived.\
3:00\
The miracle of intelligent life\
constantly plays before us.\
3:04\
And our brief gaze and reflection\
upon the wonders of the heavens\
3:09\
arrayed with numberless\
stars and galaxies\
3:12\
prompts the soul of the believing\
heart to proclaim, “My God,\
3:17\
how great thou art!” Yes, God,\
3:22\
our Heavenly Father, lives, and He\
manifests Himself to us all\
3:26\
the time in multiple ways.\
3:30\
But to acknowledge, believe,\
and continue in God,\
3:35\
our hearts need to be receptive\
to the spirit of truth.\
3:41\
Alma taught that faith is\
preceded by humility.\
3:46\
Mormon added that it is impossible\
for anyone who is not “meek\
3:50\
and lowly in heart” to have faith\
and hope and to receive\
3:54\
the Spirit of God. King Benjamin\
declared that anyone who prioritizes\
4:00\
the glory of the world\
is “an enemy to God.”\
4:05\
By submitting to baptism to\
fulfill all righteousness\
4:09\
even though He was righteous\
and holy, Jesus Christ\
4:13\
demonstrated that humility\
before God is\
4:16\
a foundational attribute\
of His disciples.\
4:21\
All new disciples are required to\
demonstrate humility before God through\
4:25\
the ordinance of baptism, thus:\
4:29\
“All those who humble\
themselves before God,\
4:31\
and desire to be baptized, and come\
forth with broken hearts\
4:36\
and contrite spirits ... shall be\
received by baptism into his Church.”\
4:43\
Humility inclines the heart of the\
disciple towards repentance\
4:48\
and obedience. The Spirit of God is then\
able to bring truth to that heart,\
4:55\
and it will find entry. It is lack of\
humility that contributes most to\
5:01\
the fulfillment of the Apostle Paul’s\
prophecy in these last days:\
5:06\
“For men shall be lovers of their\
own selves, covetous, boasters,\
5:13\
proud, blasphemers, disobedient\
to parents, unthankful,\
5:18\
unholy, “without natural affection,\
5:21\
trucebreakers, false accusers,\
incontinent, fierce, despisers of those\
5:28\
that are good.”\
5:31\
The invitation of the Savior\
to learn of Him is\
5:34\
an invitation to turn away from\
the enticings of worldliness\
5:40\
and to become as He is—meek and\
lowly of heart, humble.\
5:48\
We are then able to take up His yoke\
and discover that it is easy,\
5:54\
that discipleship is not\
a burden but a joy,\
5:58\
as President Nelson has so eloquently\
and repeatedly taught us.\
6:05\
Learning about Christ and His ways\
leads us to know and to love Him.\
6:11\
He showed by example that with\
an attitude of humility,\
6:15\
it is indeed possible to know and to\
love God the Father with all our being\
6:22\
and to love others as we love ourselves,\
holding back nothing.\
6:29\
His ministry on the earth,\
6:31\
during which He put both His will\
and His body on the altar,\
6:35\
was a pattern for the application\
of these principles\
6:39\
on which His gospel is founded.\
6:42\
Both principles are outward-looking and\
are about how we relate to others,\
6:48\
not about seeking personal\
gratification or glory.\
6:53\
The miraculous irony of it is that\
when we focus our best efforts\
6:58\
on loving God and others,\
7:01\
we are enabled to discover our\
own true divine worth\
7:07\
as sons and daughters of God,\
with a complete peace\
7:11\
and joy that this experience brings.\
7:15\
We become one with God and with one\
another through love and service.\
7:21\
Then we can receive the witness of\
the Holy Ghost of that pure love,\
7:26\
the fruit which Lehi speaks about\
as “most sweet, above all that\
7:32\
I ever before tasted.” The crown\
that Christ received by giving\
7:38\
and doing all in His ability to set\
the pattern of loving the Father\
7:43\
and loving us was to receive all power,\
even all that the Father has,\
7:49\
which is exaltation.\
7:52\
Our opportunity\
to nurture in our souls\
7:55\
a lasting love of God and of our\
neighbor starts at home with\
8:00\
the holy habits of connecting with\
the Father daily in personal\
8:04\
and family prayer in the name\
of His Only Begotten Son,\
8:09\
learning together of Them through\
individual and family scripture study,\
8:14\
observing the Sabbath day together,\
and individually holding\
8:19\
a current temple recommend, and using it\
together as often as we are able.\
8:26\
As we each individually grow in our\
knowledge and love of the Father\
8:31\
and the Son, we grow in appreciation\
and love one for another.\
8:37\
Our ability to love and serve others\
outside the home is greatly enhanced.\
8:44\
What we do at home is the true crucible\
of enduring and joyful discipleship.\
8:52\
The sweetest blessings of the gospel—\
of the restored gospel—that my wife,\
8:56\
Gladys, and I have enjoyed in our\
household have come from learning to\
9:02\
know and to honor God at home and to\
share His love with our posterity.\
9:10\
Love for God and service to one another\
9:13\
nurtured at home and service to others\
outside the home in time grows into\
9:18\
the attribute of charity.\
9:21\
This resonates with a pattern\
of consecrated service in\
9:25\
the kingdom of God that is set before\
us by the Lord’s living prophets\
9:30\
and apostles. We become one with them.\
9:35\
We are then enabled to look,\
through them, unto the Lord\
9:39\
“in every thought”\
9:41\
so that we shall “doubt\
not” nor “fear not.”\
9:46\
Like the Lord's living,\
prophets and apostles,\
9:48\
we can go forth with “bowels ... full of\
charity towards all men, and ...\
9:53\
to the household of faith,\
... [with] virtue\
9:56\
[garnishing our]\
thoughts unceasingly; ...\
9:59\
[and our] confidence [waxing] strong in\
the presence of God; and the doctrine of\
10:04\
the priesthood ... [distilling] upon\
[our souls] as the dews from heaven.”\
10:10\
With the Lord’s living prophets\
and apostles,\
10:13\
we too can join a virtuous circle of\
faith strengthened by consecrated\
10:19\
service in which “the Holy Ghost\
[is our] constant companion, ...\
10:25\
[our] scepter [is] an unchanging scepter\
of righteousness and truth;\
10:30\
and [our] dominion [is] an\
everlasting dominion,\
10:34\
and without compulsory means it ...\
[flows] onto [us] forever and ever.”\
10:41\
For this is the promise of the Father’s\
plan. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
