Brothers and sisters, how humbled I am\
to stand before you this morning.\
0:07\
I knit my heart with yours in\
gratitude to be assembled,\
0:12\
wherever you are across the world, to\
hear messages from prophets, apostles,\
0:17\
seers, revelators, and leaders\
in God’s kingdom.\
0:22\
We figuratively become like the\
people of King Benjamin’s day,\
0:25\
pitching our tents and having our doors\
open and directed towards God's prophet\
0:29\
on the earth, President\
Russell M. Nelson.\
0:33\
I've had poor eyesight for as\
long as I can remember,\
0:36\
and I've always needed the aid of\
prescription lenses to correct my\
0:39\
vision. When I open my\
eyes every morning,\
0:42\
the world appears very disorienting.\
0:45\
Everything is out of focus,\
grainy, and distorted.\
0:49\
Even my dear husband is\
more reminiscent of\
0:52\
an abstract portrait than the\
well-loved and comforting figure\
0:56\
he really is. My reflexive need\
before I do anything else at\
1:01\
the start of my day is to reach\
1:04\
for my glasses to help me make sense\
of my surroundings and enjoy\
1:08\
a more vibrant experience as they help\
me navigate throughout my day.\
1:13\
Over the years, I've come to recognize\
that this behavior illustrates my daily\
1:18\
dependance on two things:\
1:20\
first, a tool that helps\
me to clarify, focus,\
1:24\
and ground the world around me;\
1:26\
and second, a need for tangible guidance\
to continually point me in\
1:31\
the right direction. This simple\
routine practice mirrors\
1:35\
to me a significant observation about\
our relationship with our Savior,\
1:40\
Jesus Christ. In our lives that are\
often filled with questions, worries,\
1:45\
pressures, and opportunities,\
1:47\
our Savior’s love for us individually\
and as His covenant children,\
1:52\
along with His teachings and laws,\
1:54\
are available daily resources that we\
can depend on to be a “light which\
1:58\
shineth, ... [enlightening our] eyes,\
2:01\
... [and quickening our]\
understandings.”\
2:04\
As we seek for the\
blessings of the Spirit in our lives,\
2:07\
we will be able to, as Jacob taught,\
2:09\
see “things as they really are,\
and ... as they really will be.”\
2:15\
As covenant children of God,\
2:16\
we have been uniquely blessed with\
2:18\
a rich supply of divinely appointed\
tools to improve our spiritual vision.\
2:24\
The words and teachings of Jesus Christ,\
2:26\
as recorded in scriptures and messages\
from His chosen prophets,\
2:30\
and His Spirit received through daily\
prayer, regular temple attendance,\
2:35\
and through the weekly ordinance of\
the sacrament, can help to provide\
2:39\
and restore peace and provide\
2:41\
the necessary gift of discernment\
that brings Christ's light\
2:45\
and His understanding to the\
corners of our life\
2:48\
and in a world that may be cloudy.\
2:51\
The Savior can also be our compass and\
our pilot as we steer through both\
2:56\
the calm and the turbulent\
waters of life.\
2:59\
He can make plain the correct path that\
leads us to our eternal destination.\
3:04\
So what would He have us see and\
where would He have us go?\
3:09\
Our dear Prophet has taught that “our\
focus must be riveted on the Savior\
3:12\
and His gospel” and that we must “strive\
to look unto Him in every thought.”\
3:18\
President Nelson has also promised\
that “nothing invites\
3:22\
the Spirit more than fixing your\
focus on Jesus Christ. ...\
3:25\
He will lead and guide you\
in your personal life\
3:29\
if you will make time for Him in\
your life—each and every day.\
3:34\
Friends, Jesus Christ is both\
the purpose of our focus and\
3:38\
the intent of our destination. To help\
us to remain fixed and heading in\
3:43\
the right direction, the Savior invites\
us to see our lives through Him in\
3:48\
order to see more of Him in our lives.\
3:52\
I've come to learn more about this\
specific invitation through my study of\
3:56\
the Old Testament. The law of Moses was\
given to the early Israelites as\
4:01\
a preparatory gospel designed\
to ready the people for\
4:04\
a higher covenant relationship with\
God through Jesus Christ.\
4:08\
The law, rich with symbolism\
4:10\
pointing believers to look\
forward to the coming\
4:13\
and Atonement of Jesus Christ, was meant\
to help the people of Israel focus\
4:18\
on the Savior by practicing\
faith in Him,\
4:21\
His sacrifice, and His laws and\
commandments in their lives—\
4:25\
intending to bring them to a greater\
understanding of their Redeemer.\
4:30\
Just as we are today, God’s ancient\
people were invited to see their lives\
4:35\
through Him in order to see more\
of Him in their lives.\
4:40\
But by the time of the\
Savior's ministry,\
4:43\
the Israelites had lost sight of\
Christ in their observances,\
4:46\
setting Him aside and adding to the law\
4:49\
unauthorized practices that had\
no instructive symbolism\
4:53\
pointing to the true and only source\
of their salvation and redemption—\
4:57\
Jesus Christ. The everyday world of the\
Israelites had become disoriented\
5:03\
and obscure. The children of Israel, in\
this state, believed that the practices\
5:08\
and rituals of the law were the path to\
personal salvation and in part reduced\
5:13\
the law of Moses to a set of protocols\
administered to rule civilian life.\
5:19\
This required the Savior to restore\
focus and clarity to His gospel.\
5:24\
Ultimately, a great portion of the\
Israelites rejected His message,\
5:29\
even going so far as to accuse the\
Savior—He who gave the law\
5:34\
and declared that He was the “law,\
and the light”—of breaking it.\
5:39\
Yet, Jesus, in His Sermon on the Mount,\
speaking on the law of Moses, declared,\
5:45\
“Think not that I am come to destroy\
the law, or the prophets:\
5:49\
I am not come to destroy,\
but to fulfill.”\
5:53\
Then the Savior, through His eternal\
Atonement, ended the codes,\
5:57\
regulations, and ceremonial\
practices observed by\
6:00\
the people of Israel at that time.\
6:02\
His final sacrifice led the shift from\
sacrificial burnt offerings to our\
6:07\
rendering of “a broken heart\
and a contrite spirit,” from\
6:11\
the ordinance of sacrifice to\
the ordinance of sacrament.\
6:16\
President M. Russell Ballard, teaching\
on the subject, said, “In a sense,\
6:20\
the sacrifice changed from the\
offering to the offerer.”\
6:24\
When we bring our offering\
to the Savior,\
6:26\
we are being invited to see more\
of Jesus Christ in our lives\
6:29\
as we humbly submit our will\
to Him in recognition\
6:33\
and understanding of His perfect\
submission to the will of the Father.\
6:38\
When we fix our sight on Jesus Christ,\
6:40\
we recognize and we understand\
that He is the only source\
6:44\
and way to receive forgiveness\
and redemption,\
6:47\
even unto eternal life and exaltation.\
As an early follower of the gospel,\
6:53\
I encountered many who observed and\
perceived changes in my behaviors,\
6:57\
practices, and choices after\
I joined the Church.\
7:01\
They were curious about the “whys”\
of what they were seeing—\
7:05\
why I chose to be baptized and join\
this congregation of believers,\
7:10\
even The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints;\
7:14\
why I refrained from certain\
practices on the Sabbath;\
7:18\
why I’m faithful in keeping\
the Word of Wisdom;\
7:22\
why I read the Book of Mormon;\
7:24\
why I believe in and incorporate the\
teachings of modern-day prophets\
7:28\
and apostles into my life; why I\
attend weekly church meetings;\
7:34\
Why I invite others to “come\
and see, come and help,\
7:38\
come and stay” and “come and belong.”\
7:41\
At the time, those questions felt\
overwhelming and, transparently,\
7:45\
sometimes accusatory. But as I grappled\
7:48\
with people’s scrutiny,\
7:50\
I came to realize that their\
probing was, in fact,\
7:53\
my first invitation to\
pick up and put on\
7:56\
a pair of spiritual lenses to clarify,\
7:59\
focus, and solidify what motivated\
my adherence to gospel practices\
8:04\
and standards. What was the\
source of my testimony?\
8:08\
Was I only carrying out “outward\
performances” without allowing those\
8:13\
practices connected to God’s laws\
to “strengthen [my] faith in Christ,”\
8:18\
or demonstrate understanding\
that Jesus Christ is\
8:22\
the only source of power\
in my observances?\
8:26\
Through rigorous effort to look to and\
8:28\
for Jesus Christ in my every\
thought and deed,\
8:31\
my eyes were enlightened and my\
understanding quickened to recognize\
8:35\
that Jesus Christ was calling\
for me to come unto Him.\
8:39\
From this early season of discipleship\
8:42\
in my youth, I can recall an invitation\
extended to me by\
8:45\
the missionaries to join them\
as they taught the gospel to\
8:48\
a group of young girls my age.\
8:50\
One evening, seated in the family\
home of one of these young women,\
8:54\
their tender question of why\
8:55\
I believe pricked my heart\
8:58\
and allowed me to testify to them\
with deepened understanding of\
9:01\
the Lord's vision about the spiritual\
motivations of my discipleship\
9:06\
and has refined my testimony\
going forward.\
9:10\
I learned then, as I know now, that\
our Savior, Jesus Christ,\
9:14\
directs our feet to meetinghouses each\
week to partake of His sacrament, to\
9:19\
the House of the Lord to\
make covenants with Him,\
9:22\
to the scriptures and teachings of\
prophets to learn of His words.\
9:26\
He directs our mouths to testify of Him,\
9:29\
our hands to lift and serve as He would\
lift and serve, our eyes to see\
9:35\
the world and each other as He does—\
as they “really are,\
9:38\
and ... as they really will be.” And as\
we allow Him to direct us in all things,\
9:44\
we receive testimony that “all things\
denote there is a God,”\
9:49\
because where we look for Him, we will\
find Him—each and every day.\
9:55\
This I testify in the sacred name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
10:00\
Amen.\
