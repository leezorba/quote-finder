What an honor to speak to you in\
this session of conference.\
0:04\
Today, I address you as friends.\
In the Gospel of John,\
0:08\
the Savior taught that we are His\
friends if we do what He asks us to do.\
0:14\
It is our individual and collective\
love of the Savior\
0:17\
and our covenants with Him\
that bind us together.\
0:22\
As President Eyring taught, “To you\
0:24\
I wish to say how much the Lord\
loves you and trusts you.\
0:28\
And, even more, I wish to tell you\
how much He depends on you.”\
0:33\
When I was called as a General Authority\
by President Nelson,\
0:37\
I was flooded with emotions.\
It was overwhelming.\
0:40\
Julie and I anxiously awaited\
0:42\
the Saturday afternoon session\
of general conference.\
0:45\
It was humbling to be sustained.\
0:48\
I carefully counted the steps\
to my designated seat so\
0:52\
as not to fall in my first assignment.\
0:56\
At the conclusion of that session,\
0:57\
something happened that had\
a profound effect on me.\
1:01\
The quorum members formed a line\
and greeted us one by one.\
1:06\
Each one shared their love and support.\
With a hearty abrazo,\
1:10\
they said, “Don’t worry, you belong.” In\
our relationship with the Savior,\
1:17\
He looks on the heart and is\
no respecter of persons.\
1:21\
Consider how He chose His Apostles.\
1:24\
He didn't pay attention\
to status or wealth.\
1:27\
He invites us to follow Him,\
1:29\
and I believe He reassures us\
that we belong with Him.\
1:34\
This message especially applies\
to the youth of the Church.\
1:38\
I see in you what President\
Nelson sees in you.\
1:41\
He said that “there is something\
undeniably special about this\
1:45\
generation of youth. Your Heavenly\
Father must have great confidence in\
1:49\
you to send you to earth at this time.\
You were born for greatness!”\
1:55\
I am grateful for what I\
learn from the youth.\
1:57\
I am grateful for what\
my children teach me, and\
2:00\
for what our missionaries teach\
me, and for what my nieces\
2:04\
and nephews teach me. Not too long ago,\
2:07\
I was working on our farm\
with my nephew, Nash.\
2:11\
He is six and has a pure heart.\
2:14\
He is my favorite nephew named Nash, and\
I believe I am his favorite uncle\
2:18\
speaking in conference today.\
2:21\
As he helped me come up with\
a solution for our project,\
2:24\
I said, “Nash, that is a great idea.\
How did you get so smart?”\
2:30\
He looked at me with an expression in\
his eyes that said, “Uncle Ryan,\
2:35\
how do you not know the answer\
to this question?”\
2:39\
He simply shrugged his shoulders,\
smiled, and confidently said, “Jesus.”\
2:46\
Nash reminded me that day of this\
simple and yet profound teaching.\
2:51\
The answer to the\
simplest questions and to\
2:55\
the most complex problems is always the\
same. The answer is Jesus Christ.\
3:03\
Every solution is found in Him.\
3:07\
In the Gospel of John, the Savior\
3:09\
said to His disciples that He would\
prepare a place for them.\
3:13\
Thomas was confused and said\
to the Savior, “Lord,\
3:16\
we know not whither thou goest; and\
how can we know the way?\
3:20\
Jesus sayeth unto him, I am the way,\
the truth, and the life;\
3:26\
no man cometh unto the Father\
but by me.”\
3:30\
The Savior taught His disciples that He\
is the way, the truth, and the life.\
3:36\
He is the answer to the question of\
how to come unto Heavenly Father.\
3:40\
Gaining a testimony of His divine role\
in our lives was something I learned\
3:45\
as a young man. While I was serving\
as a missionary in Argentina,\
3:50\
President Howard W. Hunter invited us to\
do something that had a profound effect\
3:55\
on my life. He said: “We must know Him.\
3:59\
We must know Christ better\
than we know Him;\
4:02\
we must remember Him more often\
than we remember Him.\
4:06\
We must serve Him more valiantly\
than we serve Him.”\
4:10\
At that time, I had been concerned with\
how to be a better missionary.\
4:14\
This was the answer—to know Christ,\
to remember Him, and to serve Him.\
4:21\
Missionaries throughout the world\
are united in this purpose\
4:25\
to invite others to come unto Christ\
by helping them receive\
4:29\
the restored gospel through faith\
in Him and His Atonement\
4:33\
and through repentance, baptism,\
4:34\
receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost,\
and enduring to the end.\
4:38\
To our friends who are listening\
to the missionaries,\
4:41\
I add my invitation to\
come unto Christ.\
4:45\
Together, we will strive to know Him,\
remember Him, and serve Him.\
4:53\
Serving a mission was a sacred\
time of my life.\
4:58\
In my last interview with him as a\
full-time missionary, President\
5:01\
Pincock spoke of the upcoming changes\
in mission leaders, as he\
5:05\
and his wife were also nearing the\
completion of their service.\
5:08\
We were both sad to be leaving something\
that we loved so much.\
5:12\
He could see that I was troubled\
by the thoughts of not being\
5:15\
a full-time missionary. He was a man of\
great faith and lovingly taught me,\
5:19\
as he had for the previous two years.\
5:23\
He pointed to the picture of Jesus\
Christ above his desk and said,\
5:27\
“Elder Olsen, it is all going to be\
OK because it is His work.”\
5:32\
I felt reassured knowing that\
5:33\
the Savior will help us not\
just while we are serving,\
5:36\
but always, if we will let Him.\
5:39\
Sister Pincock taught us from\
the depths of her heart in\
5:43\
the simplest Spanish phrases when\
she said, “JesuCristo vive,”\
5:49\
I knew it was true and that He lived.\
5:51\
When she said, “Elderes y\
Hermanas, les amo,”\
5:55\
I knew that she loved us and wanted\
us to follow the Savior always.\
6:01\
My wife and I were recently blessed to\
serve as mission leaders to labor with\
6:04\
the outstanding missionaries in Uruguay.\
6:07\
I would say that these were the best\
missionaries in the world,\
6:10\
and I trust that every mission\
leader feels that way.\
6:14\
These disciples taught us every day\
about following the Savior.\
6:18\
During regular interviews,\
6:20\
one of our great sister missionaries\
walked into the office.\
6:23\
She was a successful missionary,\
6:25\
an excellent trainer, and\
dedicated leader.\
6:28\
She was looked up to by her companions\
and loved by the people.\
6:31\
She was obedient, humble, and confident.\
6:35\
Our previous visits focused on her area\
and the people she was teaching.\
6:39\
This visit was different.\
6:41\
As I asked her how she was doing,\
I could tell she was troubled.\
6:45\
She said, “President Olsen, I don’t\
know if I can do this.\
6:49\
I don't know if I will\
ever be good enough.\
6:52\
I don't know if I can be\
the missionary that\
6:54\
the Lord needs me to be.” She was\
a remarkable missionary,\
6:59\
excellent in every way. A mission\
president's dream.\
7:04\
I had never worried about her\
abilities as a missionary.\
7:08\
As I listened to her, I struggled to\
know what to say. I silently prayed,\
7:13\
“Heavenly Father, this is an outstanding\
missionary. She is yours.\
7:19\
She is doing everything right.\
I don't want to mess this up.\
7:23\
Please help me know what to say.”\
The words came to me.\
7:28\
I said, “Hermana, I am so sorry\
you are feeling this way.\
7:31\
Let me ask you a question.\
7:33\
If you had a friend you were teaching\
who felt this way, what would you say?”\
7:38\
She looked at me and smiled with that\
unmistakable missionary spirit\
7:42\
and conviction. She said, “President,\
that is easy.\
7:45\
I would tell her that the Savior\
knows her perfectly.\
7:48\
I would tell her that He lives.\
He loves you.\
7:51\
You are good enough\
and you’ve got this.”\
7:54\
With a little chuckle, she said,\
7:55\
“I guess if that applies to our\
friends, that it also applies to me.”\
8:00\
When we have questions or doubts\
8:03\
we may feel that the solutions\
are too complex\
8:06\
or that finding answers\
is too confusing.\
8:10\
May we remember that the adversary,\
even the father of all lies,\
8:14\
is the architect of confusion. The\
Savior is the Master of simplicity.\
8:22\
President Nelson has said:\
“The adversary is clever.\
8:26\
For millennia, he has been making\
the good look evil and\
8:28\
[the] evil look good. His messages tend\
to be loud, bold, and boastful.\
8:34\
However, messages from our Heavenly\
Father are strikingly different.\
8:38\
He communicates simply, quietly,\
8:41\
and with such stunning plainness\
that we cannot misunderstand Him.”\
8:47\
How grateful we are that God so\
loved us that He sent His Son.\
8:52\
He is the answer. President Nelson\
recently said, “The gospel of\
8:56\
Jesus Christ has never been needed\
more than it is today. ...\
9:01\
This underscores the urgent\
need for us to follow\
9:04\
the Lord’s instructions to His disciples\
to ’go ... into all the world, and\
9:08\
preach the gospel to every creature.’”\
To those who will choose to serve,\
9:13\
I can attest to the blessings that will\
come as you heed a prophet's call.\
9:18\
Serving is not about you.\
It is about the Savior.\
9:22\
You will be called to a place,\
but more importantly,\
9:25\
you will be called to a people.\
9:28\
You will have the great responsibility\
9:29\
and blessing of helping new friends\
understand that the answer is Jesus.\
9:36\
This is The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints,\
9:40\
and this is where we belong.\
9:43\
Everything that President Nelson\
lovingly encourages us to do will lead\
9:47\
us closer to the Savior. To our\
magnificent youth—including my nephew,\
9:52\
Nash—throughout your life,\
9:54\
no matter how difficult or confusing\
the challenges may be,\
9:58\
you can always remember that\
the answer is simple.\
10:02\
It is always Jesus. As\
I have heard\
10:05\
those who we sustain as prophets, seers,\
and revelators say on many occasions,\
10:10\
I also say that we love you, we\
thank you, and we need you.\
10:15\
This is where you belong. I love the\
Savior. I bear witness of His name,\
10:21\
even Jesus Christ. I testify that He is\
the Author and Finisher of our faith,\
10:28\
and He is the master of simplicity.\
10:31\
The answer is Jesus. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
