Brothers and sisters, our\
beloved President,\
0:04\
Russell M. Nelson, will address\
us later in this session.\
0:09\
He's asked me to be the first speaker.\
0:13\
My subject today concerns what\
0:16\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints and its members give and do\
0:23\
for the poor and distressed.\
0:26\
I will also speak of similar giving\
by other good people.\
0:31\
Giving to those in need is a principle\
in all Abrahamic religions\
0:37\
and in others as well. A few months ago,\
0:41\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints reported for the first time\
0:47\
the extent of our humanitarian\
work worldwide.\
0:52\
Our 2021 expenditures for those in need\
in 188 countries worldwide was\
1:01\
906 million—almost $1 billion.\
1:07\
In addition, our members volunteered\
over 6 million hours of labor in\
1:13\
the same cause. Those figures are,\
of course,\
1:18\
an incomplete report of our\
giving and helping.\
1:22\
They do not include the personal\
services our members give individually\
1:27\
as they minister to one another\
in called positions\
1:31\
and voluntary member-to-member service.\
1:35\
And our 2021 report makes no mention\
of what our members do individually\
1:42\
through innumerable charitable\
organizations not formally connected\
1:48\
with our Church. I begin with these.\
1:53\
In 1831, less than two years after the\
Restored Church was organized,\
2:00\
the Lord gave this revelation\
to guide its members,\
2:03\
and, I believe, all of His\
children worldwide:\
2:08\
quote, “Behold, it is not meet that I\
should command in all things; for\
2:15\
he that is compelled in all things,\
the same is a slothful and\
2:20\
not a wise servant. ... Verily\
2:24\
I say, men should be anxiously\
engaged in a good cause,\
2:28\
and do many things of\
their own free will,\
2:32\
and bring to pass much righteousness;\
2:35\
For the power is in them, wherein they\
are agents unto themselves.\
2:41\
And inasmuch as men do good, they shall\
in no wise lose their reward.”\
2:48\
End quote.\
2:51\
In more than 38 years as an apostle\
2:55\
and over 30 years of professional\
employment,\
3:00\
I've seen many generous efforts by\
organizations and persons of\
3:06\
the kind this revelation describes\
as “a good cause”\
3:09\
and “bringing[ing] to pass\
much righteousness.”\
3:13\
There are uncounted examples of such\
humanitarian service throughout\
3:18\
the world, beyond our own borders\
and beyond our common knowledge.\
3:24\
Contemplating this, I think of\
3:26\
the Book of Mormon Prophet\
King Benjamin,\
3:29\
whose sermon included\
this eternal truth:\
3:33\
“when ye are in the service\
of your fellow beings\
3:37\
ye are only in the service of your God.”\
3:42\
Much welfare and humanitarian service\
to our fellow beings is taught\
3:47\
and practiced by The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints and by us\
3:53\
as its members. For example,\
3:56\
we fast at the first of each month\
and contribute at least\
4:01\
the equivalent of the uneaten meals\
to help those in need in our own\
4:06\
congregations. The Church also\
makes enormous contributions\
4:12\
for humanitarian and other services\
throughout the world.\
4:18\
Despite all that our Church\
does directly,\
4:23\
most humanitarian service to\
4:25\
the children of God worldwide\
is carried out by persons\
4:30\
and organizations having no formal\
connection with our Church.\
4:38\
As one of our apostles observed, quote:\
4:40\
“God is using more than one people for\
the accomplishment of His great and\
4:45\
marvelous work. ... It is too vast, too\
arduous for any one people.” End quote.\
4:55\
As members of the Restored Church,\
4:57\
we need to be more aware and more\
appreciative of the service of others.\
5:04\
The Church of Jesus Christ is committed\
to serving those in need,\
5:09\
and it is also committed to cooperating\
with others in that effort.\
5:16\
We recently made a large gift to the\
United Nations World Food Programme.\
5:23\
Over the many decades of\
our humanitarian work,\
5:27\
two organizations stand out\
as key collaborators.\
5:31\
Projects with the Red Cross\
and Red Crescent\
5:35\
agencies in dozens of countries\
have provided\
5:39\
the children of God crucial relief\
during natural disasters and conflicts.\
5:46\
Likewise, we have a long record\
of assistance with\
5:49\
Catholic Relief Services.\
5:52\
These organizations have taught us\
much about world-class relief.\
5:58\
We have also had fruitful collaborations\
with other organizations,\
6:03\
including Muslim Aid, Water for People\
and IsraAID, to name just a few.\
6:12\
While each humanitarian organization has\
its own areas of specialization,\
6:18\
we share the common goal of relieving\
suffering among God’s children.\
6:25\
All of this is part of God’s\
work for His children.\
6:32\
Modern revelation teaches that our\
Savior, Jesus Christ, is “the true light\
6:38\
that lighteth every man that\
cometh into the world.”\
6:44\
By this all the children of God\
are enlightened to serve Him\
6:49\
and one another to the best of\
their knowledge and ability.\
6:55\
The Book of Mormon teaches that\
“every thing which inviteth and\
6:58\
enticeth to do good, and to love God,\
and to serve him is inspired of God.”\
7:07\
Continuing: “For behold, the Spirit of\
Christ is given to every man, that He\
7:13\
may know good from evil; wherefore,\
I show unto you the way to judge;\
7:18\
for every thing which inviteth\
to do good, and to persuade\
7:22\
to believe in Christ, is sent forth\
by the power and gift of Christ. ...\
7:28\
And now, my brethren, ... ye know\
7:30\
the light by which ye may judge, which\
light is the light of Christ.”\
7:36\
End quote. Here are some examples of\
children of God helping other children\
7:43\
of God in their vital needs for food,\
medical care, and teaching.\
7:49\
Two years ago, the Kanhdaris,\
a Sikh husband and wife in\
7:55\
the United Arab Emirates, personally\
launched a remarkable effort to feed\
8:00\
the hungry. Through the Guru\
Nanak Darbar Sikh temple,\
8:06\
they are currently serving\
over 30,000\
8:10\
vegetarian meals every weekend to\
anyone who enters their doors,\
8:16\
regardless of religion or race.\
Dr. Kanhdari explains,\
8:21\
“We believe that all are one;\
8:23\
we are children of one God, and we are\
here to serve humanity.” End quote.\
8:30\
The provision of medical and dental\
care to those in need is another\
8:34\
example. In Chicago I met\
8:37\
a Syrian-American critical care\
physician, Dr. Zaher Sahloul.\
8:44\
He is one of the founders of MedGlobal,\
8:47\
which organizes medical professionals\
to volunteer their time, skills,\
8:52\
knowledge, and leadership to help others\
in crisis, such as in the Syrian war,\
8:58\
where Dr. Sahloul risked his life in\
giving medical care to civilians.\
9:05\
MedGlobal and similar organizations\
9:08\
(including many Latter-day\
Saint professionals)\
9:11\
demonstrate that God is moving\
professionals of faith to bring\
9:17\
the poor and needy relief worldwide.\
9:23\
Many unselfish children of God are\
involved in teaching efforts, also\
9:27\
worldwide. A good example known to us\
through our humanitarian efforts is\
9:33\
the activity of a man known\
as Mr. Gabriel,\
9:37\
who has been a refugee from various\
conflicts on several occasions.\
9:42\
He recently observed that hundreds of\
thousands of refugee children in\
9:47\
East Africa needed help to keep their\
hopes alive and their minds active.\
9:54\
He organized other teachers in\
9:56\
the refugee population in what\
they called “tree schools,”\
10:02\
where children were gathered for lessons\
under the shade of a tree.\
10:07\
He did not wait for others\
to organize or direct\
10:10\
but personally led efforts that have\
provided learning opportunities\
10:15\
for thousands of primary school children\
during stressful years of\
10:21\
displacement. Of course, these three\
examples do not mean that everything\
10:26\
said or done by organizations or\
individuals purporting to be good\
10:32\
or of God is truly that. These examples\
do show that God inspires many\
10:39\
organizations and individuals\
to do much good.\
10:45\
It also shows that more of us should be\
recognizing the good done by others\
10:50\
and supporting it as we have the\
time and means to do so.\
10:56\
Here are some examples of service\
the Church supports\
11:00\
and which our members and\
other good people\
11:02\
and organizations also support with\
individual donations of time and money.\
11:09\
I begin with religious freedom.\
In supporting that,\
11:13\
we serve our own interests but also\
the interests of other religions.\
11:19\
As our first President,\
Joseph Smith, taught,\
11:23\
“We claim the privilege of worshiping\
Almighty God according to\
11:27\
the dictates of our own conscience and\
allow all men the same privilege,\
11:33\
let them worship how, where,\
or what they may.”\
11:39\
Other examples of the Restored Church’s\
11:41\
humanitarian and other assistance that\
are also supported voluntarily by our\
11:46\
members are our well-known schools,\
colleges, and universities,\
11:52\
and our less well-known\
but now-published\
11:55\
large donations for the relief of those\
suffering from the destructions\
12:00\
and dislocations of natural disasters\
like tornadoes and earthquakes.\
12:06\
Other charitable activities our members\
support by their voluntary donations\
12:11\
and efforts are too numerous to list,\
12:14\
but just mentioning these few will\
suggest their variety and importance:\
12:19\
combating racism and other prejudices,\
12:22\
research on how to prevent and cure\
diseases, helping the disabled,\
12:28\
supporting music organizations,\
12:31\
and improving the moral and physical\
environment for all.\
12:36\
All of the humanitarian efforts of\
12:39\
the Church of Jesus Christ seek\
to follow the example of\
12:43\
a righteous people described in\
the Book of Mormon. Quote:\
12:47\
“And thus, in their prosperous\
circumstances,\
12:50\
they did not send away any who were\
naked, or that were hungry,\
12:55\
or that were sick, ... and they ... were\
liberal to all, both old and young,\
12:59\
both bond and free, both\
male and female,\
13:03\
whether out of the church or in\
the church.” End quote.\
13:08\
I testify of Jesus Christ,\
13:11\
whose light and Spirit guides all of\
the children of God in helping\
13:16\
the poor and distressed throughout the\
world in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
13:22\
Amen.\
