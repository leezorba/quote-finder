Defining moments in life come\
often and unexpectedly,\
0:05\
even when you're still young.\
0:07\
Allow me to share a story about\
0:09\
a high school student, Kevin, chosen\
to travel out of state for\
0:14\
a student leader event, as\
told in his own words:\
0:19\
“My turn in line came and the official-\
looking registration clerk asked\
0:23\
for my name. She looked\
at her list and said,\
0:26\
‘So you’re the young man from Utah?’\
‘You mean I’m the only one?’ I asked.\
0:32\
‘Yes, the only one.’ She\
handed me my nametag\
0:36\
with ‘Utah’ printed below\
my name. As I clipped it on,\
0:42\
I felt like I was being branded.\
0:44\
I crowded into the hotel elevator with\
five other high school students with\
0:48\
nametags like mine. ‘Hey, you’re\
from Utah. Are you a Mormon?’\
0:54\
asked one student. I felt out of place\
with all these student leaders from\
0:59\
all over the country. ‘Yes,’\
I hesitantly admitted.\
1:04\
’You’re the guys who believe in Joseph\
Smith, who said he saw angels.\
1:09\
You don’t actually believe that,\
do you?′\
1:12\
I didn’t know what to say.\
The students in\
1:15\
the elevator were all staring at me.\
1:17\
I had just arrived and already everyone\
thought I was different.\
1:23\
I became a little defensive,\
but then said,\
1:27\
‘I know that Joseph Smith\
was a prophet of God.’\
1:31\
‘Where had that come from?’ I wondered.\
I didn’t know I had it in me.\
1:36\
But the words felt true.\
1:39\
‘Yeah, I was told you were just\
religious nuts,’ he said.\
1:42\
With that, there was an uncomfortable\
pause as the elevator door opened.\
1:47\
As we gathered our luggage, he walked\
down the hall laughing.\
1:53\
Then a voice behind me asked,\
’Hey, don’t Mormons have\
1:55\
some sort of another Bible?′\
Oh, no, not again! I turned to see\
2:00\
another student who had been\
in the elevator with me, Christopher.\
2:04\
‘It’s called the Book of Mormon,’\
I said,\
2:08\
wanting to drop the subject.\
2:09\
I picked up my bags and started\
walking down the hall.\
2:14\
‘Is that the book Joseph Smith\
translated?’ he asked.\
2:18\
‘Yes, it is,’ I answered.\
I kept on walking,\
2:21\
hoping to avoid embarrassment. ‘Well,\
do you know how I could get one?’\
2:29\
A scripture I learned in seminary\
suddenly came to me:\
2:32\
‘I’m not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ.’ As this entered my mind,\
2:38\
I felt ashamed that I’d been so\
embarrassed. For the rest of\
2:42\
the week that scripture\
wouldn’t leave me.\
2:44\
I answered as many questions about\
the Church as I could,\
2:47\
and I made many friends. I discovered\
I was proud of my religion.\
2:53\
I gave Christopher a Book of Mormon.\
2:55\
He later wrote me telling me he had\
invited the missionaries to his home.\
3:01\
I learned not to be embarrassed\
to share my testimony.”\
3:05\
I’m inspired by Kevin’s courage.\
By the way,\
3:09\
he’s now a bishop serving in Indiana.\
3:13\
It's a courage repeated every\
day by faithful members of\
3:17\
the Church throughout the world.\
As I share my thoughts,\
3:22\
I invite you to reflect upon\
these four questions:\
3:27\
Do I understand what a testimony is?\
Do I know how to bear my testimony?\
3:33\
What are the obstacles in sharing my\
testimony? How do I keep my testimony?\
3:41\
Your testimony is a most\
precious possession,\
3:44\
often associated with deep\
spiritual feelings.\
3:48\
These feelings are usually communicated\
quietly and described as\
3:54\
“a still small voice.” It is your belief\
or knowledge of truth given as\
4:00\
a spiritual witness through the\
influence of the Holy Ghost.\
4:05\
Acquiring this witness will change\
what you say and how you act.\
4:12\
Key elements of your testimony\
confirmed by\
4:15\
the Holy Ghost include five elements:\
God is your Heavenly Father; you are\
4:21\
His child. He loves you.\
Jesus Christ lives.\
4:29\
He is the Son of the living God\
and your Savior and Redeemer.\
4:34\
Joseph Smith is a prophet of God\
4:37\
called to restore the Church\
of Jesus Christ.\
4:41\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\
day Saints is God’s restored Church\
4:46\
on the earth.\
4:49\
The restored Church of Jesus Christ\
is led by a living prophet today.\
4:59\
You bear your testimony when you share\
spiritual feelings with others.\
5:04\
As a member of the Church,\
5:06\
opportunities to bear your spoken\
testimony come in formal church\
5:11\
meetings or in less formal, one-on-one\
conversations with family, friends,\
5:16\
and others. Another way you share your\
testimony is through your righteous\
5:22\
behavior. Your testimony in Jesus\
Christ isn’t just what you say,\
5:29\
it’s who you are. Each time\
you bear vocal witness\
5:36\
or demonstrate through your actions your\
commitment to follow Jesus Christ,\
5:40\
you invite others to “come unto Christ.”\
5:43\
Members of the Church “stand as\
witnesses of God at all times\
5:47\
and in all places.” Opportunities to\
do this in the digital universe,\
5:53\
using inspiring content of our own\
5:57\
or sharing uplifting content prepared\
by others, are endless.\
6:03\
We testify when we love, share,\
and invite—even online.\
6:11\
Your tweets, direct messages,\
and posts will take on\
6:15\
a higher, holier purpose when you also\
use social media to show how\
6:22\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
shapes your life.\
6:27\
Obstacles to sharing your testimony may\
include uncertainty about what to say.\
6:34\
Matthew Cowley, an early Apostle,\
6:37\
shared this experience\
as he departed on\
6:40\
a five-year mission at age\
17 to New Zealand.\
6:45\
Quote: “I will never forget ... the day\
I left [my father’s] last words to me,\
6:51\
’My boy, [when you] go out on that\
mission; ... and sometimes when you’re\
6:57\
called upon, you will think you’re\
wonderfully prepared,\
6:59\
but when you stand up, your mind\
will go completely blank.′ ...\
7:04\
I said, ‘What do you do when\
your mind goes blank?’\
7:08\
He said, ’You stand up there and with\
all the fervor of your soul,\
7:12\
you will bear witness that Joseph Smith\
was a prophet of the living God,\
7:16\
and thoughts will flood into your\
mind and words to your mouth ...\
7:20\
to the heart of everyone who listens.′\
7:23\
And so my mind, being mostly\
blank during my ... mission ...\
7:27\
gave me the opportunity to bear\
testimony to the greatest event in\
7:33\
the history of the world since the\
crucifixion [and resurrection] of\
7:37\
the Master. Try it sometime,\
[boys] and girls,\
7:41\
if you don’t have anything else to say,\
7:44\
testify that Joseph Smith\
was the prophet of God,\
7:49\
and the whole history of\
the Church will flood into your mind.”\
7:54\
Close quote.\
7:58\
Likewise, President Dallin H. Oaks\
shared, “Sometimes testimonies\
8:02\
are better gained on the feet\
8:04\
bearing them than on the\
knees praying for them.”\
8:08\
The Spirit bears witness to the\
speaker and listener alike.\
8:12\
Another obstacle, as Kevin’s\
story emphasized, is fear.\
8:16\
as Paul wrote to Timothy:\
8:18\
“God hath not given us the spirit of\
fear; but of power, and of love.\
8:23\
Be not thou ashamed of the testimony\
of our Lord.”\
8:27\
You see, feelings of fear don't\
come from the Lord,\
8:31\
but most often from the adversary.\
8:33\
Having faith, as Kevin did,\
8:35\
will allow you to overcome\
these feelings\
8:37\
and freely share what is in your heart.\
How do I keep my testimony?\
8:46\
I believe a testimony\
is innate within us.\
8:49\
Yet, in order to keep it and more\
fully develop it,\
8:55\
Alma taught that we must nourish our\
testimony with much care. As we do\
9:00\
so it will get root and grow\
up and bring forth fruit.\
9:04\
Without this, it withers away.\
9:08\
Each beloved member of the First\
Presidency has provided us with\
9:11\
direction on how to keep a testimony.\
President Henry B. Eyring\
9:15\
lovingly taught\
us that ’feasting on the word of God,\
9:19\
heartfelt prayer, and obedience to the\
Lord’s commandments must be applied\
9:24\
for your testimony to grow and prosper.”\
9:27\
President Dallin H. Oaks reminded\
us to retain our testimony\
9:31\
“we need to partake of the sacrament\
each week to qualify for the\
9:35\
precious promise that we will ‘always\
have His Spirit to be with [us.]’”\
9:40\
And President Nelson kindly\
counseled recently\
9:43\
and emphasized again this morning, “Feed\
[your testimony] truth. ... Nourish\
9:49\
yourself in the words of ancient\
[prophets] and modern prophets.\
9:52\
Ask the Lord to teach you\
how to hear Him better.\
9:57\
Spend more time in temple\
and family history work. ...\
10:01\
Make your testimony your\
highest priority.”\
10:05\
My beloved brothers and sisters,\
I promise you\
10:08\
as you more fully understand what\
a testimony is and as you share it,\
10:13\
you will overcome obstacles\
of uncertainty and fear,\
10:16\
enabling you to nurture and keep\
this most precious possession,\
10:21\
your testimony. We’re blessed to have\
countless examples of ancient\
10:25\
and modern-day prophets who have\
boldly borne their testimonies.\
10:30\
Following Christ’s death, Peter\
stood and testified:\
10:33\
“Be it known unto you all, ... that\
by the name of Jesus Christ ...\
10:37\
doth this man stand here before you. ...\
10:40\
For there is none other name under\
heaven given among men whereby we must\
10:45\
be saved.” Amulek, following Alma’s\
sermon on faith, stated powerfully,\
10:50\
“I will testify unto you of myself\
that these things are true.\
10:54\
Behold, I say unto you that I do know\
that Christ shall come among\
10:58\
the children of men, ... and He shall\
atone for [all] the sins of the world;\
11:03\
for the Lord God hath spoken it.”\
11:06\
Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon,\
11:08\
upon witnessing a glorious vision of\
the resurrected Savior, testified:\
11:15\
“And now, after the many testimonies\
which have been given of him,\
11:18\
this is the testimony ... which we give\
of him: That he lives! For\
11:24\
we saw him, even on the\
right hand of God;\
11:26\
and we heard the voice bearing record\
that he is the Only Begotten of\
11:31\
the Father.” Brothers and sisters,\
11:35\
I invite you to seek opportunities\
to bear your testimony in word\
11:38\
and in deed. Such an opportunity came\
to me recently at the end of\
11:44\
a meeting with the mayor of a capital\
city in South America,\
11:48\
in his chambers with a number\
of his cabinet officials.\
11:53\
As we concluded with very\
cordial feelings,\
11:55\
I hesitantly thought I should\
share my testimony.\
11:59\
Following the prompting, I offered\
a witness that Jesus Christ is\
12:05\
the Son of the living God and\
the Savior of the world.\
12:10\
Everything changed at that moment. The\
Spirit in the room was undeniable.\
12:15\
It seemed everyone was touched.\
12:18\
The Comforter beareth record of\
the Father and the Son.\
12:22\
I'm so grateful I summoned the\
courage to bear my testimony.\
12:28\
When a moment like this comes,\
grab it and embrace it.\
12:32\
You’ll feel the warmth of the Comforter\
inside you when you do.\
12:36\
I offer my testimony and witness to you.\
God is our Heavenly Father.\
12:42\
Jesus Christ lives, and The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is\
12:47\
God’s Church on the earth today,\
12:50\
led by our dear prophet, President\
Russell M. Nelson.\
12:55\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
