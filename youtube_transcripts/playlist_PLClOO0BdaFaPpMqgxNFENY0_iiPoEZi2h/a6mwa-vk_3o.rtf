Over the years from this beautiful\
pulpit at the Conference Center,\
0:06\
we have received magnificent counsel,\
inspiration,\
0:09\
instruction, and revelation.\
0:11\
On occasion, speakers have used\
comparisons associated with their areas\
0:16\
of knowledge and experience to\
illustrate clearly and powerfully\
0:20\
a principle of the gospel of\
Jesus Christ. In this way,\
0:24\
for example, we have learned about\
airplanes and flights in which\
0:28\
a tiny initial deviation can lead us to\
0:30\
a place far from our original\
destination.\
0:34\
Also in this way, we have learned\
from a comparison of\
0:37\
the function of our physical heart with\
0:40\
the powerful change of heart\
required to respond to\
0:42\
the Lord’s invitation to follow Him.\
0:46\
This time I would like to humbly add a\
comparison inspired from an area in\
0:51\
the field of my professional\
preparation.\
0:53\
I'm referring to the world\
of civil engineering.\
0:57\
From the beginning of my\
university studies,\
1:00\
I dreamed of the day when\
I would complete\
1:03\
the requirements to be\
qualified to take\
1:05\
the class that would teach me\
how to design buildings\
1:09\
and other structures that could\
then be considered “anti-seismic.”\
1:16\
The day finally arrived for my\
first class on this subject.\
1:21\
The first words from the professor\
were the following:\
1:25\
“You’re surely anxious\
to begin this course\
1:27\
and learn how to design anti-seismic\
structures,” to which many of us eagerly\
1:34\
nodded our heads. Then\
the professor said,\
1:39\
“I’m sorry to tell you that\
this is not possible,\
1:42\
for I cannot teach you how to design\
1:45\
a building that is against, that\
is ‘anti-,’ or that is opposed to\
1:51\
an earthquake. This makes\
no sense,” he said,\
1:54\
“because earthquakes will occur anyway,\
whether we like it or not.”\
2:01\
Then, he added, “What I can teach you is\
how to design structures that are\
2:07\
seismic resistant, a structure that\
can resist the forces coming from\
2:12\
an earthquake so that the structure\
remains standing without suffering any\
2:17\
serious damage and can then continue\
offering the service\
2:21\
for which it had been conceived.”\
2:24\
The engineer makes the calculations\
that indicate the dimensions,\
2:28\
the qualities, and characteristics of\
the foundations, columns, beams,\
2:32\
concrete slabs, and other structural\
elements being designed.\
2:36\
These results are translated into plans\
and technical specifications,\
2:42\
which must be strictly followed\
by the builder in order for\
2:46\
the work to materialize and\
thus fulfill the purpose\
2:50\
for which it was designed\
and is being built.\
2:54\
Although more than 40 years have passed\
since that first class in seismic-\
2:58\
resistant engineering, I perfectly\
remember the moment when\
3:02\
I began to acquire a deeper,\
3:04\
more complete understanding of\
3:06\
the vital importance that this concept\
would be present in the structures that\
3:11\
I would design in my future\
professional life.\
3:14\
Not only that, but\
even more important,\
3:17\
that it would be permanently present\
in the edification of my own life\
3:21\
and in those over whom I might exercise\
a positive influence.\
3:26\
How blessed we are to count\
on a knowledge of\
3:29\
the plan of salvation created\
by our Heavenly Father,\
3:33\
to have the Restored Gospel of\
Jesus Christ, and to rely on\
3:37\
the inspired direction\
of living prophets.\
3:40\
All the former constitute the\
divine-laid plans and\
3:44\
the technical specifications that teach\
us clearly how to construct happy\
3:49\
lives, lives that are resistant to sin,\
resistant to temptation,\
3:54\
resistant to attacks from Satan, who is\
desperately seeking to frustrate our\
4:00\
eternal destiny—to be together with\
our Heavenly Father and with our\
4:04\
beloved families. The Savior Himself,\
at the beginning of His ministry,\
4:10\
“was left to be tempted of the devil.”\
4:13\
But Jesus emerged successful\
from that great trial.\
4:16\
How would having had an\
attitude of anti-Satan\
4:20\
or anti-temptation have served Him?\
4:23\
What made Jesus emerge triumphant from\
these most difficult moments was His\
4:28\
spiritual preparation, which permitted\
Him to be in a condition to resist\
4:33\
the temptations of the adversary.\
4:35\
What were some of the factors that\
helped the Savior to be prepared\
4:40\
for that crucial moment? First, he had\
fasted for 40 days and 40 nights,\
4:46\
a fast that must have been accompanied\
by constant prayer.\
4:49\
So although physically weak,\
His spirit was very strong.\
4:55\
Even though, fortunately, we are not\
asked to fast for such a duration,\
4:58\
rather for only 24 hours\
and once a month,\
5:02\
fasting brings us spiritual strength\
and prepares us to be resistant to\
5:06\
the trials of this life. In second\
place, in the account of\
5:11\
the temptations to which the\
Savior was submitted,\
5:14\
we see that He always answered Satan\
having scriptures in His mind,\
5:19\
holding them, and applying them at\
5:21\
the right moment. When Satan tempted Him\
to convert the stones into bread\
5:26\
so that He could satisfy His\
hunger from His long fast,\
5:30\
the Lord said to him, “It is written:\
Man shall not live by bread alone,\
5:36\
but by every word that proceedeth\
out of the mouth of God.”\
5:41\
Then when the Lord was on the\
pinnacle of the temple,\
5:44\
the devil tried to tempt Him\
to demonstrate His power,\
5:47\
to which the Lord answered with\
authority: “It is written again,\
5:52\
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.”\
5:56\
And to Satan’s third attempt, the\
Lord responded, “It is written,\
6:01\
Thou shall worship the Lord thy God,\
and Him only shalt thou serve.”\
6:07\
The event of an earthquake\
leaves its mark\
6:11\
even on structures that were correctly\
designed and built.\
6:15\
Such consequences are perhaps some\
cracks, fallen furniture or ceilings,\
6:19\
broken windows, et cetera. But\
this well-designed\
6:23\
and well-built edifice will fulfill its\
purpose of protecting its occupants,\
6:29\
and with some repairs, it will\
recuperate its original condition.\
6:34\
In similar fashion, the buffeting of\
the adversary can also cause “cracks”\
6:39\
or some partial damage in our lives,\
6:41\
in spite of our efforts to build\
our lives according to\
6:44\
the perfect divine design.\
6:47\
These cracks can manifest\
themselves through feelings of sadness\
6:52\
or remorse for having committed\
some errors and\
6:56\
for not having done\
everything perfectly,\
6:59\
or for feeling that we are not\
as good as we want to be.\
7:03\
But what is truly relevant is\
that for having followed\
7:06\
the divinely designed plans\
and specifications,\
7:09\
that is, the gospel of Jesus Christ,\
we are still standing.\
7:15\
The structure of our lives has not\
been demolished because of\
7:18\
the adversary's efforts or\
7:20\
for difficult situations that\
we have had to face;\
7:25\
rather, we are ready to move forward.\
7:28\
The joy promised in the scriptures as\
7:31\
the purpose of our existence should not\
be understood to mean that we will\
7:35\
have no difficulties or sorrows,\
7:37\
that we’ll have no cracks\
as consequences\
7:40\
of the temptations, of adversity,\
7:43\
or from the actual trials\
of our earth life.\
7:46\
This joy has to do with Nephi’s\
perspective on life\
7:50\
when he said, “Having seen many\
afflictions in the course of my days,\
7:55\
nevertheless, having been highly\
favored of the Lord in all my days.”\
8:01\
All his days! Even the days that Nephi\
suffered during the incomprehension\
8:06\
and rejections of his own brothers; even\
when they tied him up on the ship;\
8:11\
even the day that his father, Lehi,\
passed away;\
8:15\
even when Laman and Lemuel became\
mortal enemies of his people—\
8:21\
even in those difficult days, Nephi\
felt highly favored of the Lord.\
8:28\
We can have the tranquility\
of knowing that\
8:30\
the Lord will never permit us to be\
tempted beyond what we can resist.\
8:35\
Alma invites us to “watch and pray\
continually, that [we] may not be\
8:41\
tempted above that which [we] can bear,\
and thus be led by the Holy Spirit,\
8:46\
becoming humble, meek, submissive,\
patient,\
8:50\
full of love and all long-suffering.”\
8:54\
The same can be applied\
to the trials of life.\
8:58\
Ammon reminds us of the\
words of the Lord:\
9:01\
“Go and bear with patience\
thine afflictions, and\
9:05\
I will give unto you success.”\
9:08\
The Lord always provides us with an\
escape when we face adversity,\
9:13\
temptation, incomprehension,\
infirmities, and even death.\
9:18\
He has said, “And now, verily I say unto\
you, and what I say and to one I say\
9:25\
and to all, be of good cheer,\
little children;\
9:30\
for I am in your midst, and\
I have not forsaken you.”\
9:34\
He will never abandon us!\
9:37\
I pray that we may continue to build\
our lives following the plans\
9:41\
and technical specifications of\
9:43\
the divine design authored\
by our Father\
9:46\
and achieved through our\
Savior, Jesus Christ.\
9:50\
Thus, because of the grace that reaches\
us through the Atonement of our Savior,\
9:54\
we will be successful in constructing\
a life resistant to sin,\
9:59\
resistant to temptation, and\
strengthened to endure the sad,\
10:02\
difficult times in our lives.\
10:05\
And furthermore, we will be\
in condition to access all\
10:08\
the blessings promised through\
the love of our Father\
10:11\
and our Savior. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
