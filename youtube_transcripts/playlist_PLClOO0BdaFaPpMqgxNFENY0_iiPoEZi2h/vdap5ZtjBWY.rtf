My beloved brothers and sisters, thanks\
to all for this inspiring session!\
0:10\
Since our conference last April,\
we have witnessed many\
0:13\
world events,\
0:15\
ranging from the heartbreaking\
to the sublime.\
0:21\
We are delighted with reports of large\
youth conferences being held throughout\
0:26\
the world. At these conferences,\
0:30\
our noble youth are learning that no\
matter what happens in their lives,\
0:36\
their greatest strength\
comes from the Lord.\
0:43\
We rejoice that more temples are\
being built across the world.\
0:48\
With the dedication of each new temple\
0:52\
additional godly power comes into\
the world to strengthen us\
0:58\
and counteract the intensifying\
efforts of the adversary.\
1:05\
Abuse constitutes the influence of the\
adversary. It is a grievous sin.\
1:16\
As President of the Church,\
1:17\
I affirm the teachings of the Lord\
Jesus Christ on this issue.\
1:23\
Let me be perfectly clear:\
1:27\
any kind of abuse of women,\
1:30\
children, or anyone is an abomination\
to the Lord. He grieves\
1:40\
and I grieve whenever anyone is harmed.\
1:45\
He mourns, and we all mourn,\
1:49\
for each person who has fallen\
victim to abuse of any kind.\
1:56\
Those who perpetrate these hideous\
acts are not only accountable to\
2:02\
the laws of man, but will also face\
the wrath of Almighty God.\
2:11\
For decades now, the Church has taken\
extensive measures to protect—in\
2:17\
particular—children from abuse. There\
are many aids on the Church website.\
2:28\
I invite you to study them.\
2:31\
These guidelines are in place\
to protect the innocent.\
2:36\
I urge each of us to be alert to anyone\
who might be in danger of being abused\
2:43\
and to act promptly to protect them.\
The Savior will not tolerate abuse,\
2:52\
and as His disciples, neither can we.\
2:59\
The adversary has other\
disturbing tactics.\
3:03\
Among them are his efforts to blur\
the line between what is true\
3:09\
and what is not true.\
3:12\
The flood of information available\
at our fingertips, ironically,\
3:17\
makes it increasingly difficult\
to determine what is true.\
3:24\
This challenge reminds me of an\
experience Sister Nelson and\
3:29\
I had when we visited a dignitary in\
3:33\
a country where relatively few people\
have heard of Jesus Christ.\
3:40\
This dear, aging friend had\
recently been quite ill.\
3:47\
He told us that during\
his many days in bed\
3:52\
he often stared at the ceiling\
and asked, “What is true?”\
4:02\
Many on earth today are only\
kept from the truth\
4:04\
because they know not where to find it.\
4:07\
Some would have us believe\
that truth is relative,\
4:12\
that each person should determine for\
himself or herself what is true.\
4:19\
Such a belief is but wishful thinking\
for those who mistakenly\
4:25\
think they will not\
4:27\
also be accountable to God.\
4:32\
Dear brothers and sisters, God\
is the source of all truth.\
4:41\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints embraces all truth that God\
4:47\
conveys to His children, whether learned\
in a scientific laboratory\
4:53\
or received by direct\
revelation from Him.\
4:59\
From this pulpit today and tomorrow,\
you will continue to hear truth.\
5:06\
Please make notes of thoughts\
that catch your attention\
5:10\
and those that come into your\
mind and stay in your heart.\
5:16\
Prayerfully ask the Lord to confirm\
that what you have heard is true.\
5:26\
I love you, my dear brothers\
and sisters.\
5:30\
I pray that this conference\
will provide\
5:34\
the spiritual feast you are seeking. In\
the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
5:42\
Amen.\
