Last year, while serving in the\
Asia North Area\
0:03\
Presidency, I received a call from\
President Russell M.\
0:06\
Nelson inviting me to serve as a\
Second Counselor in\
0:09\
the Presiding Bishopric.\
0:11\
He graciously invited my wife,\
Laurie, to join\
0:13\
the conversation.\
0:15\
After the call was finished, we\
were still in\
0:17\
a state of disbelief when my wife\
asked, "What does the Presiding\
0:20\
Bishopric do anyway?" After a\
moment to reflect that,\
0:25\
I responded, "I don't know."\
Exactly a year later, and after\
0:29\
profound feelings of humility and\
gratitude, I can answer my\
0:33\
wife's question with greater\
understanding.\
0:36\
Among many other things, The\
Presiding Bishopric oversees\
0:39\
the welfare and humanitarian work\
of the Church.\
0:42\
The work now spans the entire\
globe and blesses more of God's\
0:46\
children than ever before.\
0:48\
As a Presiding Bishopric, we are\
assisted by wonderful Church\
0:52\
employees and others, including\
the Relief Society General\
0:55\
Presidency, who serve with us on\
the Church's Welfare\
0:58\
and Self-Reliance Executive\
Committee.\
1:00\
In our capacity as members of that\
committee, the First\
1:04\
Presidency asked me- as well as\
Sister Sharon Eubank, who\
1:08\
spoke to us last evening-to share\
with you an update on\
1:11\
the Church's recent humanitarian\
efforts.\
1:14\
They also particularly requested\
that we express their profound\
1:17\
gratitude-because brothers and\
sisters, it is you who have\
1:21\
made those humanitarian efforts\
possible.\
1:24\
As we observed with concern the\
early economic effects of\
1:27\
the COVID-19 crisis across the\
world, we could have easily\
1:31\
expected a decline in the monetary\
contributions which\
1:34\
the Saints were able to give.\
1:36\
After all, our own members were\
not immune to the setbacks from\
1:39\
the pandemic.\
1:40\
Imagine our feelings when we\
observe just the opposite.\
1:44\
Humanitarian donations in 2020\
turned out to be the highest ever\
1:48\
and are trending even higher this\
year.\
1:51\
As a result of your generosity,\
the Church has been\
1:54\
able to realize its most extensive\
response since\
1:57\
the inception of the Humanitarian\
Fund, with over\
2:00\
1,500 COVID relief projects in\
more than150 countries.\
2:05\
These donations, which you have\
given so selflessly to the\
2:08\
Lord, have been converted to life-\
sustaining food,\
2:12\
oxygen, medical supplies, and\
vaccinations for those who\
2:16\
might otherwise have gone without.\
2:19\
Just as significant as the\
contributions of goods is\
2:22\
the tremendous outpouring of time\
and energy which Church members\
2:25\
donate to humanitarian causes.\
2:28\
Even as the pandemic has raged,\
natural disasters, civil\
2:31\
conflict, and economic instability\
have been unrelenting and have\
2:35\
continued to drive millions of\
people from their homes.\
2:38\
The United Nations now reports\
that there are over 82 million\
2:42\
forcibly displaced people in the\
world.\
2:44\
Add to this the millions of others\
who elect to flee from\
2:47\
poverty or oppression in search of\
a better life for themselves\
2:50\
or their children.\
2:51\
And you can begin to catch a\
glimpse of the magnitude of\
2:55\
this global situation.\
2:57\
I am pleased to report that thanks\
to the volunteer time\
2:59\
and talents of so many, the church\
operates refugee\
3:03\
and immigrant welcome centers in\
multiple locations in the United\
3:06\
States and Europe.\
3:07\
And thanks to your contributions,\
we provide good\
3:11\
funding and volunteers to help\
similar programs run by other\
3:15\
organizations throughout the\
world.\
3:18\
May I extend my heartfelt\
gratitude to those Saints who\
3:22\
have reached out to feed, clothe,\
befriend, and help these\
3:26\
refugees become established and\
self-sufficient.\
3:29\
Yesterday evening, Sister Eubank\
shared with you a few of\
3:32\
the Saints' wonderful efforts in\
this regard.\
3:35\
As I reflect on these efforts, my\
thoughts often turn\
3:38\
to the principle of sacrifice and\
the direct connection of this\
3:42\
principle to the two great\
commandments of loving God\
3:46\
and loving our neighbor.\
3:48\
In modern usage, the term\
sacrifice has come to connote\
3:51\
the concept of "giving up" things\
for the Lord in His kingdom.\
3:56\
However, in ancient days, the\
meaning of the word sacrifice\
3:59\
was more closely tied to its two\
Latin roots: sacer, meaning\
4:03\
"sacred or holy." and facere,\
meaning "to make."\
4:08\
Thus, anciently sacrifice meant\
literally "to make something\
4:12\
or someone holy." Viewed as such,\
sacrifice is a process\
4:17\
of becoming holy and coming to\
know God, not an event\
4:22\
or ritualistic "giving up" of\
things for the Lord.\
4:26\
The Lord said, "I desire charity\
and not sacrifice; and\
4:29\
the knowledge of God more than\
burnt offerings." The Lord wants\
4:34\
us to become holy, to be possessed\
of charity, and to come\
4:38\
to know Him.\
4:39\
As the Apostle Paul taught, "And\
though I bestow all\
4:42\
my goods to feed the poor, and\
though I give my body\
4:45\
to be burned, and have not\
charity, it profited me nothing."\
4:50\
Ultimately, the Lord wants our\
hearts; He wants us to become new\
4:53\
creatures in Christ.\
4:55\
As He instructed the Nephites, "Ye\
shall offer for\
4:58\
a sacrifice unto me a broken heart\
and a contrite spirit."\
5:03\
Sacrifice is less about giving up\
and more about giving to\
5:07\
the Lord.\
5:08\
Engraved upon the entrance to each\
of our temples are\
5:11\
the words "Holiness to the Lord,\
the House of the Lord." As\
5:15\
we observe our covenant by\
sacrifice, we are made holy\
5:19\
through the grace of Jesus Christ;\
and at the altars of\
5:22\
the holy temple, with broken\
hearts and contrite\
5:25\
spirits, we give our holiness to\
the Lord.\
5:30\
Elder Neal A.\
Maxwell taught: “The submission of\
5:31\
one’s will [or heart] is\
really the only uniquely personal\
5:35\
thing we have to place on God's\
altar.\
5:38\
However, when you and I finally\
submit ourselves by letting our\
5:41\
individual wills be swallowed up\
in God's will, then we are really\
5:46\
giving something to Him." When our\
sacrifices on behalf of\
5:51\
others are viewed from the\
perspective of "giving\
5:53\
up," we may see them as a burden\
and become discouraged when our\
5:58\
sacrifices are not recognized or\
rewarded.\
6:01\
However, when viewed from the\
perspective of "giving to"\
6:05\
the Lord, our sacrifices on behalf\
of others become\
6:08\
gifts, and the joy of generously\
giving becomes its own reward.\
6:14\
Freed from the need for love,\
approval, or appreciation\
6:17\
from others, our sacrifice has\
become the purest and deepest\
6:22\
expressions of our gratitude and\
love for the Savior and our\
6:26\
fellow men.\
6:28\
Any prideful sense of\
self-sacrifice gives way to\
6:31\
feelings of gratitude, generosity,\
contentment,\
6:36\
and joy.\
6:37\
Something is made holy-whether it\
be our lives, our\
6:40\
possessions, our time, or our\
talents- not simply by giving it\
6:44\
up but rather by consecrating it\
to the Lord.\
6:49\
The humanitarian work of the\
Church is such a gift.\
6:52\
It is the product of the\
collective consecrated\
6:55\
offerings of the Saints, a\
manifestation of our love\
6:59\
for God and His children.\
7:02\
Steve and Anita Canfield are\
representative of Latter-day\
7:05\
Saints throughout the world who\
have experienced for themselves\
7:08\
the transformative blessings of\
giving to the Lord.\
7:12\
As welfare and self-reliance\
missionaries, the Canfields were\
7:14\
asked to provide aid at refugee\
camps and immigrant centers\
7:17\
across Europe.\
7:19\
In her professional life, Sister\
Canfield had been a world-class\
7:22\
interior designer contracted by\
wealthy clients to beautify their\
7:26\
luxury homes.\
7:28\
Suddenly, she found herself thrust\
into a world that was\
7:31\
the complete opposite, as she\
served among people who had lost\
7:35\
nearly everything in terms of\
earthly possessions.\
7:39\
In her words, she exchanged marble\
walkways for dirt\
7:43\
floors, and in doing so, she found\
an immeasurable degree of\
7:46\
fulfillment, as she and her\
husband began to befriend-\
7:50\
and soon to love and embrace-those\
who needed\
7:53\
their care.\
7:54\
The Canfields observed: "We did\
not feel as though we had given\
7:58\
up anything to serve the Lord.\
8:00\
Our desire was simply to give to\
Him our time and energies to\
8:04\
bless His children in whatever way\
He saw fit to use us.\
8:09\
As we worked alongside our\
brothers and sisters, any outward\
8:12\
appearances- any differences in\
backgrounds\
8:14\
or belongings-dissolved for us,\
and we simply saw one\
8:18\
another's hearts.\
8:20\
There is no degree of career\
success or material gains that\
8:24\
could have equaled the way that\
these experiences serving among\
8:28\
the humblest of God's children\
enriched us." The Canfield's\
8:32\
story and so many others like it\
have helped me appreciate\
8:35\
the lyrics of a simple yet\
profound primary\
8:38\
song: "Give said the little stream\
as it hurried down\
8:42\
the hill; I'm small, I know, but\
wherever I go\
8:46\
the fields grow greener still."\
Yes, each of us is small,\
8:50\
but together, as we hasten to give\
to God and our fellow\
8:53\
men, wherever we go lives are\
enriched and blessed.\
8:58\
The third verse of this song is\
less well known, but concludes\
9:01\
with this loving invitation:\
"Give, then,\
9:04\
as Jesus gives; There is something\
all can give.\
9:08\
Do as the streams and blossoms do:\
For God and others live."\
9:13\
Dear brothers and sisters, as we\
live for God\
9:16\
and others by giving of our means,\
our time, and yes, even of\
9:19\
ourselves, we are leaving the\
world a little\
9:22\
greener, leaving God's children a\
little happier, and in\
9:26\
the process, becoming a little\
holier.\
9:29\
May the Lord bless you richly for\
the sacrifices that you give\
9:33\
to Him so freely.\
9:35\
I testify that God lives.\
9:38\
"Man of Holiness is his name."\
Jesus Christ is His Son, and He\
9:43\
is the giver of all good gifts.\
9:46\
May we, through His grace and the\
observance of our\
9:49\
covenant by sacrifice, be made\
holy and ever give more love\
9:55\
and holiness to the Lord.\
9:58\
In the holy name of Jesus Christ,\
amen.\
