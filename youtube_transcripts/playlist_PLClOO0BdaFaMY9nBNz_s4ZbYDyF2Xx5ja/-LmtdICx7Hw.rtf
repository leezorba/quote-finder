My dear brothers and sisters, for\
two days we have\
0:04\
been well taught by servants of\
the Lord who have sought\
0:08\
diligently to know what He would\
have them say.\
0:14\
We've been given our charge for\
the next six months.\
0:18\
Now, the question is, how will we\
be different because of what we\
0:23\
have heard and felt?\
0:27\
The pandemic has demonstrated how\
quickly life can change at times\
0:32\
from circumstances beyond our\
control.\
0:36\
However, there are many things we\
can control.\
0:41\
We set our own priorities and\
determine how we use our\
0:46\
energy, time, and means.\
0:50\
We decide how we will treat each\
other.\
0:55\
We choose those to whom we will\
turn for truth and guidance.\
1:00\
The voices and pressures of the\
world are engaging\
1:03\
and numerous, but too many voices\
are deceptive, seductive,\
1:11\
and can pull us off the covenant\
path.\
1:15\
To avoid the inevitable heartbreak\
that follows, I plead\
1:20\
with you today to counter the lure\
of the world by making\
1:26\
time for the Lord in your life\
each and every day.\
1:34\
If most of the information you get\
comes from social or other\
1:37\
media, your ability to hear the\
whisperings of the spirit\
1:41\
will be diminished.\
1:45\
You are now also seeking the Lord\
through daily prayer\
1:48\
and gospel study.\
1:51\
You leave yourself vulnerable to\
philosophies that may be\
1:54\
intriguing but are not true.\
2:00\
Even Saints who are otherwise\
faithful can be derailed by\
2:05\
the steady beat of Babylon's band.\
2:11\
My brothers and sisters, I plead\
with you to make time for\
2:14\
the Lord.\
2:16\
Make your own spiritual foundation\
firm and able to stand\
2:20\
the test of time by doing those\
things that allow the Holy Ghost\
2:25\
to be with you always.\
2:30\
Never underestimate the profound\
truth that the Spirit speaks of\
2:35\
things as they really are, and of\
things as they really\
2:39\
will be.\
2:42\
It will show unto you all things\
what you should do.\
2:49\
Nothing invites the Spirit more\
than fixing your focus\
2:52\
on Jesus Christ.\
2:55\
Talk of Christ, rejoice in Christ,\
feast upon the words of\
3:01\
Christ, and press forward with\
steadfastness in Christ.\
3:08\
Make your Sabbath a delight as you\
worship Him, partake of\
3:12\
the sacrament, and keep His day\
holy.\
3:16\
As I emphasized this morning,\
please make time\
3:19\
for the Lord in His holy house.\
3:22\
Nothing will strengthen your\
spiritual foundation like temple\
3:25\
service and temple worship.\
3:31\
We thank all who are working on\
our new temples.\
3:36\
They're being built all over the\
world.\
3:41\

plans to build more temples\

I love you, dear brothers and\
sisters.\
5:00\
The Lord knows you and loves you.\
5:03\
He is your Savior and your\
Redeemer.\
5:07\
He leads and guides His Church.\
5:12\
He will lead and guide you in your\
personal life if you will\
5:16\
make time for Him in your\
life-each and every day.\
5:24\
May God be with you until we meet\
again, I pray in this sacred name\
5:30\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
