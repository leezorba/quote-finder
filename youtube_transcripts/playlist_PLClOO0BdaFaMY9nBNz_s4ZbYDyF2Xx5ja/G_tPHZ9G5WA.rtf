As a young boy, I had great\
aspirations.\
0:04\
One day after school, I asked,\
"Mom, what should I be\
0:09\
when I grow up?\
0:11\
A professional basketball player,\
or a rock star?"\
0:16\
Unfortunately, Clark the toothless\
wonder showed no\
0:20\
signs of future athletic or\
musical glory.\
0:25\
And despite multiple efforts, I\
was repeatedly denied\
0:29\
admission to my school's advanced\
academic program.\
0:33\
My teacher suggested I should just\
stick to the standard classroom.\
0:39\
Over time, I developed\
compensating study\
0:42\
habits, but it wasn't until my\
mission to Japan that I felt my\
0:47\
intellectual and spiritual\
possibilities begin to emerge.\
0:52\
I continued to work hard, but for\
the first time in my\
0:56\
life, I systematically involve the\
Lord in my development.\
1:02\
And it made all the difference.\
1:05\
Brothers and sisters, in this\
Church, we believe in the divine\
1:11\
potential of all of God's children\
and in our ability to\
1:16\
become something more in Christ.\
1:19\
In the Lord's timing, it is not\
where we start, but where we are\
1:24\
headed, that matters most.\
1:28\
To demonstrate this principle, I\
will draw on some\
1:31\
basic math.\
1:33\
Now, don't panic at hearing the\
word math in general conference.\
1:37\
Our BYU Idaho math faculty assure\
me that even the beginner will\
1:41\
grasp this central concept.\
1:45\
It starts with the formula for a\
line.\
1:49\
The intercept for our purposes is\
the beginning of our line.\
1:54\
The Intercept can have either a\
high or a low starting point.\
2:00\
The slope of the line can then be\
positively or negatively inclined.\
2:06\
We all have different intercepts\
in life.\
2:09\
We start in different places with\
different life endowments.\
2:13\
Some are born with high intercepts\
full of opportunity.\
2:18\
Others face beginning\
circumstances that are\
2:21\
challenging and seem unfair.\
2:25\
We then progress along a slope of\
personal progress.\
2:30\
Our future will be determined far\
less by our starting\
2:34\
point, and much more by our slope.\
2:39\
Jesus Christ sees divine potential\
no matter where we start.\
2:44\
He saw it in the beggar, the\
sinner, the infirm.\
2:49\
He saw it in the fishermen, the\
tax\
2:52\
collector, and even the zealot.\
2:56\
No matter where we start, Christ\
considers what we do with what we\
3:01\
are given.\
3:03\
While the world focuses on our\
intercept,\
3:06\
God focuses on our\
slope.\
3:10\
In the Lord's calculus, He will do\
everything He can to help us\
3:15\
turn our slopes toward heaven.\
3:20\
This principle should give comfort\
to those who\
3:22\
struggle, and pause to those who\
seem to have every advantage.\
3:29\
Let me start by addressing\
individuals with difficult\
3:32\
starting circumstances, including\
poverty, access to\
3:37\
education, and challenging family\
situations.\
3:43\
Others face physical challenges;\
mental health\
3:46\
constraints or strong genetic\
predispositions.\
3:51\
For any struggling with difficult\
starting points, please recognize\
3:57\
that the Savior knows our\
struggles.\
4:00\
He took upon Him our infirmities,\
that His bowels\
4:04\
might be filled with mercy.\
4:07\
That He might know how to sucker\
us according to our infirmities.\
4:14\
Let me share two areas of\
encouragement for those with\
4:17\
difficult starting circumstances.\
4:20\
First, focus on where you are\
headed, not where you began.\
4:25\
It would be wrong to ignore your\
circumstances.\
4:30\
They are real and need to be\
addressed.\
4:33\
But over-focusing on a difficult\
starting point can cause it to\
4:38\
define you and even constrain your\
ability to choose.\
4:43\
Years ago, I served with a group\
of inner-city youth in\
4:46\
Boston, Massachusetts, who were\
largely new to the gospel and to\
4:52\
the expectations of this Church.\
4:56\
It was tempting to confuse my\
empathy and concern for their\
5:00\
situation with the desire to lower\
God's standards.\
5:07\
I eventually realized that the\
most powerful way to show my\
5:11\
love was to never lower my\
expectations.\
5:17\
With everything I knew to do,\
5:20\
we focused together on their\
potential.\
5:26\
And each of them began to elevate\
their slopes.\
5:30\
Their growth in the gospel was\
gradual but steady.\
5:35\
Today they have served missions,\
graduated from\
5:38\
college, married in the temple,\
and are leading\
5:43\
remarkable personal and\
professional lives.\
5:49\
Second, involve the Lord in the\
process of lifting your slope.\
5:55\
While serving as the President of\
BYU Pathway Worldwide,\
5:59\
I remember sitting in a large\
devotional in Lima, Peru, where\
6:04\
elder Carlos A.\
6:05\
Godoy was the speaker.\
6:08\
He looked out over the\
congregation and he seemed\
6:11\
overwhelmed, observing so many\
faithful first generation\
6:17\
university students.\
6:19\
Perhaps reflecting on his own path\
through such difficult\
6:23\
circumstances, Elder Godoy stated\
emotionally, "the Lord will help\
6:29\
you more than you can help\
yourself.\
6:33\
So involve the Lord in this\
process." The Prophet Nephi\
6:38\
taught that "it is by grace we are\
saved, after all we can do."\
6:43\
We must do our best, which\
includes repentance, but it is\
6:46\
only through His grace that we can\
realize our divine potential.\
6:51\
Finally, let me share two areas of\
counsel for those with\
6:55\
elevated starting points.\
6:57\
First, can we show some humility\
for the circumstances we may not\
7:02\
have created ourselves?\
7:05\
As former BYU President Rex E.\
7:07\
Lee quoted to his students, "We\
have all drunk from\
7:11\
wells we did not dig, and warmed\
ourselves by fires we did not\
7:16\
build." He then called on his\
students to give back\
7:21\
and replenish the educational\
wells that\
7:23\
earlier pioneers had\
built.\
7:26\
Failure to receive the fields\
planted by others can be\
7:29\
the equivalent of returning a\
talent without increase.\
7:33\
Second, focusing on a high\
starting point can often trap us\
7:39\
into feeling that we are thriving\
when in fact, our inner slope may\
7:43\
be quite stagnant.\
7:45\
Harvard Professor Clayton M.\
7:47\
Christensen taught that the most\
successful people are\
7:51\
the humblest, because they are\
confident enough to be corrected\
7:56\
and learn from anyone.\
7:58\
Elder D. Todd Christofferson\
8:00\
counseled us\
to â€œwillingly find ways to\
8:03\
accept, and even seek correction,\
even when things\
8:06\
appear to be going well." We must\
seek out opportunities to improve\
8:12\
through prayerful petition.\
8:15\
Regardless of whether we start in\
abundant\
8:17\
or difficult\
circumstances,\
8:21\
realizing our ultimate potential\
will only happen when we make God\
8:26\
our partner.\
8:28\
I recently had a conversation with\
a nationally prominent\
8:31\
educator who was inquiring about\
the success of BYU pathway.\
8:36\
He was bright and his inquiry was\
sincere, but he clearly wanted\
8:40\
a secular response.\
8:43\
I shared with him our retention\
programs and mentoring\
8:46\
efforts, but I concluded by saying\
"these are all good practices.\
8:51\
But the real reason our students\
are progressing is because we\
8:54\
teach them their divine\
potential." Imagine if your whole\
8:59\
life you were told you could never\
succeed.\
9:01\
Then consider the impact of being\
taught that you are an actual son\
9:06\
or daughter of God, with divine\
possibility.\
9:09\
He paused, then replied simply,\
"That's powerful."\
9:14\
Brothers and sisters, one of the\
miracles of this, the Lord's\
9:18\
Church, is that each of us can\
become something more in Christ.\
9:22\
I know of no other organization\
that lifts its members and gives\
9:26\
them more opportunities to serve,\
give back, repent,\
9:29\
and become better people.\
9:31\
When we start in abundant or\
difficult circumstances,\
9:35\
let us keep our sights and\
our slopes pointed heavenward.\
9:40\
As we do, Christ will lift us to a\
higher place.\
9:43\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
