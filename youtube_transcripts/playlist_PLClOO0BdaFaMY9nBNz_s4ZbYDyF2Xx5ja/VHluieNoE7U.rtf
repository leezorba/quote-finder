My dear brothers and sisters,\
during an exercise\
0:04\
stress test, the heart's workload\
is increased.\
0:08\
Hearts that can handle walking may\
struggle to support\
0:12\
the demands of running uphill.\
0:14\
In this way, the stress test can\
reveal underlying disease that's\
0:18\
not otherwise apparent.\
0:20\
Any issues identified can be\
treated before they become\
0:24\
serious problems in daily life.\
0:28\
The COVID-19 pandemic\
0:30\
has certainly been\
a global stress test.\
0:34\
The test has shown mixed results.\
0:37\
Safe and effective vaccines have\
been developed.\
0:40\
Medical professionals, teachers,\
caregivers, and others\
0:43\
have sacrificed heroically and\
continue to do so.\
0:48\
Many people have displayed\
generosity and kindness\
0:53\
and continue to do so.\
0:56\
Yet underlying disadvantages have\
been manifest.\
1:01\
Vulnerable individuals have\
suffered and continue to do so.\
1:07\
Those who work to address these\
underlying inequalities are to be\
1:11\
encouraged and thanked.\
1:14\
The pandemic is also a spiritual\
stress test for the Savior's\
1:18\
Church and its members.\
1:20\
The results are likewise mixed.\
1:24\
Our lives have been blessed by\
ministering in a higher\
1:27\
and holier way.\
1:29\
The "Come, Follow Me" curriculum\
and home-centered,\
1:31\
church-supported gospel learning.\
1:34\
Many have provided compassionate\
help and comfort during these\
1:38\
difficult times and continue to do\
so.\
1:43\
Yet in some instances the\
spiritual stress test has\
1:48\
shown tendencies toward contention\
and divisiveness.\
1:53\
This suggests that we have work to\
do to change our hearts\
1:57\
and to become unified as the\
Savior's true disciples.\
2:02\
This isn't a new challenge, but it\
is a critical one.\
2:07\
When the Savior visited the\
Nephites, He taught: "There\
2:10\
shall be no disputations among\
you.\
2:12\
...\
2:13\
He that hath the spirit of\
contention is not of me, but is\
2:17\
of the devil, who is the father of\
contention, and he stirreth up\
2:22\
the hearts of men to contend with\
anger, one with another." When we\
2:27\
contend with anger against each\
other, Satan laughs and the God\
2:35\
of heaven weeps.\
2:38\
Satan laughs and God weeps for at\
least two reasons.\
2:42\
First, contention weakens our\
collective witness to the world\
2:46\
of Jesus Christ and the redemption\
that comes through\
2:49\
his merits, mercy, and grace.\
2:52\
The Savior said: "A new\
commandment I give unto\
2:54\
you, That ye love one another.\
2:57\
By this shall all men know that ye\
are my disciples, if ye have\
3:02\
love one to another." The converse\
is also true.\
3:07\
Everyone knows that we're not His\
disciples when we don't show love\
3:11\
one to another.\
3:13\
His latter-day work is compromised\
when contention\
3:16\
or enmity exists among His\
disciples.\
3:20\
Second, contention is spiritually\
unhealthy for us as individuals.\
3:25\
We're robbed of peace, joy, and\
rest, and our ability to\
3:30\
feel the Spirit is compromised.\
3:33\
Jesus explained that His doctrine\
was not to stir up the hearts of\
3:37\
men with anger one against another\
but that His doctrine is\
3:41\
that "such things should be done\
away." If I'm quick to take\
3:46\
offense or respond to differences\
of opinion by becoming angry\
3:50\
or judgmental, I fail the\
spiritual stress test.\
3:56\
This failed test doesn't mean that\
I am hopeless.\
3:59\
Rather, it points out that I need\
to change.\
4:03\
And that's good to know.\
4:06\
After the Savior's visit to the\
Americas, the people were unified.\
4:10\
There was no contention in all the\
land.\
4:13\
Do you think that the people were\
unified because they were all\
4:17\
the same or because they had no\
differences of opinion?\
4:23\
I doubt it.\
4:25\
Instead, contention and enmity\
disappeared because they placed\
4:30\
their discipleship of the Savior\
above all else.\
4:34\
Their differences paled in\
comparison to their shared love\
4:37\
of the Savior,\
4:38\
and they were united as heirs\
to the kingdom of God.\
4:43\
The result was that "there could\
not be a happier people...\
4:46\
who had been created by the hand\
of God." Unity requires effort.\
4:52\
It develops when we cultivate the\
love of God in our hearts\
4:56\
and we focus on our eternal\
destiny.\
4:59\
We're united by our common primary\
identity as children of\
5:03\
God and our commitment to the\
truths of the restored gospel.\
5:08\
In turn, our love of God and our\
discipleship of Jesus Christ\
5:12\
generate genuine concern for\
others.\
5:16\
We value the kaleidoscope of\
others' characteristics,\
5:19\
perspectives, and talents.\
5:21\
If we're unable to place our\
discipleship of Jesus Christ\
5:25\
above personal interests and\
viewpoints, we should\
5:28\
reexamine our priorities and\
change.\
5:33\
We might be inclined to say, "Of\
course we can have\
5:37\
unity, if only you would agree\
with me."\
5:42\
A better approach is to ask, "What\
can I do to foster unity?\
5:49\
How can I respond to help this\
person draw closer to Christ?\
5:54\
What can I do to lessen contention\
and to build\
5:58\
a compassionate and caring church\
community?\
6:01\
When love of Christ envelops our\
lives, we approach disagreements\
6:06\
with meekness, patience, and\
kindness.\
6:10\
We worry less about our own\
sensitivities\
6:12\
and more about our\
neighbors'.\
6:14\
We seek to moderate and unify.\
6:16\
We don't engage in doubtful\
disputations, judge those with\
6:20\
whom we disagree, or try to cause\
them to stumble.\
6:23\
Instead, we assume that those with\
whom we disagree are doing\
6:29\
the best they can with the life\
experiences they have.\
6:34\
My wife practiced law for over 20\
years.\
6:38\
As an attorney, she often worked\
with others who explicitly\
6:41\
advocated opposing views.\
6:44\
But she learned to disagree\
without being rude or angry.\
6:48\
She might say to opposing counsel,\
"I can see we're not\
6:52\
going to agree on this issue.\
6:55\
I like you.\
6:57\
I respect your opinion.\
6:59\
I hope you can offer me the same\
courtesy.\
7:04\
Often, this allowed for mutual\
respect and even friendship\
7:09\
despite differences.\
7:11\
Even former enemies can become\
united in their discipleship of\
7:15\
the Savior.\
7:17\
In 2006, I attended the dedication\
of the Helsinki\
7:20\
Finland Temple to honor my father\
and grandparents, who'd been\
7:25\
early converts to the Church in\
Finland.\
7:29\
Finns, including my father, had\
dreamed of a temple\
7:32\
in Finland for decades.\
7:35\
At the time, the temple district\
would encompass Finland,\
7:38\
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,\
Belarus, and Russia.\
7:44\
At the dedication, I learned\
something surprising.\
7:48\
The first day of general operation\
had been set aside\
7:53\
for Russian members to perform\
temple ordinances.\
7:58\
It's difficult to explain just how\
astonishing this was.\
8:03\
Russia and Finland had fought many\
wars over the centuries.\
8:07\
My father distrusted and disliked\
not only Russia\
8:12\
but all Russians.\
8:14\
He'd express such feelings\
passionately, and his feelings\
8:18\
were typical of Finnish enmity\
toward Russia.\
8:22\
He had memorized epic poems that\
chronicled 19th-century warfare\
8:26\
between Finns and Russians.\
8:29\
His experiences during World War\
II, when Finland and Russia were\
8:33\
again antagonists, did nothing to\
change his opinion.\
8:39\
A year before the dedication of\
the Helsinki Finland\
8:42\
Temple, the temple committee,\
consisting exclusively\
8:47\
of Finnish members, met to discuss\
plans for\
8:50\
the dedication.\
8:52\
During the meeting, someone\
observed that Russian Saints\
8:56\
would be traveling several days to\
attend the dedication\
8:59\
and might hope to receive their\
temple blessings\
9:02\
before returning home.\
9:05\
The committee chairman, Brother\
Sven Eklund, suggested that\
9:09\
the Finns could wait a little\
longer, that Russians could be\
9:13\
the first members to perform\
temple ordinances in the temple.\
9:19\
All committee members agreed.\
9:22\
Faithful Latter-day Saint Finns\
delayed their temple blessings to\
9:29\
accommodate Russian Saints.\
9:33\
The Area President who was present\
at that temple committee\
9:36\
meeting, Elder Dennis B.\
9:37\
Neuenschwander, later wrote, "I\
have never been prouder\
9:43\
of the Finns than I was at this\
moment." Finland's difficult\
9:49\
history with its eastern neighbor\
and their excitement of finally\
9:53\
having a temple constructed on\
their own soil were put aside.\
9:59\
Permitting the Russians to enter\
the temple first was a statement\
10:03\
of love and sacrifice.\
10:07\
When I reported this kindness to\
my father, his heart melted.\
10:13\
And he wept.\
10:15\
A very rare occurrence for that\
stoic Finn.\
10:20\
From that time until his death\
three years later, he never\
10:24\
expressed another negative\
sentiment about Russia.\
10:28\
Inspired by the example of his\
fellow Finns, my father chose to\
10:33\
place his discipleship of\
Jesus Christ\
10:36\
above all other\
considerations.\
10:39\
The Finns were no less Finnish.\
10:42\
The Russians were no less Russian.\
10:45\
Neither group abandoned their\
culture, history, or experiences\
10:48\
to banish enmity.\
10:50\
They didn't need to.\
10:52\
Instead, they chose to make their\
discipleship of Jesus Christ\
10:57\
their primary consideration.\
11:00\
If they can do it, so can we.\
11:04\
We can bring our heritage,\
culture,\
11:06\
and experiences to the Church of\
Jesus Christ.\
11:09\
Samuel didn't shy away from his\
heritage as a Lamanite, nor did\
11:13\
Mormon shy away from his as a\
Nephite, but each put his\
11:16\
discipleship of the Savior first.\
11:20\
If we're not one, we're not His.\
11:23\
My invitation is to be valiant in\
putting our love of God\
11:28\
and discipleship of the Savior\
above all other considerations.\
11:33\
Let's uphold the covenant inherent\
in our\
11:35\
discipleship: the covenant to be\
one.\
11:40\
Let's follow the example of Saints\
from around the world who\
11:44\
are successfully becoming\
disciples of Christ.\
11:49\
We can rely on Jesus Christ, who\
is our peace, who\
11:54\
"hath broken down the middle wall\
of partition between us; having\
12:00\
abolished in his [atoning\
sacrifice] the enmity."\
12:07\
Our witness of Jesus Christ to the\
world will be\
12:11\
strengthened, and we will remain\
spiritually healthy.\
12:17\
I testify that as we shun\
contention and become like-minded\
12:23\
with the Lord in love and united\
with Him in faith, His peace will\
12:30\
be ours.\
12:32\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
