This cookie is made of phyllo\
dough and pistachio nuts,\
0:04\
and it's a thank you.\
0:05\
It was made by the Kadado family,\
who for decades owned\
0:09\
three bakeries in Damascus, Syria.\
0:11\
When war came and blockades\
stopped the supplies from\
0:14\
reaching their part of the city,\
they began to starve.\
0:17\
At the height of this desperate\
situation, Latter-day Saint\
0:20\
Charities and some very courageous\
staff at Rahma\
0:23\
Worldwide began serving a hot meal\
every day, along with milk\
0:27\
for the little children.\
0:29\
After a difficult time, this\
family left and began their life-\
0:32\
as well as their bakery once\
again-in a new country.\
0:36\
Recently, a box of cookies arrived\
at the Church Office\
0:39\
Building with the following\
message: "For more than two\
0:42\
months, we managed to get food\
from … Rahma–Latter-day Saint\
0:45\
[Charities]' kitchen.\
0:47\
Without it, we would [have]\
starve[d] to death.\
0:49\
Please accept this … sample from\
my shop as a\
0:52\
small token of\
thanks.\
0:53\
I ask God the Almighty to bless\
you … in everything you do." A\
0:57\
cookie of gratitude and\
remembrance, and it's meant\
1:00\
for you.\
1:02\
To all who prayed after watching a\
story on the news, to all who\
1:06\
volunteered when it wasn't\
convenient or who kindly donated\
1:09\
money to the Humanitarian Fund,\
trusting it would do some\
1:12\
good: Thank you.\
1:16\
The Church of Jesus Christ is\
under divine mandate to care\
1:18\
for the poor.\
1:19\
It's one of the pillars of the\
work of salvation\
1:22\
and exaltation.\
1:23\
So what was true during Alma's day\
is certainly true for\
1:27\
us: "And thus, in their prosperous\
circumstances, they\
1:30\
did not send away any who were\
naked, or that were\
1:33\
hungry, or that were athirst, or\
that were\
1:35\
sick, or that had not been\
nourished; and they did not set\
1:38\
their hearts upon riches;\
therefore they were liberal to\
1:42\
all, both old and young, both bond\
and free, both male\
1:46\
and female, whether out of the\
church or in the\
1:48\
church, having no respect as to\
persons who stood in need." The\
1:54\
Church responds to this charge in\
a wide variety of ways, including\
1:59\
the ministering we do through\
Relief Society, priesthood\
2:02\
quorums, and classes; fasting and\
the use of fast\
2:05\
offerings; welfare farms and\
canneries; welcome centers\
2:09\
for immigrants; outreach for\
people in prison; Church\
2:14\
humanitarian efforts; and the\
JustServe app, where it's\
2:17\
available, that matches volunteers\
with service opportunities.\
2:21\
These are all ways, organized\
through the priesthood, where\
2:25\
small efforts collectively make a\
big impact and magnify\
2:29\
the many individual things that we\
do as disciples of Jesus Christ.\
2:35\
Prophets have charge for the whole\
earth, not just\
2:38\
for members of the Church, and I\
can report from my\
2:40\
own experience how devotedly and\
personally the First\
2:44\
Presidency takes that charge.\
2:46\
As needs grow, the First\
Presidency has charged us to\
2:49\
increase our humanitarian outreach\
in a significant way.\
2:54\
They are interested in the largest\
trends and\
2:56\
the smallest details.\
2:58\
Recently, we brought to them one\
of the protective medical gowns\
3:02\
that Beehive Clothing had sewed\
for hospitals to use during\
3:05\
the pandemic.\
3:06\
As a medical doctor, President\
Nelson was highly interested.\
3:09\
He didn't just want to see it.\
3:11\
He wanted to try it on- check the\
cuffs and the length and\
3:14\
the way it tied in the back.\
3:17\
He told us later, with emotion in\
his voice, "When you meet with\
3:20\
the people on your assignments,\
thank them\
3:22\
for their fasting, for their\
offerings, and for their\
3:25\
ministering in the name of the\
Lord." At President Nelson's\
3:29\
direction, I'm reporting back to\
you about how The Church of Jesus\
3:33\
Christ of Latter-day Saints is\
responding to hurricanes,\
3:37\
earthquakes, refugee displacement,\
and a\
3:39\
pandemic, thanks to the kindness\
of the Latter-Day Saints\
3:43\
and many friends.\
3:45\
While the more than 1500 COVID-19\
projects are certainly\
3:49\
the largest focus of the Church's\
relief over\
3:52\
the last 18 months, the Church\
also responded to 933 natural\
3:57\
disasters and refugee crises in\
108 countries.\
4:02\
But statistics don't tell the\
whole story.\
4:04\
Let me share four brief examples\
to just illustrate the smallest\
4:08\
taste of what's being done.\
4:11\
Sixteen-year-old Dieke Mphuti of\
Welkom, South Africa, lost her\
4:15\
parents years ago, leaving her to\
care for three younger siblings\
4:19\
on her own.\
4:20\
It was always daunting for her to\
find enough food, but COVID\
4:23\
shortages and quarantine made it\
practically impossible.\
4:27\
They were often hungry and\
scraping by only with\
4:30\
the generosity of their neighbors.\
4:32\
On a sunny day in August 2020,\
Dieke was surprised by\
4:36\
a knock at her door.\
4:37\
She opened it to find two\
strangers, one a Church\
4:41\
representative from the area\
office in Johannesburg, and\
4:44\
the other an official from South\
Africa’s\
4:46\
Department of Social\
Development.\
4:48\
These two organizations had teamed\
up to bring food to\
4:52\
at-risk households, and relief\
washed over Dieke as she glimpsed\
4:57\
the pile of cornmeal and the other\
food staples that had\
5:00\
been purchased with Church\
humanitarian funds.\
5:02\
These would help her sustain her\
family for several weeks until\
5:06\
a government aid package could\
take effect for her.\
5:10\
Dieke's story is one of thousands\
of experiences taking place\
5:13\
across the world during the COVID\
pandemic thanks to your\
5:17\
consecrated contributions.\
5:20\
We've all seen recent images in\
the news- thousands of evacuees\
5:23\
being flown from Afghanistan.\
5:26\
Many arrived at Air Force bases or\
other temporary locations in\
5:29\
Qatar, the United States, Germany,\
and Spain before\
5:33\
continuing on to their final\
destinations.\
5:35\
Their needs were immediate, and\
the Church\
5:38\
responded with supplies and\
volunteers.\
5:41\
At Ramstein Air Force Base in\
Germany, the Church provided\
5:44\
large donations of diapers, baby\
formula,\
5:47\
food, and shoes.\
5:49\
Some of the Relief Society sisters\
noticed that many of\
5:51\
the Afghan women were using their\
husbands' shirts to cover their\
5:55\
heads because their traditional\
head coverings had been ripped\
5:58\
off in the frenzy at the Kabul\
airport.\
6:01\
In an act of friendship that\
crossed any religious\
6:04\
or cultural boundaries, the\
sisters of the Ramstein First\
6:07\
Ward gathered together and sewed\
traditional Muslim clothing\
6:11\
for these Afghan women.\
6:13\
Sister Bethani Halls said, "We\
heard [the] women were\
6:16\
in need of prayer garments, and\
we're sewing\
6:18\
so that they can be [comfortable]\
for prayer." This next example\
6:23\
shows you don't have to be wealthy\
or older to be\
6:26\
an instrument for good.\
6:27\
Eighteen-year-old Marie "Djadjou"\
Jacque is from the Cavaillon\
6:31\
Branch in Haiti.\
6:32\
When the devastating earthquake\
struck near her town in\
6:35\
August, her family’s house was one\
of tens of thousands\
6:38\
that collapsed.\
6:39\
It's almost impossible to imagine\
the despair of losing your home.\
6:44\
But rather than giving in to that\
despair, Djadjou,\
6:47\
incredibly, turned outward.\
6:49\
She saw an elderly neighbor\
struggling,\
6:51\
and she began to take\
care of her.\
6:53\
She helped others clear away\
debris.\
6:55\
Despite her exhaustion, she joined\
other Church members to\
6:58\
distribute food and hygiene kits.\
7:01\
Djadjou's story is just one of\
many powerful examples of service\
7:05\
carried out by youth and young\
adults as they strive to follow\
7:09\
the example of Jesus Christ.\
7:11\
Only a few weeks before the\
earthquake, another group of\
7:14\
young adults was giving similar\
service across the Atlantic.\
7:18\
The floods that swept through\
Western Europe in July were\
7:21\
the most severe in decades.\
7:23\
When waters finally receded, one\
shopkeeper in\
7:26\
the riverside town of Ahrweiler,\
Germany, surveyed\
7:29\
the damage and was just\
overwhelmed.\
7:32\
This humble man, a devout\
Catholic, whispered a prayer to\
7:36\
God that somebody might come and\
help him.\
7:40\
The next morning, President Dan\
Hammon of the Germany Frankfurt\
7:42\
Mission arrived on the street with\
a small band of missionaries\
7:46\
wearing yellow Helpings Hands\
vests.\
7:48\
The water had reached up 10 feet\
on the shopkeeper's\
7:51\
walls, and it left behind a deep\
layer of mud.\
7:55\
These volunteers shoveled out the\
mud, removed the carpet\
7:58\
and the drywall, and piled\
everything in the street so it\
8:01\
could be removed.\
8:02\
The overjoyed shopkeeper worked\
alongside them for hours, amazed\
8:06\
that the Lord had sent a group of\
His servants to answer his prayer\
8:10\
within 24 hours.\
8:12\
Speaking of the Church’s\
humanitarian efforts,\
8:14\
Elder Jeffrey R.\
8:15\
Holland once remarked: "Prayers\
are answered … most of the time …\
8:19\
by God using other people.\
8:21\
Well, I pray He'll use us.\
8:23\
I pray that we'll be the answer to\
other people's prayers."\
8:27\
Brothers and sisters, through your\
ministry, donations,\
8:30\
time, and love, you have been the\
answer to so many prayers.\
8:35\
And yet there's so much more to\
do.\
8:38\
As baptized members of the Church,\
we're under covenant\
8:41\
to care for those in need.\
8:42\
Our individual efforts don't\
necessarily require money\
8:45\
or faraway locations, but they do\
require the guidance of the Holy\
8:49\
Spirit and a willing heart to say\
to the Lord, as Elder Ballard\
8:53\
just taught, "Here am I.\
8:55\
Send me." Luke 4 records that\
Jesus "came to Nazareth, where he\
9:00\
had been brought up," and He stood\
up in the synagogue to read.\
9:03\
This was near the beginning of His\
mortal ministry, and He\
9:05\
quoted a passage from the book of\
Isaiah: "The Spirit of the Lord\
9:10\
is upon me, because he hath\
anointed me to preach the gospel\
9:13\
to the poor; he hath sent me to\
heal the brokenhearted, to preach\
9:18\
deliverance to the captives, and\
recovering of sight\
9:20\
to the blind, to set at liberty\
them that are bruised, to preach\
9:25\
the acceptable year of the Lord.\
9:26\
… This day is [the] scripture\
fulfilled in your ears."\
9:31\
I testify that this scripture is\
being fulfilled in our own time\
9:36\
as well.\
9:37\
I testify Jesus Christ is come to\
heal the brokenhearted.\
9:41\
His gospel is to recover sight to\
the blind.\
9:45\
His Church is to preach\
deliverance to the\
9:47\
captives, and His disciples across\
the world are striving to\
9:51\
set at liberty them that are\
bruised.\
9:54\
Let me conclude by repeating the\
question that Jesus asked his\
9:57\
apostle, Simon Peter- and we've\
just heard about this: "Do you\
10:01\
love me?" The essence of the\
gospel is contained in how we\
10:06\
answer that question for\
ourselves.\
10:09\
With great reverence and love for\
Jesus Christ our\
10:11\
Master, I invite each of us to be\
a part of His magnificent\
10:15\
ministry, and "I pray He'll use\
us." In the sacred name of Jesus\
10:20\
Christ, amen.\
