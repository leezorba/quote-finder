My dear brothers and sisters, I am\
grateful to be with\
0:05\
you this morning to share the\
feelings of my heart.\
0:10\
As you know, we are performing\
major renovations on\
0:14\
the historic Salt Lake Temple.\
0:18\
This complex project includes\
major reinforcement of its\
0:24\
original foundation, which has\
served well for more than\
0:29\
a century.\
0:31\
But this temple must stand much\
longer.\
0:37\
In late May, I inspected the\
progress on this massive project.\
0:45\
I thought you would appreciate\
seeing what my wife,\
0:48\
Wendy, and I saw.\
0:51\
I think you will see why the hymn\
"How Firm a Foundation"\
0:57\
has come to have new meaning for\
us.\
1:14\
[MUSIC PLAYING] We are looking at\
the original foundation of\
1:18\
the Salt Lake Temple.\
1:20\
I'm standing in an area beneath\
what was the garden room.\
1:26\
As I examine the craftsmanship of\
this entire building, I marvel at\
1:33\
what the pioneers accomplished.\
1:35\
I am totally in awe when I\
consider that they built this\
1:39\
magnificent temple with only tools\
and techniques available to\
1:44\
them more than a century ago.\
1:47\
These many decades later, however,\
if we examine\
1:51\
the foundation closely, we can see\
the effects of\
1:55\
erosion, gaps in the original\
stonework, and varying stages of\
2:01\
stability in the masonry.\
2:03\
Now as I witness what modern\
engineers, architects,\
2:08\
and construction experts can do to\
reinforce that original\
2:15\
foundation, I am absolutely\
amazed.\
2:19\
Their work is astonishing.\
2:21\
The foundation of any building,\
particularly one\
2:24\
as large as this one, must be\
strong and resilient enough to\
2:30\
withstand earthquakes, corrosion,\
high winds, and\
2:35\
the inevitable settling that\
affects all buildings.\
2:41\
The complex task of strengthening\
now underway will reinforce this\
2:48\
sacred temple with a foundation\
that can and will stand the test\
2:54\
of time.\
3:01\
We are sparing no effort to give\
this venerable temple, which had\
3:08\
become increasingly vulnerable, a\
foundation that\
3:12\
will withstand the forces of\
nature into the Millennium.\
3:20\
In like manner, it is now time\
that we each implement\
3:24\
extraordinary measures, perhaps\
measures we have never taken\
3:30\
before, to strengthen our personal\
spiritual foundations.\
3:38\
Unprecedented times call for\
unprecedented measures.\
3:46\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
these are the latter days.\
3:51\
If you and I are to withstand the\
forthcoming perils\
3:55\
and pressures, it is imperative\
that we each have a firm\
4:02\
spiritual foundation built upon\
the rock of our Redeemer.\
4:08\
Jesus Christ.\
4:11\
So I ask each of you, How firm is\
your foundation?\
4:18\
And what reinforcements to your\
testimony and understanding of\
4:23\
the gospel are needed?\
4:29\
The temple lies at the center of\
strengthening our faith\
4:33\
and spiritual fortitude, because\
the Savior and His\
4:39\
doctrine are the very heart of the\
temple.\
4:45\
Everything taught in the temple,\
through instruction\
4:49\
and through the Spirit, increases\
our understanding of Jesus Christ.\
4:57\
His essential ordinances bind us\
to Him\
5:00\
through sacred priesthood\
covenants.\
5:05\
Then as we keep our covenants, He\
endows us with His\
5:10\
healing, strengthening power.\
5:14\
And, oh, how we will need His\
power in the days ahead.\
5:24\
We have been promised that if we\
are prepared, we shall not fear.\
5:28\
This assurance has profound\
implications today.\
5:34\
The Lord has declared that despite\
today's unprecedented\
5:38\
challenges, those who build their\
foundations upon Jesus Christ\
5:44\
and have learned how to draw upon\
His power need not succumb to\
5:51\
the unique anxieties of this era.\
5:57\
Temple ordinances and covenants\
are ancient.\
6:01\
The Lord instructed Adam and Eve\
to pray, make covenants,\
6:08\
and offer sacrifices.\
6:12\
Indeed, whenever the Lord has had\
a people on the earth who will\
6:16\
obey His word, they have been\
commanded to build temples.\
6:24\
The standard works are replete\
with references to temple\
6:28\
teachings, clothing, language, and\
more.\
6:35\
Everything we believe and every\
promise God has made to His\
6:39\
covenant people come together in\
the temple.\
6:46\
In every age, the temple has\
underscored the precious truth\
6:52\
that those who make covenants with\
God and keep them are\
6:58\
children of the covenant.\
7:02\
Thus, in the house of the Lord we\
can make the same covenants with\
7:06\
God that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob\
made.\
7:11\
And we can receive the same\
blessings.\
7:16\
Temples have been part of this\
dispensation\
7:19\
from its earliest days.\
7:22\
Elijah committed the keys of\
sealing authority to Joseph Smith\
7:27\
in the Kirtland Temple.\
7:30\
The fulness of the priesthood was\
restored in the Nauvoo Temple.\
7:36\
Until his martyrdom, Joseph Smith\
continued to receive revelations\
7:41\
that furthered the restoration of\
the endowment\
7:46\
and sealing ordinances.\
7:50\
He recognized, however, that\
further refinement was needed.\
7:55\
After administering the endowment\
to Brigham Young in\
7:58\
May 1842, Joseph told Brigham,\
8:06\
"This is not arranged right, but\
we have done the best\
8:09\
we could under the circumstances\
in which we are placed, and\
8:14\
I wish you to take this matter in\
hand and organize\
8:18\
and systematize all these\
ceremonies." Close quote.\
8:26\
Well, following the Prophet's\
death, President Young oversaw\
8:30\
the completion of the Nauvoo\
Temple and later built temples in\
8:34\
the Utah territory.\
8:38\
At the dedication of the lower\
stories of the St.\
8:40\
George temple, Brigham Young\
vigorously declared the urgency\
8:46\
of vicarious temple work when he\
said, "When I think upon this\
8:53\
subject, I want the tongues of\
seven thunders to wake up\
8:57\
the people."\
9:02\
From that time forward, temple\
ordinances were gradually refined.\
9:09\
President Harold B.\
9:10\
Lee explained why procedures,\
policies, and even\
9:15\
the administration of temple\
ordinances continue to change\
9:21\
within the Savior's restored\
Church.\
9:26\
President Lee said, "The\
principles of the gospel of Jesus\
9:31\
Christ are divine.\
9:33\
Nobody changes the principles and\
doctrine of the Church except\
9:38\
the Lord by revelation.\
9:41\
But methods change as the inspired\
direction comes to\
9:46\
those who preside at a given time.\
9:50\
Close quote.\
9:53\
Well, consider how administering\
the sacrament has changed over\
9:58\
the years.\
10:00\
In earlier days, the water of the\
sacrament was offered to\
10:03\
the congregation in one large\
vessel.\
10:06\
Everyone drank from it.\
10:10\
Now we use individual disposable\
cups.\
10:15\
The procedure changed, but the\
covenants remain the same.\
10:23\
Ponder these three truths: One,\
the Restoration is\
10:31\
a process, not an event, and will\
continue until the Lord\
10:37\
comes again.\
10:40\
Two: the ultimate objective of the\
gathering of Israel is to\
10:46\
bring the blessings of the temple\
to God's faithful children.\
10:53\
And three:\
10:56\
as we seek how to accomplish that\
objective more\
10:59\
effectively, the Lord reveals more\
insights.\
11:06\
The ongoing Restoration needs\
ongoing revelation.\
11:15\
The First Presidency and Quorum of\
the Twelve Apostles have often\
11:18\
asked the Lord if there are better\
ways to take\
11:22\
the blessings of the temple to His\
faithful children.\
11:27\
We seek guidance regularly on how\
to ensure worldwide\
11:33\
accuracy and consistency of temple\
instruction,\
11:37\
covenants, and ordinances, despite\
differences\
11:42\
in language and culture.\
11:46\
Under the Lord's direction and in\
answer to our\
11:49\
prayers, recent procedural\
adjustments have been made.\
11:56\
He is the one who wants you to\
understand with great clarity\
12:01\
exactly what you are making\
covenants to do.\
12:06\
He is the one who wants you to\
experience fully\
12:09\
His sacred ordinances.\
12:14\
He wants you to comprehend your\
privileges, promises,\
12:19\
and responsibilities.\
12:23\
He wants you to have spiritual\
insights and awakenings you've\
12:29\
never had before.\
12:31\
This He desires for all temple\
patrons,\
12:34\
no matter where they live.\
12:38\
Current adjustments in temple\
procedures and others that will\
12:42\
follow are continuing evidence\
that the Lord is actively\
12:47\
directing His Church.\
12:50\
He is providing opportunities for\
each of us to bolster our\
12:55\
spiritual foundations more\
effectively by centering our\
13:00\
lives on Him and on the ordinances\
and covenants of\
13:06\
His temple.\
13:10\
When you bring your temple\
recommend, a contrite\
13:14\
heart, and a seeking mind to the\
Lord's house of\
13:18\
learning, He will teach you.\
13:25\
Should distance, health\
challenges, or other constraints\
13:29\
prohibit your temple attendance\
for a season, I invite you to set\
13:34\
a regular time to rehearse in your\
mind the covenants you have made.\
13:41\
If you don't yet love to attend\
the temple, go more\
13:46\
often, not less.\
13:49\
Let the Lord, through His Spirit,\
teach and inspire you there.\
13:55\
I promise you that over time the\
temple will become a place of\
14:01\
safety, solace, and revelation.\
14:09\
If it were possible for me to\
speak one on one with every young\
14:14\
adult, I would plead with you to\
seek a companion with whom you\
14:18\
can be sealed in the temple.\
14:24\
You may wonder what difference\
this will make in your life.\
14:28\
I promise it will make all the\
difference.\
14:33\
As you marry in the temple and\
return repeatedly, you will\
14:38\
be strengthened and guided in your\
decisions.\
14:44\
If I could speak with each husband\
and wife who have still\
14:48\
not been sealed in the temple, I\
would plead with you to\
14:52\
take the necessary steps to\
receive that crowning,\
14:55\
life-saving ordinance.\
15:00\
Will it make a difference?\
15:03\
Only if you want to progress\
forever and be together forever.\
15:10\
Wishing to be together forever\
will not make it so.\
15:16\
No other ceremony or contract will\
make it so.\
15:23\
If I could speak to each man or\
woman who longs for marriage\
15:28\
but has not yet found their\
eternal companion, I would urge\
15:33\
you not to wait until marriage to\
be endowed in the house of\
15:36\
the Lord.\
15:39\
Begin now to learn and experience\
what it means to\
15:43\
be armed with priesthood power.\
15:49\
And to each of you who has made\
temple covenants, I plead with\
15:54\
you to seek, prayerfully and\
consistently, to understand\
16:01\
temple covenants and ordinances.\
16:05\
Spiritual doors will open.\
16:08\
You will learn how to part the\
veil between heaven\
16:10\
and earth, how to ask for God's\
angels to attend you, and how\
16:17\
better to receive direction from\
heaven.\
16:23\
Your diligent efforts to do so\
will reinforce and strengthen\
16:27\
your spiritual foundation.\
16:33\
My dear brothers and sisters, when\
renovations on\
16:38\
the Salt Lake Temple are\
completed, there will be no safer\
16:43\
place during an earthquake in the\
Salt Lake Valley than inside\
16:47\
that temple.\
16:51\
Likewise, whenever any kind of\
upheaval occurs in your\
16:57\
life, the safest place to be\
spiritually is living inside your\
17:05\
temple covenants.\
17:09\
Please believe me when I say that\
when your spiritual foundation is\
17:14\
built solidly upon Jesus Christ,\
you have no need to fear.\
17:23\
As you are true to your covenants\
made in the temple, you will be\
17:28\
strengthened by His power.\
17:34\
Then when spiritual earthquakes\
occur, you will be able to stand\
17:39\
strong because your spiritual\
foundation is solid\
17:43\
and immovable.\
17:50\
I love you, dear brothers and\
sisters.\
17:54\
These truths I know.\
17:57\
God, our Heavenly Father wants you\
to choose to come home to Him.\
18:04\
His plan of eternal progression is\
not complicated.\
18:09\
And it honors your agency.\
18:12\
You are free to choose who you\
will be and with whom you will be\
18:21\
in the world to come.\
18:24\
God lives.\
18:26\
Jesus is the Christ.\
18:29\
This is His Church,\
18:31\
restored to help you fulfill\
your divine destiny.\
18:38\
I so testify in the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
18:43\
Amen.\
