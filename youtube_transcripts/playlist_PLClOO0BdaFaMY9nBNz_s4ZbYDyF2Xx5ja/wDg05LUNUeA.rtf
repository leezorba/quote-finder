Shortly after I was called to\
serve as a General Authority\
0:05\
Seventy, I had the opportunity to\
visit with President Russell M.\
0:09\
Nelson for a few minutes.\
0:11\
It was an unplanned encounter in\
the cafeteria and he was so kind\
0:15\
to invite Elder S.\
0:16\
Mark Palmer and me to sit and\
enjoy lunch with him.\
0:21\
"What do we talk about during\
lunch with the Prophet?" was\
0:24\
the thought that came to my mind.\
0:26\
So, I decided to ask President\
Nelson if he had any counsel\
0:30\
and guidance for me since I was\
just starting my calling.\
0:34\
His answer was very simple and\
direct.\
0:37\
He looked at me and said, "Elder\
Schmeil, you are called for what\
0:41\
you can become." I walked away\
from that experience pondering\
0:46\
about what the Lord wants me to\
become.\
0:49\
As I thought about this, I\
realized that He wants me to\
0:52\
become a better husband, father,\
and son, and a better servant.\
0:57\
I then realized that all of this\
could be accomplished as I work\
1:01\
to become a better disciple of the\
Savior, Jesus Christ.\
1:05\
Last general conference, President\
Nelson said, "To do\
1:09\
anything well requires effort.\
1:11\
Becoming a true disciple of Jesus\
Christ is no exception."\
1:16\
President Nelson is inviting us to\
work hard to become a better\
1:20\
disciple of Jesus Christ.\
1:22\
He told us that to become more\
like the Savior, we need to\
1:26\
strengthen our faith by asking,\
acting, and\
1:29\
studying, among other things.\
1:33\
He said, and I quote, "Ask your\
Heavenly Father in the name of\
1:37\
Jesus Christ for help." Asking\
through prayer is one of\
1:42\
the keys to know how to become a\
better disciple of Jesus Christ.\
1:47\
Towards the end of His ministry\
among the Nephites in\
1:49\
the Americas, Jesus Christ\
ascended into heaven.\
1:53\
Later, His disciples gathered\
together, united in mighty prayer\
1:58\
and fasting, and Jesus showed\
Himself unto them, for they were\
2:03\
praying to the Father in His name.\
2:06\
Why did Jesus show Himself again\
to His disciples?\
2:10\
Because they were praying.\
2:11\
They were asking.\
2:13\
Then, he continued, "Now I go unto\
the Father.\
2:17\
And verily I say to you,\
whatsoever things ye shall ask\
2:21\
the Father in my name shall be\
given unto you.\
2:25\
Therefore, ask, and ye shall\
receive; knock, and it shall be\
2:29\
opened unto you; for he that\
asketh, receiveth; and unto him\
2:33\
that knocketh, it shall be\
opened." We need to ask\
2:37\
and faith to know the will of the\
Lord and accept that\
2:42\
the Lord knows what is better for\
us.\
2:45\
Acting is another essential key to\
becoming a better disciple of\
2:49\
Jesus Christ.\
2:51\
As we act, He will guide and\
direct us along the way.\
2:55\
I am sure Nephi was seeking\
guidance from the Lord to know\
2:58\
how to get the brass plates from\
Laban; yet, he and his brothers\
3:03\
tried twice without success.\
3:06\
But they were acting, and the Lord\
was directing them along\
3:10\
the way.\
3:12\
Finally, Nephi was successful the\
third time.\
3:15\
He recalled, "I was led by the\
Spirit, not knowing\
3:19\
beforehand the things which I\
should do." This is how\
3:23\
the Lord works as we put forth\
effort and act even when we do\
3:28\
not have a clear understanding of\
what needs to be done.\
3:32\
The Lord told Nephi what to do.\
3:34\
Go and get the plates.\
3:36\
But He did not tell Nephi how to\
do it.\
3:39\
He left it to Nephi to figure out\
and seek the Lord's help.\
3:44\
And this is often how the Lord\
works in our lives.\
3:47\
As we act in faith, the Lord\
guides and directs us.\
3:53\
In third Nephi, the disciples\
mentioned to the Savior that\
3:56\
there were disputation among the\
people regarding the name of\
3:59\
the Church.\
4:01\
In response, the Savior taught an\
important principle when He\
4:05\
asked, "Have they not read the\
scriptures?" Studying\
4:09\
is, then, another essential key to\
become a better disciple of\
4:12\
Jesus Christ.\
4:14\
Prayer and scripture study go hand\
in hand.\
4:18\
They work together for our\
benefit.\
4:21\
This is the process that the Lord\
has established.\
4:24\
"Feast upon the words of Christ;\
for behold, the words of\
4:28\
Christ will tell you all things\
what ye should do." The Saviour\
4:32\
also taught that we should not\
only study the\
4:34\
scriptures, but also teach from\
them, as he demonstrated to\
4:39\
the Nephites.\
4:40\
"And now it came to pass that when\
Jesus had expounded all\
4:44\
the scriptures in one, which they\
had written, he commanded them\
4:49\
that they should teach the things\
which he had expounded\
4:52\
unto them." This is one of the\
reasons why it was\
4:55\
so important for Nephi to go back\
and get the brass plates.\
4:59\
His family needed the scriptures,\
not only to help\
5:03\
them journey to the promised land,\
but also to help them teach\
5:07\
their children.\
5:09\
We too must seek guidance from the\
scriptures for our\
5:11\
journey, and we must teach from\
them in our homes\
5:15\
and Church callings.\
5:18\
Many times answers to prayers will\
not come right away, but we\
5:23\
must have faith to continue acting\
in righteousness and be\
5:27\
persistent like Nephi when he was\
trying to get the brass plates.\
5:31\
The Lord will show us a little bit\
at a time.\
5:34\
As we study the scriptures, the\
Lord will give us\
5:37\
the answers or the necessary\
strength for us to get through\
5:42\
one more day, one more week, and\
try one more time.\
5:47\
Elder Richard G. Scott said,\
5:49\
“Be thankful that\
sometimes God lets you struggle\
5:53\
for a long time before answers\
come.\
5:56\
That causes your faith to increase\
and your character to\
5:59\
grow." Through prayer and\
scripture study, the Lord has\
6:04\
always given me the strength to\
act and endure one more\
6:08\
day, one more week, and try one\
more time.\
6:12\
Many times the answers did not\
come right away.\
6:15\
I have questions that have not\
been answered yet, but I keep\
6:19\
asking and studying, and I'm happy\
that the Lord continues to\
6:23\
give me the strength to act as I\
wait for answers.\
6:28\
Elder Richard G. Scott also said,\
6:31\
“As you walk to\
the boundary of your\
6:33\
understanding into the twilight of\
uncertainty, exercising\
6:38\
faith, you will be led to find\
solutions you would not obtain\
6:43\
otherwise." To become a better\
follower of the Savior Jesus\
6:47\
Christ is a lifelong journey, and\
we are all in\
6:50\
different stages, moving at a\
different pace.\
6:54\
We must keep in mind that this is\
not a competition, and we are\
6:58\
here to love and help each other.\
7:02\
We need to be acting in order to\
allow the Savior to work with us\
7:06\
in our lives.\
7:08\
Speaking to Sidney Rigdon, the\
Lord said\
7:10\
the following: "I have looked upon\
thee and thy works.\
7:16\
I have heard thy prayers and\
prepared thee for a greater\
7:19\
work." I testify that the Lord\
hears and answers our prayers.\
7:25\
He knows us.\
7:27\
He has a great work for each one\
of us.\
7:30\
Through prayer, scripture, study,\
and\
7:33\
action, we can unlock the\
blessings of heaven\
7:37\
and become a better follower of\
the Savior, Jesus Christ.\
7:42\
President Dallin H.\
7:43\
Oaks taught that, "The Final\
Judgment is not just\
7:47\
an evaluation of a sum total of\
good and evil acts -\
7:51\
what we have done.\
7:52\
It is an acknowledgement of the\
final effect of our acts\
7:56\
and thoughts-what we have become."\
I am grateful\
8:01\
for prophets, seers, and\
revelators.\
8:03\
They are the watchmen on the\
tower.\
8:05\
They see things that we do not\
see.\
8:08\
I testify that through their\
words, we can become better\
8:11\
followers of the Savior, Jesus\
Christ, and achieve our potential.\
8:16\
I testify that Christ lives and\
knows each one of us individually.\
8:20\
This is His Church.\
8:22\
In the sacred name of Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
