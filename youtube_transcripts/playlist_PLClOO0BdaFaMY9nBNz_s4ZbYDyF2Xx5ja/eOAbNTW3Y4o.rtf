While on a flight to Peru a few\
years ago, I was seated next to\
0:06\
a self-proclaimed atheist.\
0:09\
He asked me why I believe in God.\
0:12\
In the delightful conversation\
that ensued, I told him that\
0:17\
I believe in God because Joseph\
Smith saw Him.\
0:21\
And then I added that my knowledge\
of God also came from\
0:24\
personal, real spiritual\
experience.\
0:29\
I shared my belief that "all\
things denote there is a God"\
0:34\
and asked him how he believed the\
earth, this oasis of life in\
0:38\
the vacuum of space, came into\
existence.\
0:42\
He replied that, in his words,\
"the accident" could have\
0:45\
happened over eons of time.\
0:48\
When I explained how highly\
improbable it would be for\
0:52\
an "accident" to produce such\
beauty and order, he was quiet\
0:57\
for a time and then good naturedly\
said, "You got me."\
1:03\
I asked if he would read the Book\
of Mormon.\
1:05\
He said he would, so I sent him a\
copy.\
1:09\
Years later, I made a new friend\
while in an airport in\
1:12\
Lagos, Nigeria.\
1:14\
We became acquainted as he checked\
my passport.\
1:17\
I asked him about his religious\
beliefs, and he expressed strong\
1:21\
faith in God.\
1:22\
I shared the joy and vibrancy of\
the restored gospel of Jesus\
1:26\
Christ and asked if he would like\
to learn more from\
1:29\
the missionaries.\
1:31\
He said yes, was taught, and was\
baptized.\
1:36\
A year or two later, as I walked\
through the airport in\
1:39\
Liberia, I heard a voice call out\
my name.\
1:42\
I turned, and that same young man\
approached with a big smile.\
1:47\
We joyfully embraced, and he let\
me know that he was active in\
1:51\
church and working with the\
missionaries\
1:52\
to teach his girlfriend.\
1:56\
Now, I do not know whether my\
atheist friend ever read\
1:59\
the Book of Mormon or joined the\
Church.\
2:01\
My second friend did.\
2:04\
For both of them, my\
responsibility, my\
2:08\
opportunity, was the same: hold up\
the gospel light to\
2:14\
love, share, and invite each of\
them in a normal, natural way.\
2:20\
Brothers and sisters, I have\
experienced the blessings of\
2:24\
sharing the gospel, and they are\
remarkable.\
2:28\
Here are a few of them.\
2:31\
Sharing the gospel brings joy and\
hope.\
2:35\
You see, you and I know that we\
lived as children of our Heavenly\
2:39\
Father before coming to this earth\
and that the earth was\
2:43\
created for the purpose of giving\
each person the opportunity to\
2:47\
obtain a body, gain experience,\
learn, and grow in\
2:51\
order to receive eternal life,\
which is God's life.\
2:56\
Heavenly Father knew we would\
suffer and sin on earth, so He\
3:00\
sent His Son, whose matchless life\
and infinite atoning\
3:06\
sacrifice make it possible for us\
to be forgiven,\
3:11\
healed, and made whole.\
3:14\
To know these truths is\
life-changing.\
3:18\
When a person learns the glorious\
purpose of\
3:21\
life, comes to understand that\
Christ forgives and succors those\
3:26\
who follow Him, and then chooses\
to follow Christ into the waters\
3:31\
of baptism, life changes for the\
better, even when\
3:35\
the external circumstances of life\
do not.\
3:39\
A radiantly happy sister I met in\
Onitsha, Nigeria, told me that\
3:44\
from the time she learned the\
gospel and was\
3:47\
baptized, and now I use her words,\
"Everything is good\
3:50\
for me.\
3:52\
I am happy.\
3:54\
I am in heaven."\
3:56\
Sharing the gospel kindles joy and\
hope in the souls of both\
4:01\
giver and receiver.\
4:03\
Truly, "how great shall be your\
joy" as you share the gospel.\
4:10\
Sharing the gospel is joy upon\
joy, hope upon hope.\
4:16\
Sharing the gospel brings God's\
power into our lives.\
4:22\
When we were baptized, each of us\
entered into a perpetual covenant\
4:26\
with God to "serve him and keep\
his commandments," which includes\
4:32\
"to stand as [a witness] of [Him]\
at all times and in all\
4:36\
things, and in all places." As we\
"abide in" Him by keeping this\
4:42\
covenant, the enlivening,\
sustaining, sanctifying power of\
4:49\
godliness flows into our lives\
from Christ, just like a branch\
4:55\
receives nourishment from the\
vine.\
4:59\
Sharing the gospel protects us\
from temptation.\
5:04\
The Lord commands: "Hold up your\
light that it may shine unto\
5:09\
the world.\
5:11\
Behold I am the light which ye\
shall hold up\
5:13\
that which ye have seen me do.\
5:15\
… I have commanded...\
5:17\
that ye should come unto me, that\
ye might feel and\
5:19\
see; even so shall ye do unto the\
world; and whosoever breaketh\
5:26\
this commandment sufferereth\
himself to be led into\
5:30\
temptation." Choosing to not hold\
up the gospel light moves us to\
5:36\
the shadows, where we are\
susceptible to temptation.\
5:41\
Importantly, the converse is true.\
5:45\
Choosing to hold up the gospel\
light brings us more fully into\
5:49\
that light and the protection it\
provides against temptation.\
5:54\
What a tremendous blessing in\
today's world.\
6:00\
Sharing the gospel brings healing.\
6:03\
Sister Tiffany Myloan accepted the\
invitation to support\
6:08\
the missionaries despite very\
heavy personal struggles,\
6:14\
including questions about her\
faith.\
6:17\
She recently told me that\
supporting the missionaries has\
6:20\
renewed her faith and sense of\
well-being.\
6:24\
In her words, "Missionary work is\
so healing." Joy.\
6:33\
Hope.\
6:35\
Sustaining power from God.\
6:38\
Protection from temptation.\
6:40\
Healing.\
6:42\
All of these and more, including\
forgiveness of sins, distill upon\
6:47\
us from heaven as we share the\
gospel.\
6:52\
Now, turning to our great\
opportunity.\
6:55\
Brothers and sisters, "there are\
many … among all parties,\
7:00\
sects, and denominations...\
7:02\
who are only kept from the truth\
because they know not where to\
7:06\
find it." The need to hold up our\
light has never been greater in\
7:11\
all human history.\
7:13\
And the truth has never been more\
accessible.\
7:16\
Jimmy Ton, who grew up Buddhist,\
was impressed by\
7:20\
a family who shared their life on\
YouTube.\
7:23\
When he learned that they were\
members of The Church of Jesus\
7:26\
Christ of Latter-day Saints, he\
studied the gospel\
7:29\
online by himself, read the Book\
of Mormon using the app, and was\
7:34\
baptized after meeting with the\
missionaries in college.\
7:38\
Elder Ton is now a full-time\
missionary himself.\
7:42\
He and his fellow missionaries\
around the world are "the Lord's\
7:45\
… battalion," to quote our\
prophet.\
7:48\
These missionaries buck the trend\
of the world.\
7:51\
While surveys report that Gen Z is\
turning away from God, our\
7:56\
stripling warrior elders and\
sisters are turning people to God.\
8:02\
And increasing numbers of members\
of the Church are uniting with\
8:05\
the missionaries in sharing the\
gospel, helping more\
8:09\
and more friends to come unto\
Christ and His Church.\
8:13\
Our Latter-day Saints in Liberia\
helped 507 friends enter\
8:18\
the waters of baptism during the\
10 months there were no\
8:22\
full-time missionaries serving in\
their country.\
8:26\
When one of our wonderful stake\
presidents there heard that\
8:30\
the full-time missionaries may be\
returning, he remarked,\
8:34\
"Oh, good.\
8:35\
Now they can help us with our\
work." He is correct.\
8:41\
The gathering of Israel, the\
greatest cause on this earth,\
8:45\
is our covenant responsibility,\
and this is our time.\
8:50\
My invitation today is simple:\
Share the gospel.\
8:56\
Be you and hold up the light.\
9:00\
Pray for heaven's help and follow\
spiritual promptings.\
9:04\
Share your life normally and\
naturally.\
9:07\
Invite another person to come and\
see, to come and\
9:11\
help, and to come and belong.\
9:13\
And then rejoice as you and those\
you love receive\
9:18\
the promised blessings.\
9:21\
I know that in Christ, these good\
tidings are preached to\
9:25\
the meek.\
9:26\
In Christ are the brokenhearted\
bound up.\
9:30\
In Christ is liberty proclaimed to\
the captives.\
9:33\
And in Christ, only in Christ, are\
those who mourn given\
9:37\
beauty for ashes.\
9:42\
Hence the great need to make these\
things known.\
9:47\
I testify that Jesus Christ is the\
Author\
9:50\
and the Finisher of\
our faith.\
9:53\
He will finish.\
9:55\
He will complete our exercise of\
faith, however imperfect, in\
9:59\
holding up the gospel light.\
10:01\
He will work miracles in our lives\
and in the lives of all He\
10:04\
gathers, for He is a God of\
miracles.\
10:08\
In the wondrous name of Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
