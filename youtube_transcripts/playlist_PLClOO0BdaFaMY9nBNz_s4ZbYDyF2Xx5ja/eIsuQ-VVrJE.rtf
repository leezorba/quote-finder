In November 2019, my friend and I\
visited the Holy Land.\
0:08\
While there, we reviewed and\
studied scriptures about\
0:12\
Jesus Christ and His life.\
0:16\
One morning we stood on the\
northwestern shore of\
0:20\
the Sea of Galilee at a place that\
may have been where Jesus\
0:26\
met His disciples following His\
Resurrection.\
0:31\
After Jesus's Resurrection, as we\
read in John\
0:36\
chapter 21, Peter and the other\
disciples fished all night\
0:42\
without success.\
0:44\
In the morning, they saw a man\
standing on the shore who told\
0:50\
them to cast their net on the\
other side of the boat.\
0:55\
To their astonishment, the net was\
filled miraculously.\
1:00\
They immediately recognized that\
the man was the Lord, and they\
1:06\
rushed to greet Him.\
1:09\
As they dragged the net to shore\
full of fish, Jesus said, "Come\
1:16\
and dine." John reports that "when\
they had dined, Jesus saith\
1:23\
to Simon Peter, Simon, son of\
Jonas, lovest thou me more than\
1:31\
these?" While I was standing on\
that same seashore,\
1:37\
I realized that the Savior's\
question was one of the most\
1:42\
important questions that He might\
someday ask me.\
1:47\
I could almost hear His voice\
asking, "Russell, lovest thou me\
1:55\
more than these?" Do you wonder\
what Jesus was referring to when\
2:01\
He asked Peter, "Lovest thou me\
more than these?" Relating this\
2:08\
question to ourselves in our day,\
the Lord may be asking us\
2:13\
about how busy we are and about\
the many positive and negative\
2:18\
influences competing for our\
attention and our time.\
2:24\
He may be asking each of us if we\
love Him more than the things of\
2:31\
this world.\
2:33\
This may be a question about what\
we really value in life, who we\
2:39\
follow, and how we view our\
relationships with family members\
2:44\
and neighbors.\
2:46\
Or maybe He is asking what really\
brings us joy and happiness.\
2:52\
Do the things of this world bring\
us the joy, happiness, and peace\
2:58\
that the Savior offered to His\
disciples, that He offers to us?\
3:05\
Only He can bring us true joy,\
happiness, and peace through\
3:11\
our loving Him and following His\
teachings.\
3:16\
How would we answer the question\
"Lovest thou me more than these?"\
3:23\
When we discover a fuller meaning\
of this question, we can become\
3:29\
better family members, neighbors,\
citizens, members of\
3:35\
the Church, and sons and daughters\
of God.\
3:40\
At my age, I have attended many\
funerals.\
3:45\
I'm sure many of you have noticed\
what I have noticed when\
3:49\
celebrating the life of a deceased\
family member or\
3:53\
a friend.\
3:55\
It's rare for the speaker to talk\
about the size of the person's\
3:59\
home, the number of cars, or the\
bank account balances.\
4:05\
They usually don't speak about\
social media posts.\
4:09\
Most\
4:11\
of the funerals that I've\
attended, they focus on their\
4:17\
loved one's relationships, service\
to\
4:20\
others, life lessons and\
experiences, and their love\
4:27\
for Jesus Christ.\
4:29\
Don't misunderstand me.\
4:32\
I'm not saying that having a nice\
home or a nice car is\
4:36\
wrong or that using social media\
is bad.\
4:41\
What I am saying is that in the\
end, those things matter very\
4:47\
little compared to loving the\
Savior.\
4:52\
When we love and follow Him, we\
have faith in Him.\
4:57\
We repent.\
4:59\
We follow His example\
5:01\
and are baptized and receive\
the Holy Ghost.\
5:06\
We endure to the end and stay on\
the covenant path.\
5:11\
We forgive family members and\
neighbors by letting go of\
5:16\
grudges we may be holding.\
5:20\
We earnestly strive to keep God's\
commandments.\
5:24\
We strive to be obedient.\
5:27\
We make and keep covenants.\
5:29\
We honor our fathers and mothers.\
5:33\
We set aside negative worldly\
influences.\
5:38\
We prepare ourselves for His\
Second Coming.\
5:42\
In "The Living Christ: The\
Testimony of the\
5:45\
Apostles," we read: "[Jesus] will\
someday return to earth.\
5:51\
â€¦ He will rule as King of Kings\
and reign as Lord of\
5:57\
Lords, and every knee shall bend\
and every tongue shall speak in\
6:03\
worship before him.\
6:06\
Each of us will stand to be judged\
of Him according to our\
6:11\
works and â€¦ desires of our\
hearts." As one of the Apostles\
6:17\
who signed the "Living Christ"\
document, I can say that knowing\
6:23\
that Jesus is the light, the life,\
and the hope of\
6:28\
the world gives me greater desire\
to love Him more every day.\
6:36\
I testify that Heavenly Father and\
Jesus Christ live.\
6:41\
I testify that They love us.\
6:44\
The scriptures teach that "God so\
loved the world, that he gave\
6:50\
his only begotten Son, that\
[whoso] believeth in him should\
6:55\
not perish, but have everlasting\
life." The scriptures also teach\
7:04\
that Jesus "so loved the world\
that he gave his own\
7:09\
life, that as many as would\
believe might become the sons\
7:15\
[and daughters] of God." Heavenly\
Father so loved us that He\
7:22\
prepared His plan of salvation,\
with a Savior as\
7:27\
the central figure.\
7:29\
And Jesus so loved us that in the\
Great Council in\
7:34\
Heaven, when Heavenly Father\
asked, "Whom shall I send?"\
7:40\
Jesus, who was the firstborn of\
all of Father's spirit\
7:45\
children, answered, "Here am I,\
send me." He said unto\
7:53\
the Father, "Father, thy will be\
done, and the glory be thine\
7:59\
forever." Jesus volunteered to be\
our Savior and Redeemer so that\
8:07\
we could become like Them and\
return to Their presence.\
8:13\
These two scriptures also teach\
that to return to Their\
8:18\
presence, we need to believe.\
8:22\
We need to believe in Jesus and in\
God's plan of happiness.\
8:28\
To believe is to love and follow\
our Savior and keep\
8:33\
the commandments even in the midst\
of trials and strife.\
8:39\
Today's world is unsettled.\
8:43\
There are disappointments,\
8:44\
disagreements, distress and\
distractions.\
8:49\
President Dallin H.\
8:51\
Oaks, speaking in 2017, noted the\
following: "These are\
8:57\
challenging times filled with big\
worries: wars and rumors of\
9:02\
wars, possible epidemics of\
infectious diseases,\
9:07\
droughts, floods, and global\
warming." (Close quote.) We\
9:12\
cannot lose our love for and hope\
in Jesus, even if we\
9:18\
face seemingly overwhelming\
challenges.\
9:24\
Heavenly Father and Jesus will\
never forget us.\
9:29\
They love us.\
9:31\
Last October, President Russell M.\
9:33\
Nelson taught us the importance of\
putting Heavenly Father\
9:39\
and Jesus Christ first in our\
lives.\
9:43\
President Nelson taught us that\
one meaning of the word "Israel"\
9:49\
is "Let God prevail." He asked\
each of us these questions\
9:57\
(quote), "Are you willing to let\
God prevail in your life?\
10:03\
Are you willing let God be the\
most important influence in\
10:08\
your life?\
10:10\
Will you allow His words, His\
commandments, and His covenants\
10:15\
to influence what you do each day?\
10:20\
Will you allow His voice to take\
priority over any other?\
10:28\
Are you willing to let whatever He\
needs you to do take\
10:33\
precedence over every other\
ambition?\
10:39\
Are you willing to have your will\
swallowed up in\
10:45\
His?" (Close quote.)\
10:48\
We must always remember that our\
true happiness depends upon our\
10:52\
relationship with God, with Jesus\
Christ, and with each other.\
11:00\
One way to demonstrate our love is\
by joining family,\
11:05\
friends, and neighbors in doing\
some small things to better serve\
11:11\
each other.\
11:12\
Do things that make this world a\
better place.\
11:17\
What things can you do within your\
own life to show that you\
11:22\
love the Lord first?\
11:25\
As we focus on loving our\
neighbors as He loves\
11:30\
them, we start to truly love those\
around us.\
11:36\
I ask again, how would you respond\
to the Savior's\
11:40\
question, "Lovest thou me more\
than these?" As you consider this\
11:48\
question, as I have done, I pray\
that you may answer, as Peter did\
11:54\
so long ago, "Yea, Lord; thou\
knowest that I love\
12:00\
thee," and then show it by loving\
and serving God and all those\
12:09\
around you.\
12:12\
I testify that we are blessed to\
have the gospel of Jesus Christ\
12:17\
to guide us in the way we live and\
treat each other.\
12:23\
In Him, we discover that every\
daughter and son of God is\
12:30\
precious to Him.\
12:33\
I testify that Jesus Christ is our\
beloved Savior.\
12:39\
He's the Only Begotten Son of God.\
12:43\
And I bear this testimony humbly\
in the name of Jesus\
12:48\
Christ, amen.\
