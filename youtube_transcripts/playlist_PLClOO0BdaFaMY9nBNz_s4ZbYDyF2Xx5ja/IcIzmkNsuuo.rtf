Our Heavenly Father loves us\
profoundly and perfectly.\
0:06\
In His love, He created a plan, a\
plan of redemption\
0:10\
and happiness, to open to us all\
the opportunities and joys we're\
0:15\
willing to receive, up to and\
including all that He has\
0:19\
and is.\
0:22\
To achieve this, He was even\
willing to offer His Beloved\
0:25\
Son, Jesus Christ, as our\
Redeemer.\
0:30\
"For God so loved the world that\
He gave His only Begotten\
0:34\
Son, that whosoever believeth in\
Him should not perish, but have\
0:39\
everlasting life." His is a\
Father's pure love.\
0:45\
Universal to all, yet personal to\
each.\
0:51\
Jesus Christ shares with the\
Father this same perfect love.\
0:55\
When the Father first elaborated\
His great Plan of\
0:58\
Happiness, He called for one to\
act as a Savior to redeem us-\
1:03\
an essential part of that plan.\
1:07\
Jesus volunteered, "Here am I,\
send me." The Savior, doeth\
1:13\
not anything, save it be for the\
benefit of the world, for He\
1:16\
loveth the world.\
1:18\
Even that He layeth down His own\
life, that He may draw all men\
1:23\
onto Him.\
1:25\
Wherefore He commandeth none that\
they shall not\
1:28\
partake of His salvation."\
1:32\
This divine love should give us\
abundant comfort and confidence\
1:36\
as we pray to the Father in the\
name of Christ.\
1:40\
Not one of us is a stranger to\
them.\
1:44\
We need not hesitate to call upon\
God, even when we feel unworthy.\
1:49\
We can rely on the mercy and\
merits of Jesus Christ\
1:53\
to be heard.\
1:56\
As we abide in God's love, we\
depend less and less\
1:58\
on the approval of others to guide\
us.\
2:02\
Because God's love is\
all-embracing, some speak of it\
2:06\
as unconditional, and in their\
minds, they may project that\
2:10\
thought to mean that God's\
blessings are unconditional\
2:13\
and that salvation is\
unconditional.\
2:17\
They're not.\
2:19\
Some are wont to say "the Savior\
loves me just as I am." And that\
2:23\
is certainly true.\
2:24\
But He cannot take any of us into\
His kingdom just as we are.\
2:30\
For no unclean thing can dwell\
there or dwell in His presence.\
2:35\
Our sins must first be resolved.\
2:38\
Professor Hugh Nibley once noted\
that the kingdom of God cannot\
2:41\
endure if it indulges even the\
smallest sin.\
2:45\
Quote, "the slightest taint of\
corruption means that the other\
2:50\
world would be neither\
incorruptible\
2:52\
nor eternal.\
2:54\
The tiniest flaw in a building,\
institution,\
2:57\
code, or character will inevitably\
prove fatal in\
3:01\
the long run of eternity." End\
quote.\
3:05\
The commandments of God are strict\
because His kingdom\
3:08\
and its citizens can stand only if\
they consistently reject evil\
3:13\
and choose good without exception.\
3:16\
Elder Jeffrey R.\
3:17\
Holland observed, "Jesus clearly\
understood what many in our\
3:21\
modern culture seem to forget:\
that there is a crucial\
3:25\
difference between the commandment\
to forgive\
3:27\
sin, which he had an infinite\
capacity to do, and the warning\
3:32\
against condoning it, which He\
never did, even once." Despite\
3:38\
our present imperfections,\
however, we can\
3:41\
still hope to attain a name and\
standing, a place in His\
3:46\
church and in the Celestial world.\
3:49\
After making it clear that He\
cannot excuse or wink at\
3:52\
sin, the Lord assures us,\
nevertheless, he that represents\
3:57\
and does the commandments of God\
shall be forgiven.\
4:01\
"And as often as my people repent\
will I forgive them their\
4:04\
trespasses against me." Repentance\
and divine grace\
4:09\
resolve the dilemma.\
4:12\
Remember also the words which\
Amulek spake unto Zeezrom in\
4:15\
the city of Ammonihah.\
4:18\
"For he said unto him that the\
Lord surely would come to\
4:20\
redeem His people, but that He\
should not come to redeem them in\
4:24\
their sins, but to redeem them\
from their sins.\
4:29\
And He hath power given unto Him\
from the Father to redeem them\
4:32\
from their sins because of\
repentance.\
4:36\
Therefore, He has sent His angels\
to declare the tidings of\
4:39\
the conditions of repentance,\
which bringeth unto\
4:43\
the power of the Redeemer under\
the salvation of their souls."\
4:47\
With the condition of repentance,\
the Lord can extend\
4:51\
mercy without robbing justice.\
4:54\
And God ceaseth not to be God.\
4:58\
The way of the world, as you know,\
is "anti-Christ,"\
5:01\
or "anything- but-Christ." Our day\
is a replay of Book of Mormon\
5:06\
history, in which charismatic\
figures pursue unrighteous\
5:11\
dominion over others, celebrate\
sexual license, and promote\
5:16\
accumulating wealth as the object\
of our existence.\
5:21\
Their philosophies justify in\
committing a little sin, or even\
5:24\
a lot of sin, but none can offer\
redemption.\
5:28\
That comes only through the blood\
of the Lamb.\
5:32\
The best the "anything-but-\
Christ" or "anything-\
5:35\
but-repentance" crowd can offer is\
the unfounded claim that sin\
5:40\
does not exist.\
5:42\
Or that if it exists, it\
ultimately has no consequences.\
5:48\
I canâ€™t see that argument getting\
much traction\
5:51\
at the final judgment.\
5:54\
We don't have to attempt the\
impossible in trying to\
5:57\
rationalize our sins away.\
6:00\
And on the other hand, we don't\
have to attempt the impossible in\
6:05\
erasing the effects of sin by our\
own merit alone.\
6:09\
Ours is not a religion of\
rationalization, nor a religion\
6:14\
of perfectionism, but a religion\
of redemption.\
6:19\
Redemption through Jesus Christ.\
6:22\
If we're among the penitent with\
His Atonement, our sins are\
6:27\
nailed to His cross and with His\
stripes, we are healed.\
6:35\
I've long been impressed by, and\
I've also felt,\
6:38\
the yearning love of the Prophets\
of God in their\
6:41\
warnings against sin.\
6:43\
They're not motivated by a desire\
to condemn; their true\
6:47\
desire mirrors the love of God.\
6:49\
In fact, it is the love of God.\
6:52\
They love those to whom they're\
sent, whoever and whatever they\
6:56\
may be like.\
6:58\
Just as the Lord, His servants do\
not want anyone to suffer\
7:02\
the pains of sin and poor choices.\
7:05\
Alma was sent to declare the\
message of repentance\
7:08\
and redemption to a hate-filled\
people who were willing to\
7:12\
persecute, torture, even kill\
Christian believers, including\
7:16\
Alma himself.\
7:18\
Yet he loved them and yearned for\
their salvation.\
7:22\
After declaring the atonement of\
Christ to the people of\
7:25\
Ammonihah, Alma pleaded, "And now\
my brother and I wish from\
7:30\
the most part of my heart, yea,\
with great\
7:33\
anxiety, even under pain, that you\
would hearken unto my words\
7:38\
and cast off your sins, that ye\
may be lifted up at the last day\
7:43\
and enter into God's rest."\
7:47\
In President Russell M.\
7:49\
Nelson's words, "it is precisely\
because we do care deeply about\
7:54\
all of God's children that we\
proclaim His truth."\
7:59\
The love of the Father and the Son\
is freely given,\
8:02\
but also includes hope and\
expectations.\
8:07\
Again, quoting President Nelson,\
"God's laws are motivated\
8:11\
entirely by His infinite love for\
us, and His desire for us to\
8:16\
become all we can become." Because\
They love you, They do\
8:20\
not want to leave you just as you\
are.\
8:23\
Because They love you, They want\
you to have joy and success.\
8:27\
Because They love you, They want\
you to repent, because that is\
8:30\
the path to happiness.\
8:32\
But it is your choice.\
8:34\
They honor your agency.\
8:36\
You must choose to love Them, to\
serve Them, to keep\
8:39\
Their commandments.\
8:41\
Then, They can more abundantly\
bless you as well as love you.\
8:49\
Their principal expectation of us\
is that we also love.\
8:54\
"He that loveth not, knoweth not\
God, for God is love." As John\
9:01\
wrote, "If God so loved us, we\
ought also to love one\
9:07\
another." Former Primary General\
President Joy D.\
9:11\
Jones recalled that as a young\
couple, she and her husband were\
9:16\
called to visit and minister to a\
family who hadn't been to\
9:20\
church for many years.\
9:22\
It was immediately clear in their\
first visit they were not wanted.\
9:27\
After the frustration of\
additional failed\
9:30\
attempts, and after much sincere\
prayer and pondering, Brother\
9:35\
and Sister Jones received an\
answer to the 'why' of their\
9:38\
service in this verse from the\
Doctrine and\
9:41\
Covenants: "Thou shalt love the\
Lord thy God with all thy\
9:46\
heart, with all thy might, mind,\
and strength.\
9:50\
And in the name of Jesus Christ,\
thou shalt serve Him."\
9:56\
Sister Jones said, "we realized\
that we were sincerely striving\
9:59\
to serve this family and to serve\
our bishop.\
10:03\
But we had to ask ourselves if we\
were really serving out of love\
10:07\
for the Lord.\
10:09\
We began looking forward to our\
visits with this dear family\
10:12\
because of our love for the Lord.\
10:14\
We were doing it for Him.\
10:16\
He made the struggle no longer a\
struggle.\
10:20\
After many months of our standing\
on the doorstep, the family began\
10:24\
letting us in.\
10:25\
Eventually, we had regular prayer\
10:28\
and tender gospel discussions\
together.\
10:31\
A long-lasting friendship\
developed.\
10:33\
We were worshipping and loving Him\
by loving His children.\
10:39\
In acknowledging that God loves us\
perfectly, we might each\
10:43\
ask, how well do I love God?\
10:48\
Can He rely on my love as I rely\
on His?\
10:54\
Would it not be a worthy\
aspiration to live so that God\
10:58\
can love us, not just in spite of\
our failings, but also\
11:03\
because of what we are becoming?\
11:07\
Oh that He could say of you and me\
as He said of Hyrum\
11:09\
Smith, for example.\
11:11\
"I the Lord love him because of\
the integrity of his heart." Let\
11:18\
us remember John's kind\
admonition: "For this is\
11:22\
the love of God, that we keep His\
commandments.\
11:26\
And His commandments are not\
grievous." And indeed, His\
11:32\
commandments are not grievous.\
11:34\
Just the opposite.\
11:36\
They mark the path of healing,\
happiness,\
11:39\
peace, and joy.\
11:42\
Our Father and Redeemer have\
blessed us with commandments.\
11:47\
And in obeying Their commandments,\
we feel Their\
11:49\
perfect love more fully and more\
profoundly.\
11:57\
Here is the solution for our\
incessantly quarrelsome\
12:01\
times: love of God.\
12:05\
As Elder Holland observed just a\
moment ago, In the golden age\
12:11\
of Book of Mormon history,\
following the Saviors\
12:14\
ministry, it's reported that there\
was no contention in\
12:19\
the land "because of the love of\
God, which did dwell in\
12:23\
the hearts of the people."\
12:26\
As we strive towards Zion,\
remember the promise in\
12:31\
Revelation: "Blessed are they that\
do His commandments,\
12:36\
but they may have right to the\
tree of life and may enter in\
12:40\
through the gate into the holy\
city." I bear witness of\
12:45\
the reality of our Heavenly Father\
and our Redeemer, Jesus\
12:48\
Christ, and of Their constant,\
undying love, in\
12:54\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
