As recorded in the Book of Mormon,\
six years before\
0:06\
the birth of Jesus Christ, Samuel\
the righteous\
0:10\
Lamanite prophesied to the Nephite\
people who, by\
0:14\
then, had become mostly apostate,\
of the signs that would\
0:18\
accompany our Savior's birth.\
0:21\
Tragically, most Nephites rejected\
those signs because "it\
0:25\
was not reasonable that such a\
being as a Christ should come."\
0:31\
Regrettably, according to the\
scriptural record, many of\
0:35\
the Jews in like manner could not\
accept that a man named Jesus\
0:41\
from the little-regarded province\
of Galilee\
0:44\
was the long-awaited\
Messiah.\
0:47\
Jesus, who had indeed come to\
fulfill the many prophecies made\
0:52\
by Hebrew prophets, was rejected\
and even crucified.\
0:57\
Because, as the Book of Mormon\
prophet Jacob taught, the Jews\
1:01\
were looking beyond the mark.\
1:04\
Consequently, Jacob prophesied\
that "God hath taken away his\
1:09\
plainness from them, and delivered\
unto them many things\
1:12\
which they cannot understand\
because they desired it.\
1:17\
And because they desired it God\
hath done it, that they may\
1:20\
stumble." Strange as it may seem,\
no teaching, no\
1:25\
miracle, and no appearance even of\
a heavenly angel as witnessed\
1:30\
by Laman and Lemuel appears to\
have the persuasive power to\
1:34\
convince some individuals to alter\
their course,\
1:38\
outlook, or belief that something\
is true.\
1:42\
This is especially the case when\
teachings or miracles do not\
1:46\
agree with an individual's\
preconceived whims,\
1:50\
wishes, or ideas.\
1:52\
Please contrast for a moment the\
following two scriptures.\
1:57\
The first from the Apostle Paul.\
1:59\
Speaking of the latter days\
describing the ways of man.\
2:03\
and the second from Alma the\
prophet, showing how God does\
2:07\
his work among mankind.\
2:10\
First from Paul.\
2:12\
"This know also, that in the last\
days perilous times\
2:16\
shall come.\
2:18\
For men shall be lovers of their\
own selves, covetous,\
2:21\
boasters, proud blasphemers,\
disobedient to\
2:25\
parents, unthankful, unholy,\
without natural\
2:29\
affection, trucebreakers, false\
accusers, incontinent,\
2:33\
fierce, despisers of those that\
are good, traitors,\
2:38\
heady, highminded, lovers of\
pleasures more than lovers of God.\
2:43\
ever learning, and never able to\
come to the knowledge of\
2:48\
the truth." And now, from Alma\
stating a foundational principle\
2:53\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ,\
"Now ye may suppose that\
2:57\
this is foolishness in me; but\
behold I say unto\
3:01\
you, that by small and simple\
things are great things brought\
3:04\
to pass; and small means in many\
instances does confound\
3:09\
the wise." We live in a modern\
world filled with great knowledge\
3:15\
and much prowess.\
3:17\
Nonetheless, these things too\
often camouflage the unsteady\
3:21\
foundation upon which they are\
built.\
3:24\
Consequently, they do not lead to\
real truth and on toward God\
3:29\
and the power to receive\
revelation, acquire spiritual\
3:32\
knowledge and deeper faith in\
Jesus Christ\
3:36\
that leads to salvation.\
3:39\
We are profoundly reminded of our\
Lord's words to Thomas and\
3:44\
the other apostles on the eve of\
his atoning sacrifice: "Jesus\
3:48\
saith unto him, I am the way, the\
truth, and the\
3:52\
life: no man cometh unto the\
Father, but by me." For those\
3:58\
who have eyes to see, ears to\
hear, and hearts to feel, more\
4:03\
than ever before, we are required\
to confront the reality that we\
4:08\
are getting ever closer to the\
second coming of Jesus Christ.\
4:12\
True, great difficulties yet await\
those on the earth at\
4:16\
His return.\
4:18\
But in this regard, the faithful\
need not fear.\
4:23\
Now I quote for a moment from the\
Church's gospel topics under\
4:27\
the heading: The second coming of\
Jesus Christ.\
4:31\
"When the Savior comes again, He\
will come in power\
4:34\
and glory to claim the earth as\
His kingdom.\
4:38\
His second coming will mark the\
beginning of the millennium.\
4:43\
The second coming will be a\
fearful, mournful time for\
4:46\
the wicked, but it will be a day\
of peace for the righteous." The\
4:52\
Lord declared, "They that are wise\
and have received\
4:56\
the truth, and have taken the Holy\
Spirit for their\
4:59\
guide, and have not been deceived-\
verily I say to\
5:02\
you, they shall not be hewn down\
and cast into the fire,\
5:08\
but shall abide the day and the\
earth shall be given unto\
5:12\
them for an inheritance; and they\
shall multiply and work\
5:16\
strong, and their children shall\
grow up without sin\
5:20\
unto salvation.\
5:22\
For the Lord shall be in their\
midst, and his glory shall be\
5:26\
upon them, and he will be their\
king and their lawgiver." In our\
5:33\
preparation for the second coming\
of Jesus Christ, I provide\
5:37\
a vital, comforting note for the\
faithful taken from the Old\
5:41\
Testament prophet Amos: "Surely\
the Lord God will do\
5:45\
nothing, [until] he revealeth his\
secret unto his servants,\
5:51\
the prophets." In this spirit,\
today's prophet of\
5:55\
the Lord to the world, President\
Russell M.\
5:57\
Nelson, has given us this recent\
inspiring counsel: "The gospel of\
6:03\
Jesus Christ is a gospel of\
repentance.\
6:07\
Because of the Savior's Atonement,\
His gospel provides\
6:10\
an invitation to keep changing,\
growing, and becoming\
6:14\
more pure.\
6:16\
It is a gospel of hope, of\
healing, and of progress.\
6:21\
Thus, the gospel is a message of\
joy.\
6:25\
Our spirits rejoice with every\
small step forward we take."\
6:32\
I unreservedly testify of and\
attest to the reality of God\
6:39\
and the miracles in everyday life\
of countless people from both\
6:44\
the low and high stations of life.\
6:47\
True, many sacred experiences are\
rarely spoken of, in part\
6:52\
because of their divine origin and\
the resulting possibility of\
6:58\
ridicule by some who do not know\
better.\
7:03\
In this regard, the last to the\
Book of Mormon\
7:05\
prophets, Moroni, reminds us, "And\
again, I speak unto you\
7:10\
who deny the revelations of God,\
and say that they are done\
7:15\
away, that there are no\
revelations, no\
7:18\
prophecies, no gifts, nor healing,\
nor speaking with\
7:22\
tongues, and the interpretation of\
tongues; behold, I say unto\
7:28\
you; he that denieth these things\
knoweth not the gospel of\
7:32\
Christ; yea, he has not read the\
scriptures; if so, he does\
7:37\
not understand them.\
7:39\
For do we not read that God is the\
same yesterday,\
7:43\
today, and forever, and in him\
there is no variableness\
7:48\
neither shadow of changing?"\
7:52\
I conclude my remarks with a truly\
inspiring, prophetic\
7:57\
declaration from the prophet\
Joseph Smith, given near the end\
8:02\
of his ministry as he looked\
forward to the second coming of\
8:06\
Jesus Christ.\
8:09\
"Shall we not go on in so great a\
cause?\
8:12\
Go forward and not backward.\
8:15\
Courage, brethren- And may I add\
sisters-and on, on to\
8:22\
the victory!\
8:23\
Let your hearts rejoice and be\
exceedingly glad." To which\
8:30\
I add my witness, in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
