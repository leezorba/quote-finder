Even though our family has enjoyed\
rich blessings while\
0:05\
joyfully walking the covenant\
path, we have also faced\
0:08\
exceedingly high mountains.\
0:10\
I wish to share some very personal\
experiences regarding\
0:13\
mental illness.\
0:15\
These include clinical depression,\
severe\
0:17\
anxiety, bipolar disorder, ADHD,\
and sometimes\
0:21\
a combination of them all.\
0:24\
I share these tender experiences\
0:25\
with the approval of those\
involved.\
0:28\
During my ministry, I have\
encountered hundreds of\
0:30\
individuals and families with\
similar experiences.\
0:34\
Sometimes I wonder if the\
desolating sickness covering\
0:37\
the land, as mentioned in the\
scriptures, might include\
0:40\
mental illness.\
0:42\
It is worldwide, covering every\
continent and culture,\
0:45\
and affecting all-young, old,\
rich, and poor.\
0:49\
Members of the Church have not\
been excluded.\
0:52\
At the same time, our doctrine\
teaches us to strive to become\
0:55\
like Jesus Christ and be perfected\
in Him.\
0:58\
Our children sing, "I'm trying to\
be like Jesus." We long to be\
1:03\
perfect, even as our Heavenly\
Father\
1:05\
and Jesus Christ are\
perfect.\
1:07\
Because mental illness can\
interfere with our perception of\
1:10\
perfection, it remains all too\
often a taboo.\
1:14\
As a result, there is too much\
ignorance,\
1:16\
too much silent\
suffering, and too much despair.\
1:20\
Many feeling overwhelmed because\
they do not meet\
1:23\
perceived standard mistakenly\
believe they have no place in\
1:27\
the Church.\
1:29\
To combat such deception, it is\
important to remember that\
1:33\
the Savior loves each of His\
Father's children.\
1:37\
He fully comprehends the pain and\
struggle that many experience\
1:41\
as they live with a broad range of\
mental health challenges.\
1:46\
He suffered pains and afflictions\
and temptations\
1:49\
of every kind.\
1:50\
Taking upon Him the pains and the\
sickness of His people.\
1:54\
Because He understands all\
afflictions, He knows how to heal\
1:58\
the broken hearted.\
2:00\
Challenges often indicate a need\
for additional tools and support\
2:04\
and are not a character defect.\
2:07\
Allow me to share several\
observations I made as our family\
2:11\
has passed through trials.\
2:13\
First, many people will mourn with\
us; they won't judge us.\
2:18\
Due to severe panic attacks,\
anxiety,\
2:21\
and depression, our son returned\
home from his mission just after\
2:24\
four weeks.\
2:26\
As his parents, we found it\
difficult to deal with\
2:29\
disappointment and sadness because\
we had prayed so much\
2:32\
for his success.\
2:34\
Like all parents, we want our\
children to prosper and be happy.\
2:38\
A mission was to be an important\
milestone for our son.\
2:42\
We also wondered what other people\
might think.\
2:46\
Unbeknownst to us, our son's\
return was infinitely more\
2:49\
devastating for him.\
2:51\
Note that he loved the Lord and\
wanted to serve.\
2:55\
And yet he could not for reasons\
he struggled to understand.\
2:59\
He soon found himself at a point\
of total hopelessness,\
3:02\
battling deep guilt.\
3:03\
He no longer felt accepted, but\
spiritually numb.\
3:07\
He became consumed by recurring\
thoughts of death.\
3:11\
While in this irrational state,\
our son believed that\
3:14\
the only action left was to take\
his own life.\
3:18\
It took the Holy Ghost and a\
legion of angels on both sides\
3:21\
of the veil to save him.\
3:23\
While he was fighting for his life\
and during this immensely\
3:27\
difficult time, our family, ward\
leaders,\
3:30\
members, and friends went out of\
their way to support\
3:34\
and minister to us.\
3:36\
I have never felt such an\
outpouring of love.\
3:39\
I have never sensed more\
powerfully and in such\
3:42\
a personal way what it means to\
comfort those in need of comfort.\
3:47\
Our family will be ever grateful\
for that outpouring.\
3:50\
I cannot describe the countless\
miracles\
3:52\
that accompanied these\
events.\
3:55\
Gratefully, our son survived, but\
it has taken\
3:58\
a long time and much medical,\
therapeutic,\
4:01\
and spiritual care for him to heal\
and to accept that he is\
4:05\
loved, valued, and needed.\
4:08\
I recognize that not all such\
incidents end like ours.\
4:12\
I sorrow with those who have lost\
loved ones far too early and are\
4:17\
now left with feelings of grief as\
well as unanswered questions.\
4:21\
My next observation is that it can\
be difficult for parents to\
4:25\
identify their children's\
struggles.\
4:27\
But we must educate ourselves.\
4:30\
How can we know the difference\
between the difficulties\
4:32\
associated with normal development\
and signs of illness?\
4:37\
As parents, we have the sacred\
charge to help our children\
4:40\
navigate life's challenges.\
4:42\
However, few of us, our mental\
health specialists.\
4:46\
We, nevertheless, need to care for\
our children by helping them\
4:50\
learn to be content with their\
sincere efforts as they strive to\
4:54\
meet appropriate expectations.\
4:56\
Each of us knows from our own\
personal shortcomings that\
5:00\
spiritual growth is an ongoing\
process.\
5:03\
We now understand that there is\
not a simple cure-all\
5:06\
for emotional and mental wellness.\
5:09\
We all experience stress and\
trauma because we live in\
5:12\
a fallen world with a fallen body.\
5:15\
Additionally, many contributing\
factors may lead to a diagnosis\
5:19\
of mental illness.\
5:21\
Regardless of our mental and\
emotional well-being,\
5:23\
focusing on growth is healthier\
5:25\
than obsessing about our\
shortcomings.\
5:28\
For my wife and me, the one thing\
that has always helped us was\
5:32\
staying as close to the Lord as\
possible.\
5:36\
In hindsight, we now see how the\
Lord patiently tutored us\
5:40\
through times of great\
uncertainty.\
5:42\
His light guided us step by step\
to the darkest hours.\
5:47\
The Lord helped us to see what\
that the worth of\
5:50\
an individual's soul is far more\
important in the eternal scheme\
5:54\
than any earthly task or\
achievement.\
5:57\
Again, educating ourselves about\
mental illness prepares us to\
6:01\
help ourselves and others who\
might be struggling.\
6:05\
Open and honest discussion with\
one another will help this\
6:08\
important topic to receive the\
attention it deserves.\
6:12\
After all, information precedes\
inspiration and revelation.\
6:16\
These all too often invisible\
challenges can affect\
6:20\
anyone, and when we are facing\
them, they appear insurmountable.\
6:26\
One of the first things we need to\
learn is that we are certainly\
6:29\
not alone.\
6:30\
I invite you to study the topic of\
mental health and the Life\
6:34\
Help section of the Gospel Library\
app.\
6:36\
Learning will lead to more\
understanding, more\
6:39\
acceptance, more compassion, more\
love.\
6:43\
It can lessen tragedy while\
helping us develop and manage\
6:46\
healthy expectations and healthy\
interactions.\
6:50\
My final observation, we need to\
constantly watch over each other.\
6:55\
We must love one another and be\
less judgmental, especially when\
6:59\
our expectations are not\
immediately met.\
7:02\
We should help our children and\
youth feel the love of Jesus\
7:05\
Christ in their lives, even when\
they struggle to personally feel\
7:09\
love for themselves.\
7:11\
Elder Orson F.\
7:12\
Whitney, who served as a member of\
the Quorum of the Twelve\
7:15\
Apostles, counseled parents how to\
help struggling\
7:19\
offspring: "Pray for your\
children.\
7:22\
Hold onto them with your faith." I\
have often pondered what it\
7:26\
means to hold onto them with\
faith.\
7:29\
I believe it includes simple acts\
of love, meekness,\
7:32\
kindness, and respect.\
7:34\
It means allowing them to develop\
at their own pace, bearing\
7:37\
testimony to help them feel our\
Savior's love.\
7:41\
It requires us to think more about\
them, and less about\
7:44\
ourselves or others.\
7:46\
That usually means speaking less\
and listening much, much more.\
7:50\
We must love them, empower them,\
and praise them often\
7:54\
and their efforts to succeed and\
be faithful to God.\
7:57\
And finally, we should do\
everything in our power to stay\
8:01\
close to them just as we stay\
close to God.\
8:05\
For all who are personally\
affected by mental\
8:07\
illness, hold fast to your\
covenants.\
8:10\
Even if you might not feel God's\
love at this time, do whatever\
8:15\
lies in your power and then stand\
still to see the salvation of\
8:19\
God, for His arm to be revealed.\
8:23\
I testify that Jesus Christ is our\
Savior.\
8:26\
He knows us, He loves us, and He\
will wait on us.\
8:30\
During our family trials, I have\
come to know just how close He is.\
8:34\
His promises are true.\
8:36\
"Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be\
not\
8:39\
dismayed, For I am thy God and I\
will still give thee aid.\
8:43\
I'll strengthen thee, help thee,\
and cause thee to stand.\
8:47\
Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent\
hand." Knowing how\
8:51\
firm our foundation is, may we\
ever joyfully declare, "The soul\
8:56\
that on Jesus has leaned for\
repose I will not, I\
9:00\
cannot, desert to his foes; That\
soul, though all hell\
9:04\
should endeavor to shake.\
9:05\
I'll never, no never, no never\
forsake." In the name of Jesus\
9:11\
Christ, amen.\
