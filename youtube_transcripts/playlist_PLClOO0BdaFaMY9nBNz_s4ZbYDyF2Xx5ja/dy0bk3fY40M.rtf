My brothers and sisters, as I\
stand in our beloved Conference\
0:06\
Center once again, I am reminded\
of the words of the Apostle\
0:10\
Peter, "Lord, It is good for us to\
be here." My thoughts today\
0:17\
are centered on the words of the\
prophet Nephi, who kept\
0:20\
the record of his people following\
father Lehi's death.\
0:24\
Nephi wrote, "And upon these, I\
write the things of my\
0:29\
soul." I used to pass over this\
verse thinking the word "things"\
0:36\
was not very elegant or spiritual,\
not grand enough to\
0:40\
pair with "my soul." Yet I have\
learned that the word things is\
0:46\
used in the scriptures 2,354\
times.\
0:51\
For example, in Moses, "I am the\
Beginning and the\
0:55\
End, the Almighty God, by mine\
Only Begotten I created these\
1:00\
things." And Nephi's words,\
"Behold, my soul\
1:05\
delighteth in the things of the\
Lord; and my heart pondereth\
1:09\
continually upon the things which\
I have seen and heard." Nephi's\
1:16\
words raise the questions: What\
things do you ponder?\
1:21\
What things really matter to you?\
1:24\
What are the things of your soul?\
1:28\
The things of our souls are often\
clarified\
1:31\
and deepened by asking\
questions.\
1:34\
During the pandemic, I have met\
with youth from all over\
1:37\
the world in many devotionals,\
large and\
1:41\
small, through broadcasts and\
social media, and we\
1:45\
discussed their questions.\
1:48\
Fourteen-year-old Joseph Smith had\
a question deep in his\
1:51\
soul, and he took it to the Lord.\
1:55\
President Russell M.\
1:56\
Nelson has emphasized, "Take your\
questions to the Lord and to\
2:01\
other faithful sources.\
2:03\
Study with the desire to believe,\
rather than with\
2:07\
the hope that you can find a flaw\
in the fabric of\
2:10\
a prophet's life or a discrepancy\
in the scriptures.\
2:14\
Stop increasing your doubts by\
rehearsing them with doubters.\
2:19\
Allow the Lord to lead you on your\
journey of spiritual\
2:24\
discovery." Youth often ask me\
what I believe and why\
2:30\
I believe.\
2:31\
I remember visiting virtually with\
one young woman in her home.\
2:36\
I asked if it was the first time\
an apostle had been in her home.\
2:40\
She quickly smiled and responded,\
"Yes." Her\
2:44\
question for me was good.\
2:46\
"What are the most important\
things I should know?"\
2:51\
I answered with the things of my\
soul, the things that prepare me\
2:56\
to hear promptings, that lift my\
sights beyond the ways of\
3:00\
the world, that give purpose to my\
work in the gospel and to my\
3:05\
very life.\
3:07\
May I share with you some of the\
things of my soul?\
3:11\
These things apply to all who seek\
to be true disciples of\
3:15\
Jesus Christ.\
3:16\
Ten would be a good round number.\
3:19\
Today I am giving you seven with\
the hope that you will complete\
3:23\
eight, nine, and ten from your own\
experiences.\
3:27\
First, love God the Father and\
Jesus Christ our Savior.\
3:33\
Jesus decreed the first great\
commandment: "Thou shalt love\
3:37\
the Lord, thy God, with all thy\
heart and with all thy soul\
3:41\
and with all thy mind." President\
Nelson declared his devotion to\
3:46\
God, our Eternal Father, and to\
His Son, Jesus Christ, when he\
3:51\
was called to lead the Lord's\
Church, saying, quote, "I know\
3:55\
Them, love Them, and pledge to\
serve Them and you with every\
4:01\
remaining breath of my life," end\
quote.\
4:06\
So first, love the Father and the\
Son.\
4:09\
Second, love thy neighbor.\
4:12\
That is not just a good idea, it's\
the second great commandment.\
4:16\
Your neighbors are your spouse and\
family, ward members, work\
4:21\
colleagues, roommates, those not\
of our faith, those needing\
4:25\
a helping hand, and, frankly,\
everyone.\
4:29\
The essence of love thy neighbor\
is voiced in the hymn, "Love One\
4:33\
Another." President Nelson reminds\
us, "When we love God\
4:38\
with all our hearts, He turns our\
hearts to the well-being of\
4:43\
others." Third, love yourself.\
4:47\
This is where many struggle.\
4:50\
Isn't it curious that loving\
ourselves seems to come less\
4:54\
easily than loving others?\
4:56\
Yet the Lord has said, "Love thy\
neighbor as thyself." He values\
5:02\
the divinity within us, and so\
must we.\
5:06\
When we are heavy laden with\
mistakes, heartaches, feelings of\
5:10\
inadequacy, disappointment, anger,\
or\
5:13\
sin, the power of the Savior's\
Atonement is, by divine\
5:19\
design, one of the things that\
lifts the soul.\
5:23\
Fourth, keep the commandments.\
5:26\
The Lord has made it clear, "If\
you love me, keep my\
5:29\
commandments." Strive each day to\
be and do a little better and to\
5:34\
press forward in righteousness.\
5:37\
Fifth, always be worthy to attend\
the temple.\
5:41\
I call it being recommended to the\
Lord.\
5:44\
Whether you have access to a\
temple or not, being worthy of\
5:48\
a current temple recommend keeps\
you firmly focused on the things\
5:53\
that matter- the covenant path.\
5:56\
Sixth, be joyful and cheerful.\
6:00\
"Be of good cheer and do not\
fear," the Lord has said.\
6:04\
Why? How?\
6:06\
When challenges face us at every\
turn?\
6:11\
Because of the promise made by\
Jesus Christ.\
6:14\
"I, the Lord, I am with you and\
will stand by you." President\
6:19\
Nelson describes the restored\
gospel as a message of\
6:22\
joy, and he explains, "The joy we\
feel has little to do with\
6:31\
the circumstances of our lives and\
everything to do with\
6:35\
the focus of our lives." Seven.\
6:39\
Follow God's living prophet.\
6:42\
This may be seventh on my list of\
things, but it is at the top of\
6:47\
my mind in terms of its importance\
today.\
6:51\
We have a prophet of God on the\
earth today.\
6:54\
Never discount what that means for\
you.\
6:57\
Remember the young woman I\
mentioned at the beginning?\
7:00\
She wanted to know what things\
mattered most.\
7:03\
"Follow the living prophet," I\
said then and\
7:06\
I emphasize again today.\
7:10\
We are distinguished as a Church\
to be led by prophets,\
7:13\
seers, and revelators called of\
God for this time.\
7:18\
I promise that as you listen and\
follow their counsel, you\
7:22\
will never be led astray.\
7:26\
Never.\
7:28\
We live in a time when we are\
tossed to and fro, when\
7:32\
spirituality, decency, integrity,\
and respect are under attack.\
7:37\
We have to make choices.\
7:39\
We have the voice of the Lord\
through His prophet to calm our\
7:43\
fears and lift our sights for when\
President Nelson\
7:47\
speaks, he speaks for the Lord.\
7:51\
We are blessed with scriptures and\
teachings that remind\
7:54\
us, "My thoughts are not your\
thoughts; neither are your ways\
7:59\
my ways, saith the Lord." So it\
was with Naaman, a great military\
8:05\
leader in Syria, yet a leper, who\
was told that\
8:09\
the prophet Elijah could heal him.\
8:12\
Elijah sent his messenger to tell\
Naaman to wash in the River\
8:17\
Jordan seven times and he would be\
clean.\
8:20\
Naaman scoffed.\
8:22\
Certainly, there was a mightier\
river than the Jordan.\
8:25\
And why send a servant when he\
expected Elijah the prophet to\
8:29\
personally heal him?\
8:32\
Naaman walked away, but eventually\
was persuaded by\
8:36\
his servants.\
8:38\
"If the prophet had bid the do\
some great thing, wouldest thou\
8:42\
not have done it?" Naaman finally\
dipped seven times in the Jordan\
8:48\
and was healed.\
8:50\
The account of Naaman reminds us\
of the risk of picking\
8:54\
and choosing the parts of\
prophetic counsel that fit our\
8:58\
thinking, expectation, or today's\
norms.\
9:03\
Our prophet continually points us\
to our own\
9:06\
river Jordans to be\
healed.\
9:10\
The most important words we can\
hear, ponder, and follow are\
9:14\
those revealed through our living\
prophet.\
9:17\
I bear witness that I have sat in\
council with President Nelson to\
9:21\
discuss weighty matters of the\
Church and of the\
9:24\
world, and I have seen revelation\
flow through him.\
9:30\
He knows the Lord.\
9:31\
He knows His ways, and he desires\
that all of God's children will\
9:36\
hear Him, the Lord Jesus Christ.\
9:40\
For many years, we heard from the\
prophet twice a year at\
9:44\
general conference, but with the\
complex issues of our\
9:47\
day, President Nelson is speaking\
much more often in\
9:51\
forums, social media, devotionals,\
and even press briefings.\
9:57\
I have observed him preparing and\
presenting profound,\
10:02\
revelatory messages that have\
encouraged more\
10:05\
gratitude, promoted greater\
inclusion of all our brothers\
10:09\
and sisters on earth, and\
increased peace,\
10:13\
hope, joy, help, and healing in\
our individual lives.\
10:19\
President Nelson is a gifted\
communicator, but more\
10:22\
importantly, he is a prophet of\
God.\
10:26\
That is staggering when you think\
about it, but it is critical to\
10:30\
realize that his clear direction\
will shield us from all\
10:34\
the deceit, craftiness, and\
secular ways gaining momentum\
10:39\
in the world today.\
10:41\
The prophetic mantle is all about\
revelation.\
10:45\
"The Restoration of the Fullness\
of the Gospel of Jesus\
10:48\
Christ, a Bicentennial\
Proclamation to the World" given\
10:52\
in the April 2020 general\
conference emphasizes that\
10:57\
the Lord is directing this work.\
10:59\
In this proclamation, the First\
Presidency and Quorum of\
11:03\
the Twelve Apostles state, quote,\
"We gladly declare\
11:08\
that the promised restoration goes\
forward\
11:11\
through continuing\
revelation.\
11:14\
The earth will never again be the\
same as God will gather\
11:18\
together in one all things in\
Christ." All things in Christ\
11:25\
and the things of my soul are what\
this Church, this\
11:29\
gospel, and this people are all\
about.\
11:32\
I close with an invitation for\
each of you to consider\
11:36\
the seven things of my soul I have\
shared today.\
11:40\
Love God, the Father and Jesus\
Christ, our Savior.\
11:43\
Love your neighbor.\
11:45\
Love yourself.\
11:46\
Keep the commandments.\
11:48\
Always be worthy of a temple\
recommend.\
11:51\
Be joyful and cheerful.\
11:53\
And follow God's living prophet.\
11:56\
I invite you to identify your own\
eight, nine, and ten.\
12:01\
Consider ways you might share your\
heartfelt things with others\
12:06\
and encourage them to pray,\
ponder, and seek\
12:08\
the Lord's guidance.\
12:10\
The things of my soul are as\
precious to me\
12:13\
as yours are to you.\
12:15\
These things strengthen our\
service in the Church and in all\
12:19\
areas of life.\
12:20\
They commit us to Jesus Christ.\
12:23\
They remind us of our covenants,\
and they help us feel\
12:27\
secure in the arms of the Lord.\
12:29\
I testify that He desires that our\
souls shall never hunger\
12:33\
nor thirst, but shall be filled\
with His love as we seek to\
12:39\
become His true disciples to be\
one with Him as He is with\
12:44\
the Father.\
12:46\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
