We gather this beautiful Sabbath\
morning to speak of\
0:06\
Christ, rejoice in His gospel, and\
support and sustain\
0:11\
one another as we walk in the way\
of our Savior.\
0:16\
As members of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day\
0:19\
Saints, we assemble for this\
purpose every Sabbath day\
0:22\
throughout the year.\
0:24\
If you are not a member of the\
Church, we welcome you most\
0:27\
warmly and thank you for joining\
with us to worship the Savior\
0:33\
and learn of Him.\
0:35\
Like you, we're striving, though\
imperfectly, to become better\
0:41\
friends, neighbors, and human\
beings, and we seek to do this by\
0:45\
following our Exemplar, Jesus\
Christ.\
0:51\
We hope you can feel the sincerity\
of our testimony.\
0:56\
Jesus Christ lives.\
0:58\
He is real.\
1:00\
He is the Son of the living God,\
and He directs prophets\
1:05\
on the earth in our day today as\
He has our dear prophet\
1:10\
and president, Russell M.\
1:12\
Nelson.\
1:13\
We invite all to come, hear the\
word of God, and partake of\
1:18\
His goodness.\
1:20\
I bare my personal witness that\
God is among us and that He will\
1:27\
surely draw near to all who draw\
near to Him.\
1:33\
We consider it an honor to walk\
with you in the Master's strait\
1:38\
and narrow path of discipleship.\
1:41\
Thereâ€™s an oft-repeated theory\
1:44\
that people who are lost walk in\
circles.\
1:47\
Not long ago, scientists of the\
Max Planck Institute\
1:51\
for Biological Cybernetics tested\
that theory.\
1:56\
They took participants to a thick\
forest and gave them\
2:00\
simple instructions: "Walk in a\
straight line." There were no\
2:05\
visible landmarks.\
2:07\
The test subjects had to rely\
2:09\
solely on their sense of\
direction.\
2:12\
How do you think they did?\
2:15\
Well, the scientists concluded,\
people really do walk\
2:19\
in circles when they do not have\
reliable\
2:22\
cues to their walking\
direction.\
2:25\
When questioned afterwards, some\
participants\
2:27\
self-confidently claimed that they\
had not deviated in\
2:32\
the slightest.\
2:33\
Despite their high confidence, GPS\
data showed that\
2:37\
they walked in loops as tight as\
20 meters in diameter.\
2:43\
Why do we have such a hard time\
walking in a straight line?\
2:48\
Some researchers hypothesize that\
small, seemingly insignificant\
2:54\
deviations in terrain make the\
difference.\
2:56\
Others have pointed to the fact\
that we all have one leg that is\
3:00\
slightly stronger than the other.\
3:03\
More likely, however, we struggle\
to walk straight ahead\
3:10\
because of increasing uncertainty\
about where straight ahead is.\
3:19\
Whatever the cause, it is human\
nature: without reliable\
3:23\
landmarks, we drift off course.\
3:26\
Isn't it interesting how small,\
seemingly insignificant\
3:30\
factors can make a major\
difference in our lives?\
3:34\
I know this from personal\
experience as a pilot.\
3:37\
Every time I started the approach\
to an\
3:39\
airport, I knew that much of my\
remaining work would consist of\
3:45\
making constant minor course\
corrections to safely direct\
3:50\
the aircraft to our desired\
landing runway.\
3:54\
You may have similar experience\
when driving a vehicle, when road\
3:59\
irregularities, imperfect wheel\
alignment,\
4:02\
inattentiveness, not to mention\
the actions of other\
4:06\
drivers, all can push you off your\
intended path.\
4:13\
Fail to pay attention to these\
factors and you may end up having\
4:19\
a pretty bad day.\
4:25\
This, of course, applies to us\
physically.\
4:29\
It also applies to us spiritually.\
4:33\
Most of the changes in our\
spiritual lives, both positive\
4:36\
and negative, happen gradually, a\
step at a time.\
4:41\
Like the participants of the Max\
Planck study, we may not realize\
4:46\
when we veer off course.\
4:50\
We may even have high confidence\
4:52\
that we are walking a straight\
line.\
4:56\
But the fact is that without the\
help of landmarks to guide\
4:59\
us, we inevitably deviate off\
course and end up in places we\
5:06\
never thought we would be.\
5:08\
This is true for individuals.\
5:09\
It is also true for societies and\
nations.\
5:14\
The scriptures are filled with\
examples.\
5:17\
The book of Judges records that\
after Joshua died,\
5:23\
there arose another generation\
"which knew not the Lord,\
5:27\
nor yet the works which he had\
done for Israel." Despite\
5:33\
the astonishing heavenly\
interventions,\
5:35\
visitations, rescues, and\
miraculous victories\
5:40\
the children of Israel witnessed\
during the lifetime of Moses\
5:44\
and Joshua within a generation,\
the people had\
5:47\
abandoned the way\
5:50\
and began walking according\
to their own desires.\
5:55\
And of course it did not take long\
before they paid the price\
6:01\
for that behavior.\
6:03\
Sometimes this falling away takes\
generations; sometimes it happens\
6:07\
in a matter of years or even\
months.\
6:10\
But we are all susceptible.\
6:13\
No matter how strong our spiritual\
experiences have been\
6:16\
in the past, as human beings, we\
tend to wander.\
6:21\
That has been the pattern from the\
days of Adam until now.\
6:26\
But all is not lost.\
6:28\
Unlike the wandering test\
subjects, we have\
6:32\
reliable, visible landmarks that\
we can use to evaluate our course.\
6:38\
Now, what are these landmarks?\
6:41\
Surely they include daily prayer\
and pondering the scriptures\
6:45\
and using inspired tools like\
"Come, Follow Me." Each day we\
6:50\
can approach the throne of God in\
humility and honesty.\
6:57\
We can ponder our actions and\
review the moments of our\
7:03\
day, considering our will and\
desires in light of His.\
7:11\
If we have drifted, we plead with\
God to restore us and we commit\
7:17\
to do better.\
7:19\
This time of introspection is an\
opportunity\
7:24\
for recalibration.\
7:26\
It is a garden of reflection where\
we can walk with the Lord\
7:33\
and be instructed, edified, and\
purified by\
7:38\
the written and Spirit-revealed\
word of our Heavenly Father.\
7:43\
It is a sacred time when we\
remember our solemn covenants to\
7:49\
follow the living Christ, when we\
assess our progress and align\
7:56\
ourselves with the spiritual\
landmarks God has provided\
8:01\
for His children.\
8:03\
Think of it as your personal daily\
restoration.\
8:11\
On our journey as pilgrims on the\
path of glory, we know how\
8:16\
easy it is to fall away.\
8:19\
But just as minor deviations can\
draw us out of the Savior's\
8:23\
way, so can, too, small and simple\
acts of realignment\
8:30\
assuredly lead us back.\
8:33\
When darkness creeps into our\
lives, as it often does, our\
8:39\
daily restoration opens our hearts\
to heavenly light, which\
8:45\
illuminates our souls, chasing\
away shadows, fears, and doubts.\
8:52\
If we seek it, surely "God shall\
give unto [us] knowledge by his\
8:58\
Holy Spirit, yea, by the\
unspeakable gift of the Holy\
9:04\
Ghost." As often as we ask, He\
will teach us the way\
9:11\
and help us follow it.\
9:13\
This, of course, takes steady\
effort on our part.\
9:17\
We cannot be content with\
spiritual experience of the past.\
9:21\
We need a steady flow.\
9:23\
We can't rely on others'\
testimonies forever.\
9:28\
We must build our own.\
9:31\
We need an ongoing daily infusion\
of heavenly light.\
9:37\
We need times of refreshing, times\
of personal restoration.\
9:44\
Rolling waters cannot long remain\
impure, says the scriptures.\
9:51\
To keep our thoughts and actions\
pure, we have to keep rolling.\
9:58\
After all, the Restoration of the\
gospel and the Church is not\
10:01\
something that happened once and\
it's over.\
10:05\
It is an ongoing process, one day\
at a time, one heart at a time.\
10:12\
As our days go, so will our lives.\
10:15\
One author put it this way: a day\
is like a whole life.\
10:18\
You start out doing one thing but\
end up doing something else.\
10:25\
Plan to run an errand but never\
get it there.\
10:29\
And at the end of your life, your\
whole existence has\
10:32\
the same random quality too.\
10:35\
Your whole life has the shape of a\
single day.\
10:41\
Do you want to change the shape of\
your life?\
10:44\
Change the shape of your day.\
10:46\
Do you want to change your day,\
change this hour.\
10:51\
Change what you think, feel, and\
do at the very moment.\
10:56\
A small rudder can steer a large\
ship.\
10:59\
Small bricks can become\
magnificent mansions.\
11:05\
Small seeds can become towering\
sequoias.\
11:11\
Minutes and hours well spent are\
the building blocks of a life\
11:18\
well lived.\
11:21\
They can inspire goodness, lift us\
from\
11:24\
the captivity of imperfections,\
and lead us\
11:28\
upwards to the redemptive path of\
forgiveness and sanctification.\
11:37\
With you, I lift my heart in\
gratitude for the magnificent\
11:42\
gift of new opportunity, new life,\
new hope.\
11:48\
We lift our voices in praise of\
our bountiful and forgiving\
11:53\
God, for surely He is a God of new\
beginnings.\
12:00\
The sublime end of all His labor\
is to help us, His\
12:03\
children, succeed in our quest for\
immortality and eternal life.\
12:10\
We can become new creatures in\
Christ, for God has\
12:13\
promised, "As often as my people\
repent [I will] forgive them\
12:18\
their trespasses against me" and\
"remember them no more." My\
12:24\
beloved brothers and sisters, dear\
friends, we all\
12:28\
drift from time to time.\
12:30\
But we can back on course.\
12:32\
We can navigate our way through\
the darkness and trials of this\
12:35\
life and find our way back to our\
loving Heavenly Father if we seek\
12:42\
and accept the spiritual landmarks\
He has provided\
12:48\
and praise personal revelation and\
strive for daily restoration.\
12:53\
This is how we become true\
disciples of our beloved\
12:57\
Savior, Jesus Christ.\
12:59\
As we do so, God will smile upon\
us.\
13:04\
The Lord "shall bless thee in the\
land which the Lord thy God\
13:07\
giveth thee.\
13:09\
The Lord shall establish thee an\
holy people unto himself."\
13:15\
That we will seek daily a\
restoration and continually\
13:19\
strive to walk in the way of Jesus\
Christ is my prayer in\
13:25\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
