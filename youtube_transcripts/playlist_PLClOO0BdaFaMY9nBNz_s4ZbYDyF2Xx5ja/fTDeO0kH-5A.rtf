Mabuhay!\
0:03\
I bring to you love and warm\
smiles from the wonderful Saints\
0:06\
of the Philippines.\
0:09\
This year marks 60 years since the\
first missionaries arrived in\
0:13\
the islands of the Philippines.\
0:17\
Today, there are 22 missions and\
more than 800,000 members of\
0:21\
the Church in 123 stakes.\
0:26\
There are now seven temples in\
operation, under\
0:29\
construction, or announced.\
0:32\
This is truly a miracle.\
0:35\
We are witnessing the fulfillment\
of the prophecy\
0:38\
in 2 Nephi chapter 10, verse 21.\
0:42\
"Great are the promises of the\
Lord and to them who are upon\
0:46\
the isles of the sea." This\
miracle is also a fulfillment of\
0:51\
the prophecy given in a prayer by\
then-Elder Gordon B.\
0:55\
Hinckley in Manila in 1961.\
0:59\
In that prayer, Elder Hinckley\
stated: We invoke their blessings\
1:05\
upon the people of this land, that\
they shall be friendly\
1:09\
and hospitable and kind and\
gracious to those who shall\
1:12\
come here, and that many, Yea,\
Lord, we pray that there\
1:18\
shall be many, many thousands who\
shall receive this message\
1:23\
and be blessed thereby.\
1:25\
Wilt Thou bless them with\
receptive minds\
1:28\
and understanding hearts and with\
faith to receive\
1:32\
and with courage to live the\
principles of the gospel."\
1:37\
Beyond the many, many thousands of\
faithful Latter-day\
1:41\
Saints, the miracle of the gospel\
has brought positive\
1:45\
changes to the country and its\
people.\
1:48\
I am a living witness of this.\
1:51\
I was six years old when my\
parents joined the Church in\
1:55\
the southern island of Mindanao.\
1:58\
At that time, there was only one\
mission in the entire country\
2:02\
and no stakes.\
2:04\
I am eternally grateful for my\
parents' courage and commitment\
2:08\
to follow the Savior.\
2:11\
I honor them and all the pioneers\
of the Church in\
2:14\
the Philippines.\
2:16\
They paved the way for the\
succeeding generations\
2:18\
to be blessed.\
2:21\
King Benjamin in the Book of\
Mormon said, "And\
2:25\
moreover, I would desire that you\
should concede there on\
2:29\
the blessed and happy state of\
those that keep the commandments\
2:33\
of God.\
2:34\
For behold, they are blessed in\
all things, both temporal\
2:38\
and spiritual." As we live and\
obey the principles\
2:43\
and ordinances of the gospel, we\
are blessed,\
2:47\
changed, and converted to becoming\
more like Jesus Christ.\
2:52\
That was how the gospel changed\
and blessed the Filipino\
2:55\
saints, including my family.\
2:58\
The gospel is truly the way to a\
happy, abundant life.\
3:03\
The first principle of the gospel\
is faith in the Lord\
3:07\
Jesus Christ.\
3:09\
Many Filipinos have a natural\
belief in God.\
3:13\
It is easy for us to trust Jesus\
Christ and know that we can\
3:17\
receive answers to our prayers.\
3:21\
The Obedoza of family is a great\
example of this.\
3:25\
Brother Obedoza also was my branch\
president when I was\
3:28\
a young man.\
3:29\
Brother and sister Obedoza's\
greatest desire was to be sealed\
3:33\
to their family in the Manila\
temple.\
3:36\
They lived in General Santos City,\
1,000 miles away from Manila.\
3:42\
For the family of nine,\
3:44\
making the journey to the temple\
seemed impossible.\
3:48\
But like the merchant man who went\
and sold all he had to buy\
3:53\
one pearl of great price, this\
couple decided to sell their\
3:58\
house to pay for the trip.\
4:01\
Sister Obedoza also was worried\
because they would have no home\
4:04\
to return to.\
4:07\
But Brother Obedoza assured her\
that the Lord would provide.\
4:12\
They were sealed as a family for\
time and all eternity in\
4:16\
the temple in 1985.\
4:19\
In the temple, they found joy,\
incomparable -\
4:23\
their priceless pearl.\
4:25\
And true to Brother Obedoza's\
words, the Lord did provide.\
4:31\
On their return from Manila, kind\
acquaintances gave\
4:34\
them places to stay,\
4:37\
and they eventually acquired\
their own home.\
4:40\
The Lord takes care of those who\
demonstrate their faith in Him.\
4:46\
The second principle of the gospel\
is repentance.\
4:50\
Repentance is turning away from\
sin and turning to God\
4:54\
for forgiveness.\
4:56\
It is a change of mind and heart.\
4:58\
As President Nelson teaches, "It\
is doing and being\
5:02\
a little better each day."\
Repentance is a lot like soap.\
5:08\
As a young chemical engineer, I\
worked in a soap\
5:11\
factory in the Philippines.\
5:14\
I learned how to make soap and the\
process of how it works.\
5:19\
When you mix oils with an alkali\
base and add antibacterial\
5:23\
agents, it creates a powerful\
substance that can eliminate\
5:27\
bacteria and viruses.\
5:30\
Like soap repentance is a cleaning\
agent.\
5:34\
It allows us the opportunity to\
get rid of our impurities\
5:38\
and our old debris o we are worthy\
to be with God, as "no\
5:44\
unclean thing can inherit the\
kingdom of God." Through\
5:48\
repentance, we draw upon the\
cleansing, sanctifying power\
5:52\
of Jesus Christ.\
5:54\
It is a key part of the process of\
conversion.\
5:58\
This is what happened to the\
Anti-Nehi-Lehis in the Book\
6:02\
of Mormon.\
6:04\
They were Lamanites who were so\
completely converted that\
6:07\
"they never did fall away." They\
buried their weapons of war\
6:12\
and never took them up again.\
6:15\
They would rather die than break\
that covenant.\
6:19\
And they proved it.\
6:21\
We know that their sacrifice\
brought miracles; thousands of\
6:25\
fought against them threw down\
their weapons and were converted.\
6:30\
Years later, their sons, who we\
know as the mighty stripling\
6:34\
warriors, were protected in battle\
against incredible odds!\
6:40\
My family and many Filipino Saints\
went through a similar\
6:44\
conversion process.\
6:46\
When we accepted the gospel of\
Jesus Christ and joined\
6:49\
the Church, we changed our ways\
and our culture to align to\
6:54\
the gospel.\
6:56\
We had to let go of wrong\
traditions.\
6:59\
I saw this in my father when he\
learned of the gospel\
7:02\
and repented.\
7:04\
He was a heavy smoker, but he\
threw his cigarettes away\
7:08\
and never touched one again.\
7:11\
Because of his decision to change,\
four generations from him\
7:16\
have been blessed.\
7:18\
Repentance leads us to make and\
keep covenants\
7:22\
through sacred ordinances.\
7:24\
The first ordinance of salvation\
and exaltation is baptism by\
7:29\
immersion for the remission of\
sins.\
7:32\
Baptism allows us to receive the\
gift of the Holy Ghost\
7:36\
and enter into a covenant with the\
Lord.\
7:40\
We can renew this baptismal\
covenant every week as we take\
7:44\
the sacrament.\
7:46\
This, too, is a miracle.\
7:49\
Brothers and sisters, I invite you\
to bring this miracle into\
7:54\
your life.\
7:56\
Come to Jesus Christ and choose to\
exercise your faith in\
8:00\
Him; repent and make and keep the\
covenants found in\
8:06\
the ordinances of salvation and\
exaltation.\
8:11\
This will allow you to be yoked\
with Christ and receive\
8:15\
the power and blessings of\
godliness.\
8:19\
I testify of the reality of Jesus\
Christ and that He lives\
8:25\
and loves each one of us.\
8:28\
I know that this gospel can bring\
us hope, peace, and joy, not only\
8:34\
now, but it will bless countless\
others in future generations.\
8:41\
That is the reason for the\
beautiful and warm smiles of\
8:45\
the Filipino Saints.\
8:47\
It is the miracle of the gospel\
and the doctrine of Christ.\
8:52\
I testify of this in the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
