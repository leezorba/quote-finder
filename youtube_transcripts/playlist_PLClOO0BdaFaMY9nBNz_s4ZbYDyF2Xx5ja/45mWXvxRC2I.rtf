Thank you so much, Elder Nielson,\
for your beautiful message.\
0:05\
We needed that.\
0:08\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
President Russell M.\
0:12\
Nelson has taught us recently, and\
I quote: "To do\
0:18\
anything well requires effort.\
0:22\
Becoming a true disciple of Jesus\
Christ is no exception.\
0:28\
Increasing your faith and trust in\
Him takes effort." (Close\
0:34\
quote.) Among the recommendations\
that he gave\
0:38\
us to increase our faith in Jesus\
Christ is that we become engaged\
0:44\
learners, that we immerse\
ourselves in the scriptures to\
0:49\
understand better Christ's mission\
and ministry.\
0:54\
We learn in the Book of Mormon\
that the scriptures were\
0:57\
an important part of Lehi's\
family, so much so that Nephi\
1:04\
and his brothers returned to\
Jerusalem\
1:07\
to obtain the plates of\
brass.\
1:10\
The scriptures reveal God's will\
for us much like the Liahona did\
1:15\
for Nephi and his father.\
1:19\
After he broke his bow, Nephi\
needed to know where he should go\
1:24\
to obtain food.\
1:26\
His father, Lehi, looked at the\
Liahona and saw the things\
1:31\
that were written.\
1:33\
Nephi saw that the spindles\
functioned according to\
1:36\
the faith, diligence, and\
attention given to them.\
1:41\
He also saw writing which was easy\
to read and which gave them\
1:45\
understanding regarding the paths\
of the Lord.\
1:50\
He became aware that the Lord\
brings about great things through\
1:54\
small means.\
1:56\
He was obedient regarding the\
directions given by\
1:59\
the Liahona.\
2:02\
He went up the mountain and\
obtained food for his\
2:04\
family, who had suffered so much\
from the lack thereof.\
2:10\
It seems to me that Nephi was a\
student dedicated to\
2:14\
the scriptures.\
2:16\
We read that Nephi delighted in\
the scriptures, pondered them in\
2:21\
his heart, and wrote them for the\
learning and profit of\
2:26\
his children.\
2:28\
President Russell M.\
2:29\
Nelson said, and I quote, "If we\
'press forward, feasting upon\
2:34\
the word of Christ, and endure to\
the end â€¦ [we] shall have\
2:39\
eternal life.' To feast means more\
than to taste.\
2:44\
To feast means to savor.\
2:47\
We savor the scriptures by\
studying them in a spirit of\
2:51\
delightful discovery and faithful\
obedience.\
2:56\
When we feast upon the words of\
Christ, they are embedded 'in\
3:00\
the fleshy tables of the heart.'\
They become an integral part of\
3:05\
our nature." (Close quote.) What\
are some of the things that we\
3:11\
will do if our souls delighteth in\
the scriptures?\
3:16\
Our desire to be part of the\
gathering of Israel on both\
3:20\
sides of the veil will increase.\
3:24\
It will be normal and natural for\
us to invite our family\
3:27\
and friends to listen to the\
missionaries.\
3:32\
We will be worthy and we will have\
a current temple recommend\
3:36\
in order to go to the temple as\
often as possible.\
3:42\
We will work to find, prepare, and\
submit the names of\
3:46\
our ancestors to the temple.\
3:49\
We will be faithful in keeping the\
Sabbath day, attending church\
3:54\
every Sunday to renew our\
covenants with the Lord as we\
3:59\
participate worthily in taking the\
sacrament.\
4:04\
We will resolve to remain on the\
covenant path, living "by\
4:08\
every word that proceed[s] forth\
from the mouth of God." What does\
4:14\
it mean for you to delight in the\
things of the Lord?\
4:19\
Delighting in the scriptures is\
more than hungering\
4:22\
and thirsting for knowledge.\
4:25\
Nephi experienced great joy during\
his life.\
4:30\
However, he also faced\
difficulties and sadness.\
4:34\
"Nevertheless," he said, "I know\
in whom I have trusted." As we\
4:41\
study the scriptures, we will\
better understand God's plan of\
4:44\
salvation and exaltation, and we\
will trust in the promises that\
4:49\
He has made to us in the\
scriptures, as well as in\
4:54\
the promises and blessings of\
modern prophets.\
5:00\
One afternoon, my wife and I were\
invited to a home of\
5:03\
a friend.\
5:05\
Their 7-year-old son, David, had\
never heard the Bible\
5:09\
story of David and Goliath, and he\
wanted to hear it.\
5:15\
As I began to tell the story, he\
was touched by the way\
5:20\
David, with his faith and in the\
name of the God of\
5:25\
Israel, wounded and killed the\
Philistine with a sling\
5:30\
and a stone, having no sword in\
his hand.\
5:35\
Looking at me with his enormous\
dark eyes, he asked me\
5:39\
firmly, "Who is God?" I explained\
to him that God is\
5:46\
our Heavenly Father and that we\
learn about Him in\
5:49\
the scriptures.\
5:51\
Then he asked me, "What are the\
scriptures?" I told him that\
5:56\
the scriptures are the word of God\
and and that in them he will\
6:01\
find beautiful stories that will\
help him to better know God.\
6:06\
I ask his mother to use the Bible\
that she had in her\
6:10\
home and that she not let David go\
to sleep without reading\
6:15\
the whole story to him.\
6:17\
He was delighted as he listened to\
it.\
6:21\
The scriptures and our knowledge\
of God are gifts, gifts that we\
6:27\
too often take for granted.\
6:30\
Let us cherish these blessings.\
6:34\
While serving a mission as a young\
man, I observed that by\
6:39\
teaching with the scriptures, the\
lives of many\
6:43\
people were transformed.\
6:45\
I became aware of the power in\
them\
6:48\
and how they can change our\
lives.\
6:51\
Each person to whom we taught the\
restored gospel was a unique\
6:55\
individual with different needs.\
6:59\
The holy scriptures, yes, the\
prophecies written by\
7:03\
the holy prophets, brought them to\
a faith in the Lord and to\
7:08\
repentance and changed their\
hearts.\
7:13\
The scriptures filled them with\
joy as they received\
7:17\
inspiration, direction,\
consolation, strength,\
7:22\
and answers to their needs.\
7:25\
Many of them decided to make\
changes in their lives and began\
7:29\
to keep God's commandments.\
7:32\
Nephi encourages us to delight in\
the words of Christ because\
7:37\
the words of Christ will tell us\
all the things we need to do.\
7:43\
I invite you to have a permanent\
plan to study the scriptures.\
7:47\
Come, Follow Me is a great\
resource that we have\
7:51\
for teaching and learning the\
gospel, deepening our\
7:55\
conversion to Jesus Christ and\
helping us to become like Him.\
8:01\
When we study the gospel, we are\
not simply seeking new\
8:05\
information; rather, we are\
seeking to become "a new\
8:09\
creature." The Holy Ghost guides\
us toward truth and testifies to\
8:15\
us of the truth.\
8:17\
He illuminates our mind and renews\
our understanding\
8:21\
and touches our hearts through\
God's revelation, the source of\
8:27\
all truth.\
8:28\
The Holy Ghost purifies our heart.\
8:31\
He inspires in us the desire to\
live according to the truth\
8:35\
and whispers to us ways to do so.\
8:39\
"The Holy Ghost...\
8:40\
shall teach you all things."\
Speaking of the words He revealed\
8:45\
to the Prophet Joseph Smith, our\
Savior said, "These\
8:49\
words are not of men nor of man,\
but of me; â€¦ for it is my\
8:54\
voice, which speaketh them unto\
you; for they are given by my\
8:59\
Spirit unto you; ...\
9:03\
wherefore, you can testify that\
you have heard my voice,\
9:07\
and know my words." We should seek\
the companionship of\
9:11\
the Holy Ghost.\
9:13\
This goal should govern our\
decisions and guide our thoughts\
9:18\
and actions.\
9:19\
We must seek everything that\
invites the influence of\
9:22\
the Spirit and reject anything\
that deviates from this influence.\
9:29\
I testify that Jesus Christ\
9:31\
is the Beloved Son\
of our Heavenly Father.\
9:35\
I love my Savior.\
9:37\
I am grateful for His scriptures\
and for His living prophets.\
9:43\
President Nelson is His prophet.\
9:46\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
