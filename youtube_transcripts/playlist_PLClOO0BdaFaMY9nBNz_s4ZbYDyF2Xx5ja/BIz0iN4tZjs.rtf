Shortly after my mission, while a\
student at BYU, I received\
0:05\
a phone call from my dad.\
0:07\
He told me that he had been\
diagnosed with pancreatic cancer\
0:11\
and that although his chances of\
survival were not good, he was\
0:15\
determined to be healed and return\
to his normal life activities.\
0:20\
That phone call was a sobering\
moment for me.\
0:23\
My dad had been my bishop, my\
friend, and my advisor.\
0:27\
As my mother, my siblings, and I\
contemplated\
0:29\
the future, it appeared bleak.\
0:32\
My younger brother, Dave, was\
serving a mission in New York\
0:35\
and participated long-distance in\
these difficult family events.\
0:40\
The medical providers of the day\
suggested surgery to try\
0:43\
and curtail the spread of the\
cancer.\
0:46\
Our family earnestly fasted and\
prayed for a miracle.\
0:50\
I felt that we had sufficient\
faith\
0:51\
that my father could be\
healed.\
0:54\
Just prior to the surgery, my\
older\
0:55\
brother, Norm, and I gave my dad a\
blessing.\
0:59\
With all the faith we could\
muster, we prayed that he would\
1:01\
be healed.\
1:03\
The surgery was scheduled to last\
many hours, but after just\
1:06\
a short time,\
1:08\
the doctor came to the waiting\
room to meet with our family.\
1:11\
He told us that as they began the\
surgery, they could see that\
1:14\
the cancer had spread throughout\
my father's body.\
1:18\
Based upon what they observed, my\
father had just\
1:21\
a few months to live.\
1:22\
We were devastated.\
1:25\
As my father awakened from the\
surgery, he was anxious to\
1:27\
learn if the procedure had been\
successful.\
1:30\
We shared with him the grim news.\
1:33\
We continued to fast and pray for\
a miracle.\
1:37\
As my father's health quickly\
declined, we began to pray that\
1:40\
he could be free of pain.\
1:43\
Eventually, as his condition\
worsened, we asked the Lord to\
1:46\
allow him to pass quickly.\
1:49\
Just a few months after the\
surgery, as predicted by\
1:52\
the surgeon, my father did pass\
away.\
1:56\
Much love and care were poured out\
upon our family by ward\
1:59\
members and family friends.\
2:01\
We had a beautiful funeral that\
honored the life of my father.\
2:05\
As time passed, however, and we\
experienced the pain of my\
2:09\
father’s absence, I began to\
wonder\
2:11\
why my father had not been\
healed.\
2:14\
I wondered if my faith was not\
strong enough.\
2:18\
Why did some families receive a\
miracle, but our family did not?\
2:23\
I had learned on my mission to\
turn to the scriptures\
2:25\
for answers, and I began to search\
the scriptures.\
2:30\
The Old Testament teaches of an\
aromatic spice or ointment\
2:33\
used for healing wounds that was\
made from a bush grown in Gilead.\
2:38\
In Old Testament times, the\
ointment came to be known\
2:40\
as the balm of Gilead.\
2:42\
The prophet Jeremiah lamented over\
the calamities that he\
2:45\
observed among his people and\
hoped for healing.\
2:49\
Jeremiah questioned, "Is there no\
balm in Gilead; is there no\
2:54\
physician there?" Through\
literature, music, and\
2:57\
art, the Savior Jesus Christ has\
often been referred to as\
3:01\
the Balm of Gilead because of His\
remarkable healing power.\
3:06\
Like Jeremiah, I was wondering, Is\
there no balm in\
3:10\
Gilead for the Nielson family?\
3:14\
In Mark chapter 2 of the New\
Testament,\
3:16\
we find the Savior in\
Capernaum.\
3:19\
Word of the Savior's healing power\
had spread throughout\
3:22\
the land, and many people traveled\
to Capernaum to be\
3:25\
healed by the Savior.\
3:27\
There were so many gathered around\
the house where\
3:29\
the Savior was located that there\
was no room for Him to receive\
3:32\
them all.\
3:33\
Four men carried a man sick of the\
palsy to be healed by\
3:36\
the Savior.\
3:38\
They were unable to make their way\
through the crowd, and\
3:40\
so they uncovered the roof of the\
house and lowered the man\
3:44\
down to meet the Savior.\
3:47\
As I read this account, I was\
surprised by what the Savior said\
3:51\
as He met this man: "Son, thy sins\
be forgiven thee."\
3:58\
I thought that if I had been one\
of the four men who had carried\
4:00\
this man, I might have said to the\
Savior, "We actually brought\
4:04\
him here to be healed." I think\
the Savior might have\
4:08\
replied, "I did heal him." Was it\
possible that I had not fully\
4:14\
understood that the Savior's\
healing power was not just His\
4:18\
ability to heal our bodies, but\
perhaps even more\
4:21\
important, His ability to heal our\
hearts and the broken hearts\
4:26\
of my family?\
4:28\
The Savior taught an important\
lesson through this experience\
4:32\
as He eventually physically healed\
the man.\
4:36\
It became clear to me that His\
message was He could touch\
4:39\
the eyes of those who are blind,\
and they could see.\
4:43\
He could touch the ears of those\
who are deaf, and they could hear.\
4:47\
He could touch the legs of those\
who could not walk, and they\
4:49\
could walk.\
4:51\
He can heal our eyes and our ears\
and our legs, but most important\
4:55\
of all, He can heal our hearts as\
He cleanses us from sin\
5:01\
and lifts us through difficult\
trials.\
5:04\
When the Savior appears to the\
people in the Book of Mormon\
5:07\
after His Resurrection, He again\
speaks of His healing power.\
5:12\
The Nephites hear His voice from\
heaven, saying, "Will ye not now\
5:16\
return unto me, and repent of your\
sins, and be\
5:18\
converted, that I may heal you?"\
Later, the Savior\
5:23\
teaches, "For ye know not but what\
they will return\
5:27\
and repent and come into me with\
full purpose of heart, and\
5:31\
I shall heal them." The Savior was\
not referring to a physical\
5:36\
healing, but rather a spiritual\
healing of their souls.\
5:41\
Moroni brings additional\
understanding as he shares\
5:43\
the words of his father, Mormon.\
5:45\
After speaking of miracles, Mormon\
5:48\
explains, "And Christ hath said,\
If ye will have faith in me\
5:54\
ye shall have power to do\
whatsoever thing is expedient in\
5:57\
me." I learned that the object of\
my faith must be Jesus\
6:02\
Christ, and that I needed to\
accept what was expedient to Him\
6:07\
as I exercised faith in Him.\
6:11\
I understand now\
6:12\
that my father’s passing was\
expedient to God’s plan.\
6:17\
Now, as I lay my hands upon the\
head of another to bless him\
6:21\
or her, my faith is in Jesus\
Christ, and I understand that\
6:25\
a person can and will be\
physically healed if it is\
6:29\
expedient in Christ.\
6:33\
The Savior's Atonement, which\
makes available both His\
6:35\
redeeming and His enabling power,\
is the ultimate blessing\
6:40\
that Jesus Christ offers to all.\
6:43\
As we repent with full purpose of\
heart, the Savior cleanses us\
6:46\
from sin.\
6:47\
As we cheerfully submit our will\
to the Father, even in the most\
6:50\
difficult of circumstances, the\
Savior will\
6:54\
lift our burdens and make them\
light.\
6:55\
But here is the greater lesson I\
learned.\
6:59\
I had mistakenly believe that the\
Savior's healing power had\
7:02\
not worked for my family.\
7:05\
As I now look back with more\
mature eyes and\
7:07\
experience, I see that the\
Savior's healing power was\
7:09\
evident in the lives of each of my\
family members.\
7:14\
I was so focused on a physical\
healing that I failed to see\
7:18\
the miracles that had occurred.\
7:20\
The Lord strengthened and lifted\
my mother beyond her capacity\
7:24\
through this difficult trial, and\
she led a long\
7:28\
and productive life.\
7:29\
She had a remarkable positive\
influence on her children\
7:33\
and grandchildren.\
7:35\
The Lord blessed me and my\
siblings with love,\
7:38\
unity, faith, and resilience that\
became an important part of our\
7:42\
lives and continues today.\
7:46\
But what about my dad?\
7:49\
As with all who will repent, he\
was spiritually healed.\
7:53\
As he sought and received the\
blessings available\
7:55\
because of the Savior's Atonement,\
he received\
7:58\
a remission of his sins and now\
awaits the miracle of\
8:03\
the Resurrection.\
8:05\
The Apostle Paul taught, "For as\
in Adam all die, even so in\
8:09\
Christ shall all be made alive."\
You see, I was saying to\
8:13\
the Savior, "We brought my dad to\
You to be healed." And it is now\
8:18\
clear to me that the Savior did\
heal him.\
8:21\
The Balm of Gilead worked for the\
Nielson family not in\
8:25\
the way that we had supposed, but\
in an even more\
8:28\
significant way that has blessed\
and continues to bless our lives.\
8:34\
In John chapter 6 of the New\
Testament, the Savior performed\
8:36\
a most interesting miracle.\
8:39\
With just a few fish and a few\
loaves of bread, the Savior fed\
8:42\
five thousand.\
8:45\
I have read this account many\
times, but there is a part of\
8:49\
that experience I missed that now\
has great meaning to me.\
8:55\
After the Savior fed five\
thousand, He asked His disciples\
8:58\
to gather up the remaining\
fragments, the leftovers, which\
9:03\
filled 12 baskets.\
9:07\
I've wondered why the Savior took\
the time to do that.\
9:10\
It has become clear to me that one\
lesson we can learn from that\
9:14\
occasion was this:\
9:15\
He could feed five thousand,\
and there were leftovers.\
9:20\
"My grace is sufficient for all\
men." The Savior's redeeming\
9:26\
and healing power can cover any\
sin, wound, or trial, no matter\
9:31\
how large or how difficult- and\
there are leftovers.\
9:35\
His grace is sufficient.\
9:38\
With that knowledge, we can move\
forward with faith, knowing that\
9:41\
when difficult times come, and\
they surely\
9:43\
will, or when sin encompasses our\
lives, the Savior stands with\
9:47\
healing in His wings, inviting us\
to come unto Him.\
9:53\
I bear my witness to you of the\
Balm of Gilead, the Savior\
9:57\
Jesus Christ, our Savior and\
Redeemer, and of His\
10:01\
marvelous healing power, and His\
desire to heal you.\
10:06\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
