In my personal study of the\
scriptures, I have been\
0:05\
impressed by the conversion of\
Saul of Tarsus, who later became\
0:09\
known as Paul, as described in the\
Bible.\
0:12\
Paul was an active man in the\
persecution of the Church\
0:15\
and the Christians.\
0:17\
But because of the power of heaven\
and the Atonement of Jesus\
0:21\
Christ, he was changed completely,\
and he became one of\
0:25\
the great servants of God.\
0:27\
His model of life was the Savior\
Jesus Christ.\
0:32\
In one of Paul's teachings to the\
Corinthians, he invited them\
0:36\
to be his follower as he himself\
was a follower of Christ.\
0:42\
This is a sincere and valid\
invitation from Paul's time until\
0:46\
today: "To be a follower of\
Christ." I began to reflect\
0:52\
on what it means to become a\
follower of Christ, and more\
0:56\
important, I began to ask, In what\
way should\
1:00\
I imitate Him?\
1:02\
To be a follower, of course, is to\
strive to conform\
1:06\
our actions, conduct, and lives to\
those of the Savior.\
1:11\
It is to acquire virtues.\
1:13\
It is to be a true disciple of\
Jesus Christ.\
1:17\
I have studied some aspects of the\
Savior's life, and I have\
1:20\
retained, as part of my message\
today, four of His qualities that\
1:25\
I try to imitate and that I share\
with you.\
1:30\
The first quality of the Savior is\
humility.\
1:34\
Jesus Christ was very humble from\
the premortal life.\
1:38\
At the Council in Heaven, He\
recognized and allowed the will\
1:42\
of God to prevail in the plan of\
salvation for mankind.\
1:48\
He said, "Father, thy will be\
done, and the glory be thine\
1:54\
forever." We know that Jesus\
Christ taught humility\
1:58\
and humbled Himself to glorify His\
Father.\
2:02\
Let us live in humility because it\
brings peace.\
2:06\
Humility precedes glory, and it\
brings God's favor upon\
2:10\
us: "Yea, all of you be subject\
one to another, and be clothed\
2:17\
with humility: for God resisteth\
the proud, and giveth grace to\
2:23\
the humble." Humility brings\
gentle answers.\
2:27\
It is the source of righteous\
character.\
2:31\
Elder Dale G.\
2:32\
Renlund taught, "Individuals who\
walk humbly with God remember\
2:37\
what Heavenly Father and Jesus\
Christ have done for them.\
2:41\
We act honorably with God by\
walking humbly with Him." The\
2:46\
second quality of the Savior is\
courage.\
2:51\
When I think of Jesus Christ at\
the age of 12, sitting in\
2:55\
the temple of God among the\
doctors of the law\
2:58\
and teaching them divine things, I\
know that He already\
3:02\
had, very early in His life, a\
good sense of\
3:07\
courage, a particular courage.\
3:10\
While most will expect to see the\
young boy being taught by\
3:14\
the doctors of the law, He was\
teaching them as "they were\
3:18\
hearing him, and asking him\
questions." We served\
3:23\
a full-time mission in the\
Democratic Republic of\
3:25\
the Congo Mbuji-Mayi Mission from\
2016 to 2019.\
3:30\
The way to travel in the zone\
through the mission from one zone\
3:34\
to another was by road.\
3:37\
A phenomenon has arisen in that\
area, with bandits armed with\
3:42\
bladed weapons breaking onto the\
roads and disturbing\
3:46\
the movement of travelers.\
3:49\
Five missionaries traveling from\
one zone to another as part of\
3:53\
the transfer were victims of these\
disturbances.\
3:57\
Having been victims of this\
phenomenon ourselves sometimes\
4:01\
before, we began to fear for the\
lives and the safety of all\
4:07\
of us, even hesitating to travel\
on those roads to visit\
4:12\
the missionaries and hold zone\
conferences.\
4:16\
We didn't know how long it was\
going to last.\
4:21\
I drew up a report, which I sent\
to the Area Presidency, and\
4:25\
I expressed my feelings of fear\
about continuing to travel when\
4:31\
the road was the only way to reach\
our missionaries.\
4:35\
In his reply, Elder Kevin\
Hamilton, who was our president\
4:39\
of the Africa Southeast Area,\
wrote to me: "My counsel is\
4:44\
to do the best you can.\
4:46\
Be wise and be prayerful.\
4:49\
Do not knowingly put yourselves\
[and] your missionaries in harm's\
4:53\
way, but at the same time go\
forward in faith.\
4:57\
'For God hath not given us the\
spirit of fear; but of\
5:02\
power, and of love, and of a sound\
mind.'" This exhortation\
5:08\
greatly strengthened us and\
allowed us to continue to\
5:12\
travel and serve with courage\
until the end of our mission\
5:17\
because we heard the direction\
from our Father in Heaven through\
5:21\
that scripture.\
5:23\
In modern scripture, we read the\
inspired words of\
5:26\
the Prophet Joseph Smith,\
reflecting the Lord's\
5:29\
encouragement to us: "Brethren,\
shall we not go on in\
5:34\
so great a cause?\
5:36\
Go forward and not backward.\
5:39\
Courage, brethren; and on, on to\
the victory!" Let us\
5:44\
have the courage to do what is\
right, even when it is\
5:47\
unpopular; the courage to defend\
our faith and to act by faith.\
5:53\
Let us have the courage to repent\
daily; the courage to accept\
5:58\
God's will and obey His\
commandments.\
6:01\
Let us have the courage to live\
righteously and to do what is\
6:05\
expected of us in our various\
responsibilities and positions.\
6:10\
The third quality of the Savior is\
forgiveness.\
6:14\
During His mortal ministry, the\
Savior prevented\
6:18\
a woman who had been taken in\
adultery from being stoned.\
6:22\
He charged her to "go, and sin no\
more." This moved her toward\
6:29\
repentance and eventual\
forgiveness for, as\
6:32\
the scriptures record, "the woman\
glorified God from that hour\
6:36\
and believed on his name." During\
a Christmas devotional in\
6:41\
December 2018, our dear President\
Russell M.\
6:44\
Nelson spoke about four gifts we\
have received from the Savior.\
6:50\
He said that one gift the Savior\
offers is the ability to forgive.\
6:55\
Through His infinite Atonement,\
you can forgive those\
6:59\
who have hurt you and who may\
never accept responsibility of\
7:04\
their cruelty to you.\
7:05\
"It is usually easy to forgive one\
who sincerely and humbly\
7:10\
seeks your forgiveness.\
7:12\
But the Savior will grant you the\
ability to forgive anyone who\
7:17\
has mistreated you in any way."\
Let us sincerely forgive each\
7:21\
other to obtain the forgiveness of\
the Father.\
7:25\
Forgiveness sets us free and makes\
us worthy to partake of\
7:29\
the sacrament every Sunday.\
7:31\
Forgiveness is required of us to\
7:33\
be truly disciples of Jesus\
Christ.\
7:36\
The fourth quality of the Savior\
is sacrifice.\
7:40\
It is part of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ.\
7:43\
The Savior gave the supreme\
sacrifice of His life for us\
7:47\
so that we will be redeemed.\
7:50\
Feeling the pain of sacrifice, He\
asked His Father to\
7:54\
keep the cup away, but He went to\
the end of the eternal sacrifice.\
7:58\
This is the Atonement of Jesus\
Christ.\
8:03\
President M.\
8:06\
Russell Ballard taught this:\
"Sacrifice is\
8:10\
the demonstration of pure love.\
8:13\
The degree of our love [to] the\
Lord, for the gospel,\
8:17\
and for our fellow men can be\
measured by what we are willing\
8:22\
to sacrifice for them." We can\
sacrifice our time to perform\
8:26\
ministering, to serve others, to\
do good, to do family\
8:31\
history work, and to magnify our\
Church calling.\
8:35\
We can give of our financial means\
by paying tithing, fast\
8:40\
offerings, and other donations to\
build the kingdom of God\
8:45\
on earth.\
8:46\
We need sacrifice to keep the\
covenants we have made with\
8:50\
the Savior.\
8:52\
My prayer is that by following\
Jesus Christ and drawing upon\
8:57\
the blessings of His Atonement, we\
become more\
9:01\
and more humble, we are more\
courageous, we forgive more\
9:05\
and more, and we sacrifice more\
for His kingdom.\
9:09\
I testify that Heavenly Father\
lives and He knows each of us\
9:13\
individually, that Jesus is the\
Christ,\
9:17\
that President Russell M.\
9:18\
Nelson is God's prophet today.\
9:21\
I testify The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints is\
9:25\
the kingdom of God on the earth,\
and the Book of Mormon is true.\
9:30\
In the name of Jesus Christ, our\
Redeemer, amen.\
