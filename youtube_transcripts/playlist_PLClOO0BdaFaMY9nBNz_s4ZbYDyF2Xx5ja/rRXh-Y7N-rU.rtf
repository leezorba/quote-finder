Brothers and sisters, do you know\
how completely God, our Heavenly\
0:06\
Father, loves you?\
0:09\
Have you felt His love deep in\
your soul?\
0:14\
When you know and understand how\
completely you are loved as\
0:18\
a child of God, it changes\
everything.\
0:23\
It changes the way you feel about\
yourself when you make mistakes.\
0:27\
It changes how you feel when\
difficult things happen.\
0:32\
It changes your view of God's\
commandments.\
0:36\
It changes your view of others and\
of your capacity to make\
0:40\
a difference.\
0:43\
Elder Jeffrey R.\
0:44\
Holland taught, "The first great\
commandment of all eternity is to\
0:49\
love God with all of our heart,\
might, mind,\
0:53\
and strength- that's the first\
great commandment.\
0:58\
But the first great truth of all\
eternity is that God loves us\
1:03\
with all of His heart, might,\
mind, and strength." How\
1:09\
can each of us know deep in our\
souls\
1:11\
that great truth of\
eternity?\
1:15\
The prophet Nephi was shown in\
vision, the most powerful\
1:19\
evidence of God's love.\
1:22\
Upon viewing the tree of life,\
Nephi asked to know\
1:26\
the interpretation thereof.\
1:29\
In answer, an angel showed Nephi a\
city, a mother, and a baby.\
1:38\
As Nephi looked upon the city of\
Nazareth and the righteous mother\
1:42\
Mary, holding the infant Jesus in\
her arms, the angel\
1:46\
declared, "Behold the lamb of God.\
1:50\
Yea, even the Son of the Eternal\
Father!"\
1:57\
At that sacred moment Nephi\
understood that in the birth of\
2:00\
the Savior, God was showing forth\
His pure and complete love.\
2:07\
God's love, Nephi testified,\
"Sheddeth itself\
2:10\
abroad in the hearts of the\
children of men."\
2:16\
We can picture the love of God as\
light emanating from the tree\
2:20\
of life, shedding itself abroad\
over all the earth, into\
2:24\
the hearts of the children of men.\
2:28\
God's light and love permeate all\
His creations.\
2:34\
Sometimes we mistakenly think that\
we can only feel God's love\
2:38\
after we have followed the iron\
rod and partaken of the fruit.\
2:45\
God's love, however, is not only\
received by those who come to\
2:48\
the tree, but is the very power\
that motivates us\
2:54\
to seek that tree.\
2:57\
"Wherefore, it is the most\
desirable above all\
3:00\
things," Nephi taught, and the\
angel exclaimed,\
3:04\
"Yea, and the most joyous to the\
soul."\
3:09\
Twenty years ago, a beloved family\
member stepped away from\
3:13\
the Church.\
3:15\
He had many unanswered questions.\
3:18\
His wife, a convert, stayed true\
to her faith.\
3:23\
They worked hard to preserve their\
marriage in\
3:25\
the differences that arose.\
3:28\
Last year, he wrote down three\
questions about the Church that\
3:33\
were difficult for him to\
reconcile, and sent them to two\
3:37\
couples who had been his friends\
for several years.\
3:42\
He invited them to reflect on\
those questions and come to\
3:45\
dinner to share their thoughts.\
3:49\
Following this visit with friends,\
he went to his room\
3:53\
and started working on a project.\
3:57\
The evening conversation and the\
love shown to him by his\
4:01\
friends came to the forefront of\
his mind.\
4:05\
He later wrote that he was\
compelled to stop his work.\
4:09\
He said, "A bright light filled my\
soul.\
4:15\
I was familiar with this deep\
feeling of enlightenment, but in\
4:19\
this case it continued to grow\
stronger than ever before\
4:24\
and lasted for several minutes.\
4:28\
I sat quietly with the feeling,\
which I came to\
4:31\
understand as a manifestation of\
the love of God for me.\
4:39\
I felt a spiritual impression that\
told me I could return to\
4:42\
Church and express this love of\
God in what I do there."\
4:50\
He then wondered about his\
questions.\
4:53\
The feeling he received was that\
God honored his\
4:56\
questions, and that not having\
clear answers should not stop him\
5:01\
from moving forward.\
5:03\
He should share\
Godâ€™s love with all\
5:06\
while he continued to\
contemplate.\
5:10\
As he acted on that impression, he\
felt a kinship\
5:14\
with Joseph Smith, who remarked\
after his First Vision, "My soul\
5:19\
was filled with love and for many\
days I could rejoice\
5:23\
with great joy."\
5:27\
Remarkably, a few short months\
later, he received the same\
5:31\
calling he had held 20 years\
before.\
5:36\
The first time he held the\
calling, he performed his\
5:39\
responsibilities as a dutiful\
member of the Church.\
5:44\
Now the question for him became\
not, "How can I fulfill this\
5:50\
calling?" but, "How can I show\
God's love through my service?"\
5:58\
With this new approach, he felt\
joy, meaning, and purpose in all\
6:02\
aspects of his calling.\
6:06\
Sisters and brothers, how can we\
receive the transforming power of\
6:11\
God's love?\
6:13\
The prophet Mormon invites us to\
"pray unto the Father with all\
6:18\
the energy of heart, that ye may\
be filled with this love, which\
6:23\
he hath bestowed upon all who are\
true followers of his\
6:27\
Son, Jesus Christ." Mormon is not\
only inviting us to pray that we\
6:34\
may be filled with His love for\
others, but to pray that we\
6:39\
may know of God's pure love for\
ourselves.\
6:46\
As we receive His love, we find\
greater joy in striving to love\
6:51\
and serve as He did, becoming true\
followers of His\
6:55\
Son, Jesus Christ.\
6:59\
God's love is not found in the\
circumstances of our\
7:03\
lives, but in His presence in our\
lives.\
7:08\
We know of His love when we\
receive strength beyond our\
7:12\
own, and when His Spirit brings\
peace, comfort, and direction.\
7:19\
At times it may be difficult to\
feel His love.\
7:23\
We can pray to have our eyes\
opened, to see His hand in our\
7:28\
lives, and to see His love in the\
beauty of His creations.\
7:35\
As we ponder the Savior's life and\
His infinite\
7:38\
sacrifice, we begin to understand\
His love for us.\
7:43\
We reverently sing the words of\
Eliza R.\
7:46\
Snow: "His precious blood He\
freely spilt.\
7:52\
His life He freely gave." Jesus's\
humility and suffering for us\
7:59\
distills upon our souls, opening\
our hearts to seek forgiveness at\
8:04\
His hand and filling us with a\
desire to live as He did.\
8:11\
President Nelson wrote, "The more\
committed we become to patterning\
8:16\
our lives after His, the purer and\
more\
8:19\
divine our love becomes."\
8:24\
Our son related, "When I was 11,\
my friends and I decided to\
8:29\
hide from our teacher and skip the\
first half of our primary class.\
8:35\
When we finally arrived, to our\
surprise,\
8:39\
the teacher greeted us\
warmly.\
8:43\
He then offered a heartfelt prayer\
during which he expressed\
8:47\
sincere gratitude to the Lord that\
we had decided to come to\
8:52\
class that day of our own free\
will.\
8:58\
I cannot remember what the lesson\
was about, or even our\
9:01\
teacher's name, but now, some 30\
years later, I am still touched\
9:08\
by the pure love he showed me that\
day."\
9:13\
Five years ago, I observed an\
example of divine love while\
9:17\
attending Primary in Russia.\
9:20\
I saw a faithful sister kneel in\
front of two children\
9:25\
and testify to them that even if\
they were the only ones living\
9:30\
on earth, Jesus would have\
suffered and died just for them.\
9:37\
I testify that our Lord and Savior\
did indeed die\
9:41\
for each and every one of us.\
9:43\
It was an expression of His\
infinite love for us\
9:46\
and for His Father.\
9:48\
"I know that my Redeemer lives.\
9:51\
What comfort this sweet sentence\
gives.\
9:54\
He lives to bless us with His\
love." May we open our hearts to\
9:59\
receive the pure love that God has\
for us and then shed forth\
10:03\
His love in all we do and are.\
10:06\
In the sacred name of Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
