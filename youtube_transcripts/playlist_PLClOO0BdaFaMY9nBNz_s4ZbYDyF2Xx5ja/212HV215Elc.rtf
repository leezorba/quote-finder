The COVID 19 pandemic has been one\
of the many trials\
0:06\
and challenges that God's children\
have confronted\
0:09\
throughout the history of the\
world.\
0:11\
At the beginning of this year, my\
beloved family and\
0:14\
I lived through some dark days.\
0:16\
The pandemic, and other causes,\
brought death and pain to\
0:20\
our family through the passing of\
some dear loved ones.\
0:25\
Despite medical attention, fasting\
and prayer\
0:28\
during the course of five weeks,\
my brother, my\
0:31\
sister, and my brother-in-law\
crossed to the other side of\
0:34\
the veil.\
0:35\
At times, I have wondered why the\
Savior cried when He saw Mary\
0:39\
anguished by the death of her\
brother, Lazarus, knowing that He\
0:44\
had the power to raise Lazarus and\
that very soon the Savior\
0:49\
would use this power to rescue His\
friend from death.\
0:52\
I am amazed by the Savior's\
compassion and empathy for Mary.\
0:57\
He understood that indescribable\
pain that Mary felt at the death\
1:02\
of her brother, Lazarus.\
1:04\
We feel that same intense pain\
when we experience the temporary\
1:09\
separation from our loved ones.\
1:12\
The Savior has perfect compassion\
for us.\
1:15\
He doesn't fault us for our\
shortsightedness, nor for being\
1:20\
limited in visualizing our eternal\
journey.\
1:23\
Rather, He has compassion for us,\
our sadness,\
1:27\
and suffering.\
1:28\
Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus\
Christ, want us to\
1:31\
have joy.\
1:33\
President Russell M.\
1:34\
Nelson has taught, "The joy we\
feel has little to do with\
1:39\
the circumstances of our lives and\
everything to do with\
1:43\
the focus of our lives." When the\
focus of our lives is\
1:46\
on God's plan of salvation, we can\
feel joy\
1:49\
regardless of what is happening or\
not happening in our lives.\
1:54\
When I was a young missionary, I\
remember when\
1:57\
a marvelous missionary that I had\
come to admire received\
2:01\
some devastating news.\
2:03\
His mother and his younger brother\
had passed away in\
2:06\
a tragic accident.\
2:07\
The mission president offered this\
elder the option to return\
2:10\
home for the funeral.\
2:13\
However, after speaking with his\
father on the phone, this\
2:17\
missionary decided to stay and\
finish his mission.\
2:20\
A short time later, when we were\
serving in the same zone, my\
2:24\
companion and I received an\
emergency call.\
2:28\
Some thieves had stolen the\
bicycle belonging to this\
2:32\
same missionary and had injured\
him with a knife.\
2:36\
He and his companion had to walk\
to the nearest hospital, where my\
2:41\
companion and I met up with them.\
2:43\
On the way to the hospital, I was\
grieving\
2:46\
for this missionary.\
2:47\
I imagined that his spirit would\
be low and that surely after this\
2:52\
traumatic experience, he would now\
want to return home.\
2:57\
However, when we arrived at the\
hospital, I saw this\
3:00\
missionary lying in his bed,\
waiting to be taken into\
3:03\
surgery, and he was smiling.\
3:06\
I thought, how could he be smiling\
at a time like this?\
3:10\
While he was recuperating in the\
hospital, he enthusiastically\
3:14\
handed out pamphlets and copies of\
the Book of Mormon to\
3:18\
the doctors, nurses, and other\
patients.\
3:21\
Even with these trials, he did not\
want to go home.\
3:25\
Rather, he served until the last\
day of his mission with\
3:29\
faith, energy, strength, and\
enthusiasm.\
3:33\
The beginning of the Book of\
Mormon, Nephi states, "Having\
3:36\
seen many afflictions in the\
course of my days,\
3:40\
nevertheless, having been highly\
favored of the Lord in all my\
3:43\
days." I think of the many trials\
that Nephi experienced, many of\
3:48\
which are included in his writing.\
3:51\
His trials help us understand that\
we all have our dark days.\
3:56\
One of these trials occurred when\
Nephi was commanded to return to\
4:00\
Jerusalem to obtain the brass\
plates\
4:03\
that Laban had in his\
possession.\
4:05\
Some of Nephi's brothers were men\
of little faith, and they even\
4:10\
beat Nephi with a stick.\
4:13\
Nephi experienced another trial\
when he broke his bow and could\
4:17\
not obtain food for his family.\
4:20\
Later, when he was commanded to\
build a ship, his brothers mocked\
4:24\
him and refused to help him.\
4:27\
Despite these and many other\
trials during the course of his\
4:31\
life, Nephi always recognized the\
goodness of God.\
4:36\
As his family was crossing the\
ocean on the way to\
4:40\
the promised land, some of Nephi's\
family began to make\
4:44\
themselves merry and to speak\
harshly and forget that it was\
4:48\
the Lord's power that had\
preserved them.\
4:52\
When Nephi chastised them, they\
became offended\
4:57\
and bound him with cords so that\
he was unable to move.\
5:02\
The Book of Mormon states that his\
brethren did treat him with\
5:07\
much harshness, his wrists and\
ankles were much swollen\
5:12\
and great was the soreness.\
5:14\
Nephi was grieved with the\
hardness of his brothers'\
5:17\
hearts and at times felt overcome\
with sorrow.\
5:22\
"Nevertheless," he declared, "I\
did look unto my God\
5:27\
and I did praise him all day long;\
and I did not murmur\
5:32\
against the Lord because of my\
afflictions." My dear brothers\
5:35\
and sisters, how did we react to\
our afflictions?\
5:39\
Do we murmur before the Lord\
because of them?\
5:42\
Or like Nephi and my former\
missionary friend do we feel\
5:46\
thankful in word, thought, and\
deed because we are\
5:49\
more focused on our blessings than\
our problems?\
5:53\
Our Savior, Jesus Christ, gave us\
the example during his early\
5:58\
ministry in moments of difficulty\
and trial.\
6:01\
There are few things that bring to\
us greater peace\
6:04\
and satisfaction than serving our\
fellow man.\
6:08\
The book of Matthew recounts what\
happened when the Savior learned\
6:13\
that His cousin, John the Baptist,\
had been beheaded by\
6:16\
King Herod to please the daughter\
of Herodias.\
6:20\
"And his disciples came, and took\
up the body, and buried\
6:24\
it, and went and told Jesus.\
6:27\
When Jesus heard of it, he\
departed thence by ship into\
6:31\
a desert place apart: and when the\
people had heard\
6:34\
thereof, they followed him on foot\
out of the cities.\
6:38\
And Jesus went forth, and saw a\
great multitude, and was moved\
6:43\
with compassion toward them, And\
he healed their sick.\
6:47\
And when it was evening, his\
disciples came to him,\
6:50\
saying, This is a desert place,\
and the time is now\
6:54\
past,; since the multitude away,\
that they may go into\
6:58\
the villages, and buy themselves\
victuals.\
7:01\
But Jesus said to them, They need\
not depart; give ye them to eat."\
7:06\
Jesus Christ showed us that during\
times of trial\
7:12\
and adversity, we can recognize\
the difficulties of others.\
7:17\
Moved with compassion, we can\
reach out and lift them.\
7:21\
And as we do so, we are also\
lifted by our Christlike service.\
7:26\
President Gordon B.\
7:28\
Hinckley stated: "The best\
antidote I know for worry is work.\
7:33\
The best medicine for despair is\
service.\
7:36\
The best cure for worrying is the\
challenge of helping someone\
7:40\
who is even more tired.\
7:43\
In this, the Church of Jesus\
Christ, I have had many\
7:47\
opportunities to minister and\
serve my fellow man.\
7:52\
It is at those times when I feel\
that Heavenly Father lightens my\
7:57\
burdens." President Russell M.\
7:59\
Nielsen is the Prophet of God on\
earth.\
8:03\
He is a great example of how we\
should minister to others during\
8:08\
difficult trials.\
8:10\
I unite my testimony with those of\
many other saints that God is\
8:15\
our loving, Heavenly Father.\
8:17\
I have felt His infinite love\
during my dark days.\
8:22\
Our Savior, Jesus Christ,\
understands our pains\
8:25\
and our afflictions.\
8:27\
He wants to ease our burdens and\
comfort us.\
8:32\
We must follow His example by\
serving and minister to those\
8:37\
with even greater burdens than our\
own.\
8:41\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
