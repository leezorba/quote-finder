I also offer a warm welcome\
0:03\
to each of you participating\
in this conference.\
0:07\
Today, I hope to describe two\
elements of the restored gospel\
0:11\
of Jesus Christ, followed by four\
stirring accounts from Latter-day\
0:15\
Saints around the world\
demonstrating the application of\
0:19\
these principles.\
0:21\
The first element of the restored\
gospel, God's work\
0:25\
of salvation and exaltation,\
focuses on divinely\
0:29\
appointed responsibilities.\
0:32\
The second element reminds us that\
the gospel is plain,\
0:37\
precious, and simple.\
0:40\
To receive eternal life, we must\
come unto Christ and be perfected\
0:43\
in Him.\
0:45\
As we come unto Christ and help\
others do the same, we\
0:48\
participate in God's work of\
salvation and exaltation, which\
0:52\
focuses on divinely appointed\
responsibilities.\
0:57\
These divine responsibilities\
align with the priesthood keys\
1:01\
restored by Moses, Elias, Elijah,\
recorded in the 110th\
1:07\
section of the Doctrine and\
Covenants, and the second\
1:10\
great commandment given to us by\
Jesus Christ to love our\
1:14\
neighbors as ourselves.\
1:17\
They are found on the first two\
pages of the updated General\
1:20\
Handbook available to all members.\
1:24\
If hearing the words "General\
Handbook" or "divinely appointed\
1:28\
responsibilities" causes you to\
shudder in fear of\
1:32\
complexity, please don't.\
1:35\
These responsibilities are simple,\
inspirational,\
1:41\
motivating, and doable.\
1:43\
Here they are.\
1:44\
First, Living the Gospel of Jesus\
Christ.\
1:48\
Next, Caring for Those in Need.\
1:53\
Third, Inviting All to Receive the\
Gospel.\
1:57\
And fourth, Uniting Families for\
Eternity.\
2:01\
You might view them, as I do, as a\
roadmap to return back\
2:04\
to our loving Heavenly Father.\
2:06\
It has been said that the gospel\
of Jesus Christ is simply\
2:12\
beautiful, and beautifully simple.\
2:15\
The world is not.\
2:16\
It is complicated, complex, and\
filled with turmoil\
2:20\
and strife.\
2:21\
We are blessed as we exercise care\
not to allow the complexity\
2:26\
so common in the world to enter\
into the way we receive\
2:30\
and practice the gospel.\
2:33\
President Dallin H.\
2:34\
Oaks observed, "We are taught many\
small and simple things in\
2:37\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
2:39\
We need to be reminded that in\
total and over a significant\
2:43\
period of time, those seemingly\
small things bring to pass great\
2:50\
things." Jesus Christ Himself\
describes that His yoke is easy\
2:56\
and His burden is light.\
2:58\
We should all strive to keep the\
gospel simple in our\
3:01\
lives, in our families, in our\
classes and quorums, and in our\
3:05\
wards and stakes.\
3:07\
As you listen to the following\
stories that I'll share with you\
3:11\
now, recognize they've been\
carefully chosen to inspire\
3:14\
on the one hand, and to inform on\
the other.\
3:18\
The actions of each of these\
Latter-day Saints becomes\
3:22\
a model for each of us applying\
the gospel in plain,\
3:25\
precious, simple ways while\
fulfilling one of the divinely\
3:30\
appointed responsibilities just\
introduced.\
3:34\
First, Living the Gospel of Jesus\
Christ.\
3:38\
Jens of Denmark prays daily to\
live the gospel and notice\
3:41\
promptings from the Holy Ghost.\
3:45\
He has learned to act quickly when\
he feels directed by\
3:49\
the Spirit.\
3:50\
Jens shared the following, quote,\
"We live in\
3:55\
an idyllic small half-timbered\
house with a thatched roof in\
3:59\
the center of a cozy little\
village close to the village pond.\
4:05\
On this night with the most\
beautiful Danish summer weather\
4:09\
imaginable, doors and windows were\
open and everything breathed\
4:13\
peace and quiet.\
4:15\
Due to our gloriously bright and\
long summer nights, I had not\
4:19\
been in a hurry to replace a\
burned out light bulb in our\
4:24\
utility room.\
4:26\
Suddenly, I got a strong feeling\
that I had to replace it\
4:29\
immediately.\
4:31\
At the same time, I heard my wife,\
Marianne, call for me\
4:34\
and the children to wash our hands\
because dinner was ready.\
4:39\
I'd been married long enough to\
know that this was not the time\
4:42\
to start doing anything else than\
washing my hands.\
4:46\
But I heard myself calling out to\
Marianne that I would just pop\
4:49\
over to the store and buy a new\
light bulb.\
4:52\
I felt a strong urge to leave\
immediately.\
4:55\
The grocery store was only on the\
other side of the pond.\
4:59\
We usually walked, but today I\
grabbed my bike.\
5:04\
While riding past the pond, out of\
the corner of my\
5:06\
eye, I noticed a small boy about\
two years old walking alone near\
5:13\
the edge of the pond, very close\
to the water.\
5:16\
Suddenly, he fell in.\
5:18\
One minute he was there, and the\
next he was gone.\
5:23\
No one had seen this happen but\
me.\
5:26\
I threw my bike on the ground,\
ran, and jumped into\
5:29\
the waist-high pond.\
5:31\
The surface of the water\
immediately closed with duck\
5:33\
weed, making it impossible to see\
through the water.\
5:38\
Then I sense movement to one side.\
5:40\
I put my arm in the water, got\
ahold of a T-shirt\
5:44\
and pulled the little boy up.\
5:47\
He started gasping, coughing, and\
crying.\
5:51\
Soon afterward, the boy was\
reunited with his\
5:54\
parents," close quote.\
5:59\
As brother Jens prays each morning\
for help to recognize\
6:02\
promptings from the Holy Ghost,\
even something as unusual\
6:06\
as to immediately change a light\
bulb, he also prays that he he\
6:11\
can be used as a tool to bless\
God's children.\
6:15\
Jens lives the gospel by seeking\
divine direction each\
6:19\
day, striving to be worthy, then\
doing his best to\
6:22\
follow that direction when it\
comes.\
6:27\
Here is an example of caring for\
those in need.\
6:32\
One day, a stake president in the\
Cuquita Stake in Colombia\
6:35\
accompanied the Stake Young Women\
President to visit two young\
6:38\
women and their older teenage\
brother who were going through\
6:42\
some terrible struggles.\
6:44\
Recently, their father had passed\
away and their mother had passed\
6:49\
away a year before.\
6:51\
The three siblings were now left\
all alone in their small,\
6:55\
humble shelter.\
6:57\
The walls were made of crude wood\
lined with plastic bags, and\
7:00\
the corrugated tin roof covered\
only the area where they slept.\
7:05\
Following their visit, the leaders\
knew that they needed\
7:08\
to help.\
7:09\
Through the ward council a plan to\
help them begin to emerge.\
7:14\
Ward and stake leaders, Relief\
Society, elders quorum, young\
7:18\
men, young women, and many\
families all set themselves to\
7:21\
the task of blessing this family.\
7:24\
The ward organizations contacted\
several ward members\
7:27\
who work in construction.\
7:29\
Some helped with design.\
7:31\
Others donated time and labor.\
7:33\
Others made meals and still others\
donated needed materials.\
7:38\
When the little house was\
finished, it was a joyful day\
7:41\
for those who helped and for the\
three young ward members.\
7:47\
These orphaned children felt warm\
and reassuring bonds of their\
7:50\
ward family to know that they are\
not alone and that God is always\
7:56\
there for them.\
7:57\
Those who reached out felt the\
love of the Savior for this\
8:00\
family and acted as His hands in\
serving them.\
8:06\
I think you'll enjoy this example\
of inviting all to receive\
8:09\
the gospel.\
8:12\
Seventeen-year-old Cleiton of Cape\
Verde had no idea what would\
8:16\
happen as a result of walking into\
his ward seminary class one\
8:20\
day, but his life and the lives of\
others would be forever\
8:24\
changed because he did.\
8:26\
Cleiton, along with his mother and\
older brother, had been\
8:28\
baptized into the Church some time\
earlier, and yet the family\
8:32\
stopped attending.\
8:34\
His single act of attending\
seminary would prove to be\
8:37\
a hinge point for the family.\
8:40\
The other youth in the seminary\
class were warm and welcoming.\
8:44\
They made Cleiton feel at home and\
encouraged him to attend\
8:47\
another activity.\
8:49\
He did so and soon began attending\
his other Church meetings.\
8:54\
A wise bishop saw his potential\
8:57\
and invited him to be his\
assistant.\
9:00\
From that moment on, says Bishop\
Pina, Cleiton became an example\
9:05\
and an influence to other young\
people.\
9:08\
The first person Cleiton invited\
back to Church was his mother.\
9:14\
Then his older brother.\
9:15\
He then widened his circle to\
friends.\
9:18\
One of these friends was a young\
man his own age, Wilson.\
9:23\
Upon his very first meeting with\
the missionaries, Wilson\
9:27\
expressed his desire to be\
baptized.\
9:31\
The missionaries were impressed\
and amazed at how much Cleiton\
9:34\
had already shared with Wilson.\
9:39\
Cleiton's efforts didn't stop\
there.\
9:41\
He helped other less active\
members return in addition to\
9:44\
sharing the gospel with friends of\
other faiths.\
9:48\
Today, the ward has 35 active\
youth with a thriving seminary\
9:53\
program, thanks in large part to\
Cleiton's efforts to\
9:58\
love, share, and invite.\
10:02\
Cleiton, along with his older\
brother, Cleiber, are both\
10:05\
preparing to serve full-time\
missions.\
10:09\
Finally, let me share a beautiful\
example of uniting\
10:12\
families for eternity.\
10:14\
Lydia, from Kharkiv, Ukraine,\
first learned about\
10:17\
the temple from the missionaries.\
10:21\
Immediately Lydia felt a fervent\
desire to attend the\
10:24\
temple, and after her baptism, she\
began preparation to\
10:28\
receive a temple recommend.\
10:31\
Lydia attended the Freiburg\
Germany Temple to receive her\
10:34\
endowment and then spent several\
days doing proxy work there.\
10:40\
Following the dedication of the\
Kiev Ukraine Temple, Lydia\
10:44\
attended the temple more\
frequently.\
10:47\
She and her husband, Anatoly, were\
eternally sealed\
10:49\
there and later called to serve as\
temple missionaries.\
10:53\
Together, they have found more\
than 15,000 names of ancestors\
11:00\
and have provided temple\
ordinances for them.\
11:05\
When asked about her feelings\
regarding temple work, Lydia\
11:08\
says, "What did I receive in the\
temple?\
11:11\
I have made new covenants with\
God.\
11:13\
My testimony has been\
strengthened.\
11:15\
I have learned to receive personal\
revelation.\
11:17\
I am able to perform saving\
ordinances for my deceased\
11:20\
ancestors, and I can love and\
serve other people." She\
11:24\
concluded with this very true\
statement: "The Lord wants to see\
11:29\
us in the temple often." I'm\
inspired by the goodness of these\
11:33\
Latter-day Saints, each with\
diverse backgrounds and\
11:37\
and varied in their lives,\
centered in these four stories.\
11:43\
Much can be learned from\
miraculous outcomes brought\
11:46\
through the simple application of\
simple gospel principles.\
11:51\
All they did is within our grasp\
as well.\
11:54\
May we keep the gospel simple as\
we take upon us our divinely\
11:58\
appointed responsibilities to live\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
12:03\
so as to be sensitive to the\
promptings as did Jens in Denmark.\
12:09\
To care for those in need, as\
demonstrated by\
12:11\
the members of the Cuquita Stake\
in Colombia in providing shelter\
12:16\
to orphaned ward members.\
12:19\
To invite all to receive the\
gospel in the way that\
12:21\
Cleiton from the African country\
of Cape Verde did with his\
12:26\
friends and family.\
12:29\
Finally, to unite families for\
eternity, as exemplified by\
12:33\
Lydia from Ukraine through her own\
temple ordinances, family\
12:37\
history efforts, and service in\
the temple.\
12:41\
Doing so will surely bring joy and\
peace.\
12:44\
Of this I promise and testify, and\
of Jesus Christ\
12:49\
as our Savior and our Redeemer.\
12:52\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
