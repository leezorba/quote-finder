Heavenly Father's plan of\
happiness includes a mortal\
0:05\
experience where all of His\
children\
0:07\
will be tested and face\
trials.\
0:10\
Five years ago, I was diagnosed\
with cancer.\
0:14\
I have felt and still feel the\
physical pains from\
0:17\
surgeries, radiation treatments,\
and medication side effects.\
0:22\
I have experienced emotional\
struggles during\
0:25\
torturous, sleepless nights.\
0:28\
Medical statistics indicate I will\
probably depart mortality\
0:32\
earlier than I ever expected,\
leaving behind for\
0:36\
a season of family who means\
everything to me.\
0:40\
Regardless of where you live,\
physical or emotional\
0:43\
suffering from a variety of trials\
and mortal weaknesses has\
0:48\
been, is now, or will someday be\
part of your life.\
0:54\
Physical suffering can result from\
natural aging, unexpected\
0:57\
diseases, and random accidents;\
hunger\
1:00\
or homelessness; or abuse, violent\
acts, and war.\
1:06\
Emotional suffering can arise from\
anxiety or\
1:08\
depression; the betrayal of a\
spouse, parent or trusted\
1:13\
leader; employment or financial\
reversals; unfair judgment by\
1:18\
others; the choices of friends,\
children, or other\
1:22\
family members; abuse in its many\
forms; unfulfilled dreams of\
1:27\
marriage or children; the severe\
illness or early death of loved\
1:32\
ones; or so many other sources.\
1:36\
How can you possibly endure the\
unique and sometimes\
1:40\
debilitating suffering that comes\
to each of us?\
1:44\
Gratefully, hope is found in the\
gospel of Jesus\
1:47\
Christ, and hope can also be part\
of your life.\
1:52\
Today, I share four principles of\
hope drawn from\
1:54\
scripture, prophetic teachings,\
many ministering\
1:57\
visits, and my own ongoing health\
trial.\
2:01\
These principles are not just\
broadly applicable but also\
2:06\
deeply personal.\
2:08\
First, suffering does not mean God\
is displeased with your life.\
2:14\
Two thousand years ago, Jesus's\
disciples saw a blind man at\
2:17\
the temple and asked, "Master, who\
did sin, this man\
2:22\
or his parents, that he was born\
blind?" His disciples seem to\
2:26\
incorrectly believe, as do far too\
many people today, that all\
2:31\
hardship and suffering in life are\
the result of sin.\
2:35\
But the Savior replied, "Neither\
hath this man send nor his\
2:39\
parents: but that the works of God\
should be made manifest in\
2:43\
him." The work of God is to bring\
to pass our immortality\
2:48\
and eternal life.\
2:50\
But how can trials and suffering,\
especially\
2:53\
suffering imposed by another\
person's sinful use of\
2:56\
agency, ultimately advance God's\
work?\
3:01\
The Lord told His covenant people,\
"I have refined\
3:04\
thee; I have chosen thee in the\
furnace of affliction."\
3:09\
Whatever the cause of your\
sufferings, your loving Heavenly\
3:13\
Father can direct them to refine\
your soul.\
3:17\
Refined souls can bear others'\
burdens with true empathy\
3:21\
and compassion.\
3:22\
Refined souls who have come "out\
of great tribulation" are\
3:26\
prepared to joyfully live in God's\
presence forever, and God\
3:30\
shall wipe away all tears from\
their eyes.\
3:34\
Second,\
3:35\
Heavenly Father is intimately\
aware of your suffering.\
3:40\
While in the midst of trials, we\
can mistakenly think\
3:43\
that God is far away and\
unconcerned with our pain.\
3:48\
Even the Prophet Joseph Smith\
expressed this feeling at a low\
3:51\
point in his life when imprisoned\
in Liberty Jail while thousands\
3:55\
of Latter-day Saints were being\
driven from their homes.\
3:58\
Joseph sought understanding\
through prayer:\
4:02\
â€œO God, where art Thou?\
4:04\
And where is the pavilion that\
covereth Thy hiding place?" He\
4:10\
ended with this plea: "Remember\
Thy sufferings saints, O, our\
4:15\
God." The Lord's answer reassured\
Joseph and all who\
4:20\
suffer: "My son, peace be unto thy\
soul; thine adversity\
4:25\
and thine afflictions shall be but\
a small moment; and\
4:29\
then, if thou endure it well, God\
shall exalt the\
4:33\
on high." Many suffering Saints\
have shared with me how they felt\
4:38\
God's love during their trials.\
4:41\
I vividly recall my own experience\
at one point in my\
4:44\
cancer battle, when the doctors\
had not yet diagnosed the cause\
4:48\
of some severe pain.\
4:50\
I sat with my wife\
4:52\
intending to offer a routine\
blessing on our lunch.\
4:55\
Instead, all I could do was simply\
weep: "Heavenly\
4:59\
Father, please help me.\
5:01\
I am so sick." For the next 20 to\
30 seconds, I was encircled in\
5:07\
His love.\
5:08\
I was given no reason for my\
illness, no indication of\
5:12\
the ultimate outcome, and no\
relief from the pain.\
5:16\
I just felt of His pure love, and\
that was and is enough.\
5:22\
I witnessed that our Heavenly\
Father, who notes the fall of\
5:26\
even a single sparrow, is aware of\
your suffering.\
5:31\
Third, Jesus Christ offers His\
enabling power to help you have\
5:35\
strength to endure your suffering\
well.\
5:39\
This enabling power is made\
possible through his Atonement.\
5:43\
I fear that too many Church\
members think if they are just\
5:47\
a little tougher,\
5:48\
they can get through any\
suffering on their own.\
5:51\
This is a hard way to live.\
5:53\
Your temporary moment of strength\
can never compare to\
5:57\
the Savior's infinite supply of\
power to fortify your soul.\
6:03\
The Book of Mormon teaches that\
Jesus Christ would take upon Him\
6:07\
our pains, sicknesses, and\
infirmities so He can succor us.\
6:12\
How can you draw upon the power\
that Jesus Christ offers to\
6:16\
succor you and strengthen you in\
times of suffering?\
6:21\
The key is binding yourself to the\
Savior by keeping\
6:24\
the covenants you have made with\
Him.\
6:27\
We make these covenants as we\
receive priesthood ordinances.\
6:32\
The people of Alma entered into\
the covenant of baptism.\
6:36\
Later, they suffered in bondage\
and were forbidden to worship\
6:38\
publicly or even pray aloud.\
6:41\
Yet they kept their covenants the\
best they could by crying out\
6:45\
silently in their hearts.\
6:47\
As a result, divine power came.\
6:50\
"The Lord did strengthen them that\
they could bear up their\
6:53\
burdens with ease." In our day,\
the Savior invites, "Look\
6:58\
unto me and every thought; doubt\
not, fear not."\
7:02\
When we keep our sacrament\
covenant to always remember\
7:04\
Him, He promises that His Spirit\
will be with us.\
7:09\
The Spirit gives us strength to\
endure trials and do what we\
7:13\
cannot possibly do on our own.\
7:15\
The Spirit can heal us, although\
as President James E.\
7:19\
Phelps taught, "Some of this\
healing may take\
7:23\
place in another world."\
7:26\
We are also blessed by temple\
covenants and ordinances where\
7:29\
"the power of godliness is\
manifest." I visited a woman who\
7:34\
had lost a teenage daughter in a\
terrible accident, then later\
7:38\
her husband to cancer.\
7:39\
I asked How could she endure such\
loss and suffering?\
7:44\
She replied that strength came\
from spiritual reassurances of\
7:48\
an eternal family received during\
regular temple worship.\
7:53\
As promised, the ordinances of the\
Lord's house had armed her\
7:58\
with God's power.\
8:01\
Fourth, choose to find joy each\
day.\
8:06\
Those who suffer often feel that\
the night just goes on and\
8:09\
on, and daylight will never come.\
8:13\
It is OK to weep.\
8:16\
Yet, if you find yourself in dark\
nights of suffering by choosing\
8:21\
faith, you can awake to bright\
mornings of rejoicing.\
8:26\
For example, I visited a young\
mother being treated for\
8:29\
cancer, smiling majestically in\
her chair despite the pain and\
8:34\
a lack of hair.\
8:35\
I met a middle-aged couple happily\
serving as youth leaders\
8:39\
though they were unable to\
conceive children, I sat with\
8:43\
a dear woman- a young grandmother,\
mother,\
8:47\
and wife-who would pass away\
within days, yet amid\
8:51\
the family's tears were laughter\
and joyful recollections.\
8:57\
These suffering saints exemplify\
what President Russell M.\
9:00\
Nelson has taught: "The joy we\
feel has little to do with\
9:04\
the circumstances of our lives and\
everything to do with\
9:09\
the focus of our lives.\
9:11\
When the focus of our lives is on\
God's plan of salvation\
9:14\
and Jesus Christ and his gospel,\
we can feel joy\
9:18\
regardless of what is happening or\
not happening in our lives."\
9:23\
I testify that our Heavenly Father\
remembers His suffering\
9:27\
Saints, loves you, and is\
intimately aware of you.\
9:31\
Our Savior knows how you feel.\
9:33\
"Surely he has borne our grief,\
and carried our sorrows."\
9:38\
I know-as a daily recipient-\
keeping covenant unlocks\
9:43\
the power of Jesus Christ's\
atoning sacrifice to provide\
9:47\
strength atoning sacrifice to\
provide strength and even joy to\
9:49\
you who suffer.\
9:51\
For all who suffer, I pray, "May\
God grant unto you\
9:55\
that your burdens may be light,\
through the joy of His\
9:58\
Son." In the name of Jesus Christ,\
amen.\
