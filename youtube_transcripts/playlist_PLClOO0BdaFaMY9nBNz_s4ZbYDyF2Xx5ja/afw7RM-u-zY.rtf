When I turned 15 years old, I\
received a learner's\
0:04\
permit, which allowed me to drive\
a car if one of my parents was\
0:07\
with me.\
0:09\
When my father asked if I would\
love to like to go for a\
0:11\
drive, I was thrilled.\
0:13\
He drove a few miles to the\
outskirts of town to a\
0:16\
long, straight two-lane road that\
few people used.\
0:20\
I should note, likely the only\
place he would have felt safe.\
0:23\
He pulled over on the shoulder of\
the road, and we switched seats.\
0:27\
He gave me some coaching and then\
told me, "Ease out onto\
0:30\
the road, and just drive until I\
tell you to stop." I followed\
0:34\
his orders exactly, but after\
about 60 seconds, he\
0:38\
said: "Son, pull the car over.\
0:40\
You're making me nauseous." You're\
swerving all over\
0:44\
the road.\
0:45\
He asked, "What are you looking\
at?" With some\
0:49\
exasperation, I said, "I'm looking\
at the road." Then he\
0:52\
said this: "I'm watching your\
eyes, and you were only looking\
0:57\
at what is right in front of the\
hood of the car.\
1:01\
If you only look at what is\
directly in front of you, you\
1:04\
will never drive straight." Then,\
he emphasized, "Look down\
1:09\
the road.\
1:10\
That will help you drive\
straight." As a 15 year\
1:14\
old, I thought that was a good\
driving lesson.\
1:16\
I have since realized that that\
was a great life lesson as well.\
1:20\
Focusing on the things that are\
most important, especially those\
1:24\
things down the road, those\
eternal things, is a key to\
1:28\
maneuvering through this life.\
1:32\
On one occasion in the Savior's\
life, He desired to be alone.\
1:37\
"So He went up into a mountain\
apart to pray." He sent his\
1:41\
disciples away with instructions\
to cross the sea.\
1:44\
In the dark of the night,\
1:46\
the ship that carried the\
disciples came upon\
1:48\
a ferocious storm.\
1:50\
Jesus went to the rescue but in an\
unconventional way.\
1:55\
The scripture account reads, "In\
the fourth watch of\
1:59\
the night, Jesus went unto them\
walking on the sea." When they\
2:06\
saw him, they began to fear, for\
they thought that\
2:08\
the figure that approached them\
was some sort of ghost\
2:11\
or phantom.\
2:13\
Jesus, sensing their trepidation\
and wanting to put their minds\
2:17\
and hearts at ease, called to\
them, "Be of good cheer; it is\
2:22\
I; be not afraid." Peter was not\
only relieved but also emboldened.\
2:29\
Ever courageous and often\
impetuous.\
2:32\
Peter cried out to Jesus, "Lord,\
if it be thou, bid me come\
2:36\
on to thee on the water." Jesus\
replied with his familiar\
2:41\
and timeless invitation: "Come."\
Peter, surely thrilled by\
2:47\
the prospect, climbed out of the\
boat, not into the water\
2:50\
but onto the water.\
2:52\
While he focused on the Savior, he\
could do\
2:55\
the impossible, even walk on\
water.\
2:59\
Initially, Peter was undeterred by\
the storm, but the boisterous\
3:03\
wind eventually distracted him,\
and he lost his focus.\
3:08\
The fear returned.\
3:10\
Consequently, his faith\
diminished, and he began to sink.\
3:15\
He cried, saying, "Lord, save me."\
The Savior, who is always\
3:20\
eager to save, reached out and\
lifted him up to safety.\
3:26\
There are myriad of lessons to\
learn from this miraculous\
3:29\
account, but I will mention three.\
3:32\
The first lesson: focus on Jesus\
Christ.\
3:37\
While Peter kept his eyes focused\
on Jesus, he could walk on water.\
3:41\
The storm, the waves and the wind\
could not hinder him\
3:45\
as long as he centered his focus\
on the Savior.\
3:49\
Understanding our ultimate purpose\
helps us to determine\
3:53\
what our focus should be.\
3:55\
We cannot play a successful game\
without knowing the goal,\
3:58\
nor can we live a meaningful life\
without knowing its purpose.\
4:03\
One of the great blessings of the\
restored gospel of Jesus\
4:06\
Christ is that it answers, among\
other\
4:09\
things, the question What is the\
purpose of life?\
4:13\
Our purpose in this life is to\
have joy and prepare to return to\
4:19\
God's presence.\
4:21\
Remembering that we are here on\
earth to prepare to return to\
4:24\
live with God helps us focus on\
the things that lead us to Christ.\
4:29\
Focusing on Christ requires\
discipline, especially about\
4:33\
the small and simple spiritual\
habits\
4:35\
that help us become better\
disciples.\
4:39\
There is no discipleship without\
discipline.\
4:43\
Our focus on Christ becomes more\
clear when we look down the road\
4:46\
at where we want to be and who we\
want to become and then make time\
4:51\
every day to do those things that\
will help us get there.\
4:55\
Focusing on Christ can simplify\
our decisions and provide\
4:59\
a guide for how we best spend our\
time and resources.\
5:03\
While there are many things worthy\
of our focus, we learned\
5:05\
from Peter's example the\
importance of always keeping\
5:09\
Christ at the center of our focus.\
5:13\
It is only through Christ that we\
can return to live with God.\
5:17\
We rely on the grace of Christ as\
we strive to become like Him\
5:21\
and seek his forgiveness and\
strengthening power when we\
5:25\
fall short.\
5:27\
The second lesson: beware of\
distractions.\
5:31\
When Peter turned his focus away\
from Jesus and toward the wind\
5:34\
and the waves that whipped at his\
feet, he began to sink.\
5:38\
There are many things in front of\
the hood that can distract us\
5:42\
from focusing on Christ and\
eternal things that are down\
5:45\
the road.\
5:46\
The devil is the great distractor.\
5:49\
We learned from Lehi's dream that\
voices from the great\
5:52\
and spacious building seek to lure\
us to things that will take\
5:55\
us off the course of preparing to\
return to live with God.\
6:00\
But there are other less-obvious\
distractions that can be just\
6:03\
as dangerous.\
6:05\
As the saying goes, "The only\
thing necessary for the triumph\
6:09\
of evil is for good men to do\
nothing.\
6:13\
The adversary seems determined to\
get good people to do\
6:17\
nothing, or at least to waste\
their time on things that will\
6:21\
distract them from their lofty\
purposes and goals.\
6:25\
For example, some things that are\
healthy diversions\
6:27\
in moderation can become\
unhealthy distractions\
6:32\
without discipline.\
6:34\
The adversary understands\
distractions do not have to be\
6:37\
bad or immoral to be effective.\
6:42\
The third lesson: we can be\
rescued.\
6:46\
When Peter began to sink, he cried\
out, "Lord, save me.\
6:51\
and immediately Jesus stretched\
forth his hand and caught him.\
6:56\
When we find ourselves sinking,\
when we face\
6:59\
affliction, or when we falter, And\
the\
7:04\
face of affliction or trial, you\
may be like me\
7:07\
and hope that the rescue will be\
immediate.\
7:10\
But remember that the Savior came\
to the aid of the Apostles in\
7:14\
the fourth watch of the night\
after they had spent most of\
7:18\
the night toiling in the storm.\
7:20\
We may pray that if the help will\
not come immediately, it will at\
7:23\
least come in the second watch or\
even the third watch of\
7:27\
the proverbial night.\
7:29\
When we must wait, rest assured\
that the Savior is always\
7:33\
watching, Ensuring that we will\
not have to endure more than we\
7:38\
can bear To those who are waiting\
in the fourth watch of\
7:43\
the night, perhaps still in the\
midst of suffering.\
7:46\
Do not lose hope.\
7:48\
Rescue always comes to the\
faithful, whether during\
7:52\
mortality or in the eternities.\
7:56\
Sometimes our sinking comes\
because of our mistakes\
7:58\
and transgressions.\
8:00\
If you find yourself sinking for\
those reasons, make\
8:03\
the joyful choice to repent.\
8:06\
I believe that few things give the\
Savior more joy than saving\
8:11\
those who turn or return to Him.\
8:15\
The scriptures are full of stories\
of people who were once\
8:18\
fallen and flawed but who repented\
and became firm in\
8:22\
the faith of Christ.\
8:24\
I think those stories are in their\
scriptures to remind us\
8:26\
that the Saviorâ€™s love\
8:29\
for us and His power to\
redeem us are infinite.\
8:32\
Not only does the Savior have joy\
when we repent, but we receive\
8:36\
great joy as well.\
8:39\
I invite you to be intentional\
about looking down the road\
8:42\
and increase your focus on those\
things that really matter.\
8:46\
May we keep Christ at the center\
of our focus and the midst of all\
8:51\
the distractions, the things in\
front of the hood and\
8:53\
the whirlwind that surround us.\
8:56\
I testify that Jesus is our Savior\
and our Redeemer and our rescuer.\
9:02\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
