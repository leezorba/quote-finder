Beginning in 1946, thousands of\
pioneers-men, women,\
0:06\
and children-headed Westward, to\
Zion.\
0:09\
Their great faith steered their\
boundless courage.\
0:12\
For some, that trip was never\
finished as they died along\
0:16\
the way.\
0:17\
Others, facing adversity, pressed\
forward in faith.\
0:23\
Because of them, generations\
later, my family enjoyed\
0:27\
the blessing of the true gospel of\
Jesus Christ.\
0:30\
Much like another young man who I\
will mention later, I was\
0:35\
fourteen when I started to\
question religion and my faith.\
0:39\
I attended the Church of another\
denomination close to my\
0:43\
house, but I felt the desire to\
visit many different churches.\
0:48\
One afternoon, I noticed two young\
men in their suits\
0:51\
and white shirts enter into my\
neighbor's home.\
0:55\
Those young men looked special.\
0:58\
The next day, I asked my next door\
neighbor, Leonor\
1:01\
Lopez, and asked her about those\
two men.\
1:06\
Leonor explained to me that they\
were missionaries of the Church\
1:11\
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints.\
1:14\
She joyfully told me that her\
family was baptized in\
1:18\
the Church a year earlier.\
1:20\
Seeing my interest, Leonor invited\
me to meet\
1:24\
the missionaries and learn about\
the Church.\
1:28\
Two days later, I joined the Lopez\
family to meet\
1:31\
the missionaries.\
1:33\
They introduced themselves as John\
Messily from Ogden, Utah,\
1:38\
and Christopher Osorio from\
[INAUDIBLE], California.\
1:42\
I will never forget them.\
1:45\
Since I was only fourteen, Elder\
Messily insisted\
1:48\
we go next door to my home so my\
mother could know what they were\
1:53\
teaching me.\
1:55\
There, he kindly explained that\
they came to share a message\
1:59\
about Jesus Christ and ask for her\
permission to teach me.\
2:05\
Mother agreed, and even joined us\
while they taught me.\
2:10\
The missionaries first asked\
Leonor to offer a prayer.\
2:16\
This touched me very deeply\
because her prayer was not\
2:19\
a repetition of memorized words,\
but an expression of her heart.\
2:25\
I felt she was really talking to\
her Heavenly Father.\
2:30\
The missionaries then taught us\
about Jesus Christ.\
2:34\
They showed a picture of Him that\
impressed me because it was\
2:38\
the picture of the resurrected,\
living Christ.\
2:43\
They continue teaching us of how\
Jesus established His Church in\
2:48\
ancient times with Him at the\
head, joined by Twelve Apostles.\
2:53\
They taught us about apostasy, how\
truth and Christ's\
2:56\
authority had been taken from the\
Earth after His Apostles died.\
3:02\
They told us of a young 14-year-\
old boy named Joseph\
3:07\
Smith, who, during the early 1800s\
visited different churches\
3:12\
searching for truth.\
3:14\
As time went on, Joseph Smith\
became even more confused.\
3:20\
After reading in the Bible that\
3:25\
we can ask of God for wisdom,\
Joseph, acting in\
3:29\
faith, retired to a grove of trees\
and prayed which church he\
3:35\
should join.\
3:37\
One of the missionaries read\
Joseph Smith's account of what\
3:40\
happened as he prayed.\
3:43\
"I saw a pillar of light exactly\
over my head, above\
3:48\
the brightness of the sun, which\
descended gradually\
3:52\
until it fell upon me.\
3:54\
When the light rested upon me, I\
saw two personages whose\
3:59\
brightness and glory defied all\
description,\
4:03\
standing above me in\
the air.\
4:06\
One of them spake unto me, calling\
me by my\
4:09\
name, and said, pointing to the\
other, "This is my Beloved Son.\
4:15\
Hear Him."" During that lesson,\
the Spirit confirmed to\
4:20\
me several truths.\
4:22\
First, God listens to all His\
children's sincere\
4:26\
prayers, and heaven is open to\
all, not just a few.\
4:33\
Second, God the Father, Jesus\
Christ, and the Holy Ghost are\
4:38\
three separate beings united in\
their purpose to bring to pass\
4:43\
the immortality and eternal life\
of man.\
4:46\
Third, we are created in God's\
image.\
4:49\
Our Heavenly Father and His Son,\
Jesus Christ, have bodies of\
4:54\
flesh and bone, like us, but they\
are glorified\
4:57\
and perfected, and the Holy Ghost\
is a person of spirit.\
5:02\
Fourth, through Joseph Smith,\
Jesus Christ restored\
5:07\
the gospel and true Church to the\
Earth.\
5:10\
The priesthood authority conferred\
on Christ's Apostles\
5:14\
2,000 years ago is the same\
priesthood authority conferred\
5:19\
upon Joseph Smith and Oliver\
Cowdery by Peter, James,\
5:25\
and John.\
5:26\
Finally, we learned about another\
testament of Jesus\
5:31\
Christ, The Book of Mormon.\
5:33\
Written by ancient Prophets, it\
tells of the people\
5:37\
who lived in the Americas before,\
during, and after\
5:41\
the birth of Jesus.\
5:43\
From it we learn of how they knew,\
loved, and worshipped\
5:47\
Christ, who appeared to them as\
their resurrected Savior.\
5:53\
The Spirit moved me profoundly as\
I learned of the Savior's\
5:58\
declaration to them: "Behold, I am\
Jesus\
6:02\
Christ, whom the Prophets\
testified shall come into\
6:06\
the world.‚Äù\
6:07\
The missionaries gave us our own\
copy of the Book of Mormon.\
6:12\
We read and accepted the\
invitation found at the end\
6:16\
of the Book of Mormon, which\
reads, "And when ye shall receive\
6:20\
these things, I would exhort you\
that ye would ask God,\
6:25\
the Eternal Father, in the name of\
Christ, if these things are\
6:29\
not true.\
6:30\
And if ye shall ask with a sincere\
heart, with real\
6:35\
intent, having faith in Christ, He\
will manifest\
6:39\
the truth of it unto you by the\
power of the Holy\
6:43\
Ghost, and by the power of the\
Holy Ghost, ye may know\
6:47\
the truth of all things." It has\
been almost forty-five years\
6:53\
since my mother and I first\
learned the joy and power of\
6:58\
having faith in Christ.\
7:01\
It was because of their faith in\
Christ that the Lopez family\
7:06\
shared their new faith with me.\
7:09\
It was because of their faith in\
Christ that these two\
7:12\
missionaries left their homes in\
the United States to find my\
7:19\
mother and me.\
7:22\
It was the faith of all those dear\
friends that planted\
7:25\
a mustard seed of faith in us that\
has grown into a mighty tree\
7:33\
of eternal blessings.\
7:36\
During these blessed years, we\
have known,\
7:40\
as President Nelson, Russel M.\
7:42\
Nelson declared, "everything good\
in life, every potential blessing\
7:48\
of eternal significance, begins\
with faith.\
7:52\
Allowing God to prevail in our\
lives begins with faith that He\
7:57\
is willing to guide us.\
7:59\
True repentance begins with faith\
that Jesus Christ has the power\
8:05\
to cleanse, heal, and strengthen\
us." I'd invite us all to\
8:12\
continually increase our faith in\
Christ, who has changed the life\
8:17\
of my beloved mother and me, and\
continues to change\
8:21\
the lives of all those who seek\
Him.\
8:24\
I know that Joseph Smith is the\
Prophet of the\
8:27\
Restoration, the President Nelson\
is our Prophet today, that Jesus\
8:33\
is our living Christ and our\
Redeemer, and that Heavenly\
8:37\
Father lives and answers all His\
children's prayers.\
8:42\
I testify of this truth in the\
sacred name of Jesus\
8:46\
Christ, amen.\
