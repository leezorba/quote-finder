In my professional life and in my\
service in the Church, I have\
0:05\
done this thousands of times, just\
never before the 15\
0:10\
men seated directly behind me.\
0:13\
I feel your prayers and theirs.\
0:17\
Brothers and sisters, I am a\
native of the Kingdom of Tonga\
0:20\
in the South Pacific but was\
raised in North America.\
0:24\
The pandemic has kept hundreds,\
perhaps\
0:26\
thousands, of young Tongan\
missionaries serving around\
0:29\
the world from returning to their\
beloved homeland because of its\
0:34\
closed borders.\
0:36\
Some Tongan elders have been on\
their missions for three\
0:40\
years, and sisters over two years.\
0:44\
They wait patiently with the faith\
for which our people\
0:46\
are known.\
0:49\
Meanwhile, don't be too alarmed if\
some of them serving in your\
0:52\
wards and stakes are looking\
increasingly more like\
0:55\
me: aging and gray.\
1:00\
We are grateful for missionaries\
everywhere, for their devoted\
1:03\
service, even when longer or\
shorter than they had\
1:07\
anticipated because of the\
pandemic.\
1:11\
One Sunday, when I was a deacon, I\
was in the foyer with\
1:13\
a tray of water passing the\
sacrament when a woman had\
1:16\
just walked into the building.\
1:19\
Dutifully, I approached and I\
handed her the tray.\
1:22\
She nodded, smiled, and took a cup\
of water.\
1:26\
She had arrived too late to\
receive the bread.\
1:29\
Shortly after this experience, my\
home\
1:31\
teacher, Ned Brimley, taught me\
that many aspects and blessings\
1:36\
of the gospel of Jesus Christ are\
given to us in sequential order.\
1:41\
Later that week, Ned Brimley and\
his companion came to our\
1:44\
home with a memorable lesson.\
1:47\
Ned reminded us that there was\
order to how God created\
1:50\
the earth.\
1:52\
And the Lord took great care in\
explaining to Moses the order in\
1:56\
which he created the earth.\
1:58\
First, he started by dividing the\
light from the darkness\
2:01\
and then water from the dry land.\
2:04\
He added plant life and animals\
before introducing to the newly\
2:08\
formed planet His greatest\
creation, humankind, beginning\
2:12\
with Adam and Eve.\
2:15\
"So God created man in his own\
image, in the image of God\
2:18\
created he him; male and female\
created he them.\
2:24\
And God saw every thing that he\
had made, and, behold, it was\
2:27\
very good." The Lord was pleased,\
and He rested on\
2:31\
the seventh day.\
2:34\
The sequential order in which the\
earth was created not only\
2:37\
gives us a glimpse of what is most\
important to God but also\
2:41\
why and for whom He created the\
earth.\
2:45\
Ned Brimley punctuated his\
inspired lesson with a simple\
2:48\
statement: "Vai, God's house is\
one of order.\
2:54\
He expects you to live your life\
with order, in proper sequence.\
3:00\
He wants you to serve a mission\
before you get married." To this\
3:03\
point, Church leaders currently\
teach that the Lord expects each\
3:07\
able young man to prepare to\
serve.\
3:09\
Young women who desire to serve\
should also prepare.\
3:13\
Brother Brimley continued, "God\
wants you to get\
3:16\
married before you have children,\
and he wants you to\
3:21\
continually develop your talents\
as you earn an education.\
3:25\
If you choose to live your life\
out of sequence, you will find\
3:29\
life more difficult and chaotic."\
Brother Brimley\
3:33\
also taught us that through His\
atoning sacrifice, the Savior\
3:37\
helps us to restore order to our\
lives made chaotic or out of\
3:41\
sequence by our own or others'\
poor choices.\
3:45\
From that time on, I've had a\
fascination with sequential order.\
3:51\
I developed a habit of looking for\
sequential patterns in life\
3:54\
and in the gospel.\
3:57\
Elder David A. Bednar taught this\
principle: “As we study,\
4:01\
learn, and live the gospel of\
Jesus Christ,\
4:04\
sequence often is instructive.\
4:07\
Consider, for example, the lessons\
we learn about\
4:10\
the spiritual priorities from the\
order of the major events\
4:13\
that occurred as the fulness of\
the Savior's gospel was restored\
4:17\
in these latter days." Elder\
Bednar listed the First Vision\
4:22\
and Moroni's initial appearance to\
Joseph Smith as teaching\
4:25\
the boy prophet, first, the nature\
and character of\
4:29\
God, followed by the role the Book\
of Mormon and Elijah\
4:33\
would play in gathering Israel on\
both sides of the veil in this\
4:37\
last dispensation.\
4:39\
Elder Bednar concludes, "This\
inspiring sequence is instructive\
4:44\
about the spiritual matters of\
4:46\
highest priority to Deity." Close\
quote.\
4:50\
One observation I've made is that\
sequential order is a\
4:53\
simple, natural, and effective way\
for the Lord to teach\
4:56\
us, as His children, important\
principles.\
5:00\
We've come to earth to learn and\
gain experience we would not\
5:03\
otherwise have.\
5:04\
Our growth is unique to each of us\
individually and a vital\
5:08\
component of Heavenly Father's\
plan.\
5:11\
Our physical and spiritual growth\
begins in stages and develops\
5:14\
slowly as we gain experience\
sequentially.\
5:20\
Alma gives a powerful sermon on\
faith, drawing on the analogy\
5:23\
of a seed, which, if tended and\
nourished properly, sprouts\
5:28\
from a small sapling into a\
full-grown, mature tree that\
5:32\
produces delicious fruit.\
5:35\
The lesson is that your faith will\
increase as you give place\
5:38\
for and nourish the seed, or the\
word of God, in your hearts.\
5:43\
Your faith will increase as the\
word of God begins to "swell\
5:47\
within your breasts." That it\
"swelleth, and sprouteth,\
5:51\
and beginneth to grow" is both\
visual and instructive.\
5:55\
It is also sequential.\
5:59\
The Lord teaches us individually,\
according to our\
6:01\
capacity, to learn and how we\
learn.\
6:04\
Our growth is entirely dependent\
on our willingness, our natural\
6:08\
curiosity, our level of faith and\
understanding.\
6:12\
Nephi was taught what Joseph Smith\
would learn in\
6:15\
Kirtland, Ohio, over 2,300 years\
later: "For\
6:19\
behold, thus saith the Lord...\
6:21\
: I will give unto the children of\
men line upon line, precept\
6:25\
upon precept, here a little[,]\
there a little;\
6:29\
and blessed are those who hearken\
unto my precepts, and lend\
6:32\
an ear unto my counsel, for they\
shall learn wisdom." That we\
6:37\
learn line upon line, precept upon\
precept, here a little\
6:41\
and there a little is again\
sequential.\
6:45\
Consider the following statements\
we've heard most of our\
6:47\
lives: "First things first" or\
"Feed them milk before meat."\
6:52\
How about "We have to walk before\
we run"?\
6:56\
Each of these axioms describes\
something that is sequential.\
7:00\
Miracles operate according to\
sequential order.\
7:04\
Miracles occur when we first\
exercise faith.\
7:07\
Faith precedes the miracle.\
7:11\
Aaronic Priesthood offices are\
also ordained in\
7:13\
sequence, according to the age of\
the one being ordained:\
7:17\
deacon, teacher, and then priest.\
7:20\
The ordinances of salvation and\
exaltation\
7:22\
are sequential in nature.\
7:25\
We are baptized prior to receiving\
the gift of the Holy Ghost.\
7:29\
Temple ordinances are sequential.\
7:32\
Similarly sequential, of course,\
as my friend Ned Brimley\
7:36\
so wisely taught me-- the\
sacrament is sequential.\
7:40\
It begins with the bread followed\
by the water.\
7:44\
"And as they were eating, Jesus\
took bread, and blessed\
7:47\
it, and brake it, and gave it to\
the disciples, and said,\
7:50\
Take, eat; this is my body.\
7:53\
And he took the cup, and gave\
thanks, and gave it to\
7:55\
them, saying, Drink ye all of it;\
for this is my blood of\
7:59\
the new testament, which is shed\
for many for the remission of\
8:02\
sins." In Jerusalem and in the\
Americas, the Savior\
8:07\
instituted the sacrament in the\
exact same order.\
8:12\
"Behold, mine house is a house of\
order, saith the Lord\
8:15\
God, and not a house of\
confusion.”\
8:18\
Repentance is sequential.\
8:20\
It begins with faith in Jesus\
Christ, even if just a particle.\
8:26\
Faith requires humility, which is\
an essential element of having\
8:29\
a broken heart and a contrite\
spirit.\
8:32\
Indeed, the first four principles\
of the gospel are sequential.\
8:36\
"We believe that the first\
principles and ordinances of\
8:39\
the Gospel are: first, Faith in\
the Lord Jesus Christ;\
8:43\
second, Repentance; third, Baptism\
by immersion\
8:47\
for the remission of sins; fourth,\
Laying on of hands\
8:51\
for the gift of the Holy Ghost."\
King Benjamin taught his people\
8:55\
this important truth: "And see\
that all these things are done in\
8:58\
wisdom and order; for it is not\
requisite that a man should run\
9:02\
faster than he has strength.\
9:04\
And again, it is expedient that he\
should be diligent, that\
9:08\
thereby he might win the prize;\
therefore, all things must\
9:13\
be done in order." May we live our\
lives with order and seek to\
9:18\
follow the sequence the Lord has\
outlined for us.\
9:22\
We will be blessed as we look for\
and follow the patterns\
9:26\
and the sequence in which the Lord\
teaches what's most\
9:30\
important to Him.\
9:31\
In the sacred name of Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
