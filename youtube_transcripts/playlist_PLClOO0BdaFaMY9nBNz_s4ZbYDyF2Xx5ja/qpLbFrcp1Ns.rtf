I begin by posing several\
questions meant\
0:05\
for self-reflection.\
0:07\
What kind of personal narrative\
are you writing for your life?\
0:11\
Is the path you describe in your\
story straight?\
0:14\
Does your story end where it\
began, at your heavenly home?\
0:18\
Is there an exemplar in your\
story, and is it the\
0:22\
Savior, Jesus Christ?\
0:24\
I testify that the Savior is the\
author and finisher of our faith.\
0:30\
Will you invite Him to be the\
author and finisher of your story?\
0:35\
He knows the beginning from the\
end.\
0:37\
He was the Creator of heaven and\
earth.\
0:39\
He wants us to return home to Him\
and our Heavenly Father.\
0:43\
He has everything invested in us\
and wants us to succeed.\
0:49\
What do you suppose keeps us from\
turning our stories over to Him?\
0:54\
Perhaps this illustration will\
help your self-assessment.\
0:59\
An effective trial lawyer knows\
that on cross-examination you\
1:03\
should rarely ask a witness a\
question to which you do not\
1:07\
know the answer.\
1:09\
Asking such a question is inviting\
the witness to tell you\
1:13\
and the judge and jury something\
you don't already know.\
1:17\
You might get an answer that\
surprises you and is contrary to\
1:21\
the narrative you have developed\
for your case.\
1:25\
Although asking the witness a\
question to which you do not\
1:28\
know the answer is generally\
unwise for a trial\
1:31\
lawyer, the opposite is true for\
us.\
1:35\
We can ask questions of our loving\
Heavenly Father in\
1:38\
the name of our merciful Savior.\
1:40\
And the witness who answers our\
questions is the Holy\
1:43\
Ghost, who always testifies of\
truth.\
1:48\
Because the Holy Ghost works in\
perfect unity with Heavenly\
1:51\
Father and Jesus Christ, we know\
that the manifestations of\
1:55\
the Holy Ghost are reliable.\
1:58\
Why, then, are we sometimes\
resistant to asking for this kind\
2:01\
of heavenly help, truth manifest\
to us by the Holy Ghost?\
2:06\
Why do we put off asking a\
question to which we do not\
2:10\
know the answer, when the witness\
is not only friendly\
2:14\
but will always tell the truth?\
2:18\
Perhaps it is because we don't\
have the faith to accept\
2:20\
the answer we might receive.\
2:22\
Perhaps it is because the natural\
man or woman in us is\
2:25\
resistant to turning things\
completely over to the Lord\
2:29\
and trusting him entirely.\
2:32\
Maybe that is why we choose to\
stick with the narrative we have\
2:36\
written for ourselves, a\
comfortable version of our\
2:39\
story, unedited by the Master\
Author.\
2:44\
We don't want to ask a question\
and get an answer that doesn't\
2:47\
fit neatly into the story we are\
writing for ourselves.\
2:51\
Frankly, few of us would probably\
right into our stories\
2:55\
the trials that refine us, but\
don't we love\
2:58\
the glorious culmination of a\
story we read when\
3:01\
the protagonist overcomes the\
struggle?\
3:04\
Trials are the elements of the\
plot that make our favorite\
3:07\
stories compelling.\
3:09\
Timeless, faith-promoting, and\
worthy of\
3:11\
telling, the beautiful struggles\
written into our stories are what\
3:16\
draw us closer to the Savior and\
refine us, making us more\
3:21\
like Him.\
3:23\
For David to overcome Goliath, the\
boy had to take\
3:25\
on the giant.\
3:27\
The comfortable narrative for\
David would have been\
3:30\
a return to tending sheep.\
3:32\
But instead he reflected upon his\
experience saving lambs from\
3:37\
a lion and a bear, and building on\
those heroic feats he mustered\
3:41\
the faith and courage to let God\
write his story,\
3:45\
declaring, "The Lord that\
delivered me out of the paw of\
3:49\
the lion, and out of the paw of\
the bear, he will deliver me out\
3:52\
of the hand of this Philistine."\
With the desire to let God\
3:56\
prevail, with an ear to the Holy\
Ghost and a willingness to let\
3:59\
the Savior be the author and\
finisher of his\
4:02\
story, the boy David defeated\
Goliath and saved his people.\
4:09\
The sublime principle of agency\
does, of course, allow us to\
4:13\
write our own stories.\
4:15\
David could have gone home, back\
to tending sheep.\
4:19\
But Jesus Christ stands ready to\
use us as divine\
4:23\
instruments, sharpened pencils in\
His hand to write a masterpiece.\
4:28\
He is mercifully willing to use\
me, a scrawny pencil, as\
4:33\
an instrument in His hands if I\
have the faith to let\
4:36\
Him, if I will let Him author my\
story.\
4:42\
Esther is another beautiful\
example of letting God prevail.\
4:45\
Rather than sticking with the\
cautious narrative of\
4:48\
self-preservation, she exercised\
faith, turning herself completely\
4:53\
over to the Lord.\
4:54\
Haman was plotting the destruction\
of all the Jews in Persia.\
4:58\
Mordecai, Esther's relative,\
became aware of\
5:00\
the plot and wrote to her, urging\
her to talk with\
5:03\
the king on behalf of her people.\
5:06\
She recounted to him that one who\
approaches the king without being\
5:09\
summoned was subject to death.\
5:11\
But in a tremendous act of faith,\
she asked Mordecai to\
5:15\
gather the Jews and fast for her.\
5:18\
"I also and my maidens will fast\
likewise," she said, "and\
5:22\
so will I go in unto the king,\
which is not according to\
5:25\
the law: and if I perish, I\
perish." Esther was willing to\
5:30\
let the Savior write her story,\
even though through\
5:33\
the lens of mortality the ending\
may have been tragic.\
5:38\
Blessedly, the king received\
Esther and the Jews in Persia\
5:42\
were saved.\
5:43\
Of course, Esther's level of\
courage is rarely asked of\
5:46\
us, but letting God prevail,\
letting Him be\
5:49\
the author and finisher of our\
stories, does require us to keep\
5:53\
His commandments and the covenants\
we have made.\
5:57\
It is our commandment- and\
covenant-keeping that will\
6:00\
open the line of communication for\
us to receive revelation\
6:04\
through the Holy Ghost.\
6:06\
And it is through the\
manifestations of the Spirit\
6:09\
that we will feel the Master's\
hand writing our stories with us.\
6:14\
In April 2020, our prophet,\
President Russell M.\
6:18\
Nelson, asked us to consider what\
we could do if we had more faith\
6:23\
in Jesus Christ.\
6:25\
With more faith in Jesus Christ,\
we could ask a question\
6:28\
to which we do not know the\
answer.\
6:30\
Ask our Father in Heaven in the\
name of Jesus Christ to send\
6:34\
an answer through the Holy Ghost,\
who testifies of truth.\
6:39\
If we had more faith, we would ask\
the question and then be\
6:42\
willing to accept the answer we\
receive, even if it doesn't fit\
6:47\
our comfortable narrative.\
6:49\
And the promised blessing that\
will come from acting in faith in\
6:52\
Jesus Christ is an increase in\
faith in Him as our author\
6:56\
and finisher.\
6:58\
President Nelson declared that we\
receive more faith by doing\
7:02\
something that requires more\
faith.\
7:05\
So a childless couple suffering\
with infertility may ask in faith\
7:09\
whether they should adopt children\
and be willing to accept\
7:12\
the answer, even though the\
narrative they had written\
7:15\
for themselves included a\
miraculous birth.\
7:19\
A senior couple may ask whether it\
is time for them to\
7:21\
serve a mission and be willing to\
go, even though the narrative\
7:25\
they had written for themselves\
included more time in\
7:27\
the workforce.\
7:29\
Or maybe the answer will be "Not\
yet" and they will learn in later\
7:33\
chapters of their story\
7:34\
why they were needed at home\
a little bit longer.\
7:38\
A teenaged young man or young\
woman may ask in faith whether\
7:41\
a pursuit of sports or academics\
or music is the most value\
7:46\
and be willing to follow the\
promptings of the perfect\
7:49\
witness, the Holy Ghost.\
7:53\
Why do we want the Savior to be\
the author and the finisher of\
7:55\
our stories?\
7:57\
Because He knows our potential\
perfectly, He will take us to\
8:00\
places we never imagined\
ourselves.\
8:04\
He may make us a David or an\
Esther.\
8:07\
He will stretch us and refine us\
to be more like Him.\
8:11\
The things we will achieve as we\
act with more faith will increase\
8:15\
our faith in Jesus Christ.\
8:17\
Brothers and sisters, just one\
year ago our dear prophet\
8:21\
asked, "Are you willing to let God\
prevail\
8:24\
in your life? ...\
8:26\
Are you willing to let whatever He\
needs you to do take\
8:29\
precedence over every other\
ambition?" I humbly add to those\
8:35\
prophetic inquiries.\
8:37\
Will you let God be the author and\
finisher of your story?\
8:43\
In Revelation, we learn that we\
will stand before God and be\
8:46\
judged out of the books of life,\
according to our works.\
8:50\
We will be judged by our book of\
life.\
8:54\
We can choose to write a\
comfortable narrative\
8:56\
for ourselves, or we can allow the\
master author and finisher to\
9:01\
write our story with us, letting\
the role He needs us to play take\
9:06\
precedence over other ambitions.\
9:09\
Let Christ be the author and\
finisher of your story.\
9:12\
Let the Holy Ghost be your\
witness.\
9:15\
Write a story in which the path\
you are on is straight, on\
9:18\
a course leading you back to your\
heavenly home to live in\
9:21\
the presence of God.\
9:23\
Let the adversity and affliction\
that's part of every good story\
9:27\
be a means by which you draw\
closer to and become more like\
9:30\
Jesus Christ.\
9:32\
Tell a story in which you\
recognize the heavens are open.\
9:36\
Ask questions to which you do not\
know the answer, knowing God is\
9:39\
willing to make known His will for\
you through the Holy Ghost.\
9:43\
Let your narrative be one of faith\
following your\
9:46\
Exemplar, the Savior Jesus Christ.\
9:50\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
