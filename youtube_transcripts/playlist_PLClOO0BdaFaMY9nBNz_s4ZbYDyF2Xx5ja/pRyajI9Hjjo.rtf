I once sent a message to my\
daughter and son-in-law using\
0:05\
the voice-to-text feature on my\
phone.\
0:08\
I said, "Hey, you two.\
0:11\
Sure love you." They received,\
"Hate you two.\
0:15\
Should love you."\
0:20\
Isn't it amazing how easily a\
positive and well-intentioned\
0:25\
message can be misunderstood?\
0:27\
This is what sometimes happens\
with God's messages of repentance\
0:32\
and worthiness.\
0:34\
Some mistakenly receive the\
message that repentance\
0:37\
and change are unnecessary.\
0:39\
God's message is that they are\
essential.\
0:43\
But doesn't God love us despite\
our shortcomings?\
0:46\
Of course.\
0:47\
He loves us perfectly.\
0:49\
I love my grandchildren,\
imperfections and all, but that\
0:53\
does not mean I don't want them to\
improve and become all they\
0:57\
can become.\
0:59\
God loves us as we are, but He\
also loves us too much to leave\
1:06\
us this way.\
1:09\
Growing up unto the Lord is what\
mortality is all about.\
1:13\
Change is what Christ's Atonement\
is all about.\
1:16\
Not only can Christ resurrect,\
cleanse,\
1:19\
console, and heal us, but through\
it all, He can\
1:24\
transform us to become more like\
Him.\
1:29\
Some mistakenly receive the\
message that repentance is\
1:32\
a one-time event.\
1:34\
God's message is that, as\
President Russell M.\
1:37\
Nelson has taught, "Repentance …\
is a process." We read in Preach\
1:43\
My Gospel, "Repentance and\
recovery may take\
1:46\
time," so forsaking sin and having\
"no more disposition\
1:51\
to do evil, but to do good\
continually”\
1:55\
are lifetime pursuits.\
1:58\
Life is like a cross-country road\
trip.\
2:01\
We can't reach our destination on\
one tank of gas.\
2:04\
We must refill the tank over and\
over.\
2:08\
Taking the sacrament is like\
pulling into the gas station.\
2:12\
As we repent and renew our\
covenants, we pledge our\
2:16\
willingness to keep the\
commandments, and God\
2:19\
and Christ bless us with the Holy\
Spirit.\
2:22\
In short, we promise to press\
forward on our journey, and God\
2:27\
and Christ promise to refill the\
tank.\
2:31\
Some mistakenly receive the\
message that they are not\
2:34\
worthy to participate fully in the\
gospel because they are not\
2:39\
completely free of bad habits.\
2:42\
God's message is that worthiness\
is not flawlessness.\
2:49\
Worthiness is being honest and\
trying.\
2:53\
We must be honest with God,\
priesthood leaders,\
2:56\
and others who love us, and we\
must strive to keep God's\
3:00\
commandments and never give up\
just because we slip up.\
3:06\
Elder Bruce C.\
3:07\
Hafen said that developing a\
Christlike character "requires\
3:12\
patience and persistence more than\
it requires flawlessness."\
3:19\
The Lord has said the gifts of the\
Spirit are "given for\
3:23\
the benefit of those who love me\
and keep all my\
3:26\
commandments, and him that seeketh\
so to do." One young man\
3:35\
I'll call Damon wrote: "Growing\
up, I struggled with pornography.\
3:41\
I always felt so ashamed that I\
could not get things right."\
3:46\
Each time Damon slipped, the pain\
of regret became\
3:49\
so intense he harshly judged\
himself to be unworthy of any\
3:54\
kind of grace, forgiveness, or\
additional\
3:58\
chances from God.\
4:00\
He said, "I decided I just\
deserved to feel terrible all\
4:04\
the time.\
4:05\
I figured God probably hated me\
because I wasn't willing to work\
4:09\
harder and get on top of this once\
and for all.\
4:13\
I would go a week and sometimes\
even a month, but then I would\
4:18\
relapse and think, 'I'll never be\
good enough.\
4:23\
So what's the use of even\
trying?'" At one such low\
4:27\
moment, Damon said to his\
priesthood leader, "Maybe\
4:32\
I should just stop coming to\
church.\
4:34\
I'm sick of being a hypocrite."\
His leader responded, "You're not\
4:40\
a hypocrite because you have a bad\
habit you are trying to break.\
4:44\
You are a hypocrite if you hide\
it, lie about it, or try to\
4:49\
convince yourself the Church has\
the problem for maintaining such\
4:54\
high standards.\
4:56\
Being honest about your actions\
and taking steps to move forward\
5:01\
is not being a hypocrite.\
5:03\
It is being a disciple."\
5:08\
This leader quoted Elder Richard\
G.\
5:10\
Scott, who taught, "The Lord sees\
weakness differently than He does\
5:16\
rebellion … When the Lord speaks\
of weaknesses, it is always with\
5:22\
mercy." That perspective gave\
Damon hope.\
5:28\
He realized God was not up there\
saying, "Damon blew it again."\
5:33\
Instead, He was probably saying,\
"Look how far Damon has\
5:39\
come." This young man finally\
stopped looking down in shame\
5:44\
or looking sideways for excuses\
and rationalizations.\
5:48\
He looked up for divine help, and\
he found it.\
5:53\
Damon said, "The only time I had\
turned to God in the past was to\
5:59\
ask for forgiveness.\
6:00\
But now I also ask for grace- His\
'enabling power.' I had never\
6:06\
done that before.\
6:08\
These days, I spend a lot less\
time hating myself for what\
6:12\
I have done and a lot more time\
loving Jesus for what He has\
6:19\
done." Considering how long Damon\
had struggled, it was unhelpful\
6:24\
and unrealistic for parents and\
leaders assisting him to say\
6:28\
"never again" too quickly or to\
arbitrarily set some standard of\
6:34\
abstinence to be considered\
"worthy." Instead, they started\
6:40\
with small, reachable goals.\
6:43\
They got rid of the all-or-nothing\
expectations\
6:47\
and focused on incremental growth,\
which allowed Damon to\
6:51\
build on a series of successes\
instead of failures.\
6:56\
He, liked the enslaved people of\
Limhi, learned he could "prosper\
7:02\
by degrees." Elder D.\
7:04\
Todd Christofferson has counseled,\
"To deal with\
7:07\
something very big, we may need to\
work at it in small, daily bites.\
7:12\
Incorporating new and wholesome\
habits into our character\
7:16\
or overcoming bad habits or\
addictions most often means\
7:20\
an effort today followed by\
another tomorrow and then\
7:23\
another, perhaps for many days,\
even months and years.\
7:28\
But we can do it because we can\
appeal to God … for the help we\
7:32\
need each day." Now, brothers and\
sisters, the COVID-19\
7:38\
pandemic has not been easy for\
anyone, but the isolation\
7:45\
associated with quarantine\
restrictions has made life\
7:48\
especially difficult for those\
struggling with bad habits.\
7:53\
Remember change is possible,\
repentance is\
7:57\
a process, and worthiness is not\
flawlessness.\
8:02\
Most important, remember that God\
and Christ are willing to help us\
8:06\
right here and now.\
8:08\
Some mistakenly receive the\
message that God is waiting\
8:11\
to help until after we repent.\
8:15\
God's message is that He will help\
us as we repent.\
8:21\
His grace is available to us "no\
matter where we are in the path\
8:25\
of obedience." Elder Dieter F.\
8:27\
Uchtdorf has said, "God does not\
need people who are flawless.\
8:32\
He seeks those who will offer\
their heart and a willing\
8:35\
mind, and He will make them\
perfect in Christ." So many have\
8:41\
been hurt by broken and strained\
relationships that it is\
8:45\
difficult for them to believe in\
God's compassion\
8:48\
and long-suffering.\
8:50\
They struggle to see God as He is-\
a loving Father who meets us\
8:55\
in our need and knows how to "give\
good things to them that\
8:59\
ask him." His grace is not just a\
prize for the worthy.\
9:05\
It is the "divine assistance" He\
gives that helps us become worthy.\
9:10\
It is not just a reward for the\
righteous.\
9:14\
It is the “endowment of strength”\
9:16\
He gives that helps us become\
righteous.\
9:20\
We are not just walking toward God\
and Christ.\
9:24\
We are walking with Them.\
9:28\
Across the church, young people\
recite the Young Women\
9:31\
and Aaronic Priesthood quorum\
themes.\
9:33\
From New Zealand to Spain to\
Ethiopia to Japan, young women\
9:38\
say, "I cherish the gift of\
repentance." From Chile to\
9:43\
Guatemala to Moroni, Utah, young\
men say, "As\
9:47\
I strive to serve, exercise faith,\
repent, and improve each\
9:52\
day, I will qualify to receive\
temple blessings and\
9:56\
the enduring joy of the gospel." I\
promise those blessings\
10:01\
and that joy are real and within\
reach for those who keep all\
10:07\
the commandments and "him that\
seeketh so to do." When you feel\
10:15\
like you have failed too many\
times to keep trying, remember\
10:20\
Christ's Atonement and the grace\
it makes possible are real.\
10:24\
His "arms of mercy [are] extended\
towards you." You are\
10:28\
loved-today, in 20 years, and\
forever.\
10:33\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
