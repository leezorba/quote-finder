Once when I was very young, I\
briefly thought about\
0:06\
running away from home.\
0:09\
In a little-boy way, I felt no one\
loved me.\
0:14\
My observant mother listened and\
assured me I was safely home.\
0:21\
Have you ever felt like you were\
running away from home?\
0:25\
Often running from home means\
trust has been frayed or\
0:28\
broken, trust with ourself, with\
each other, with God.\
0:33\
When trust is challenged, we\
wonder how to trust again.\
0:40\
My message today is whether we are\
coming home or going\
0:45\
home, God is coming to meet us.\
0:49\
In Him We can find faith and\
courage, wisdom\
0:52\
and discernment to trust again.\
0:57\
Likewise, he asked us to keep the\
lid on for each other to be\
1:01\
more forgiving and less judgmental\
of ourselves and each other.\
1:06\
So His Church can be a place where\
we feel at home,\
1:10\
whether we're coming for the first\
time or returning.\
1:15\
Trust is an act of faith.\
1:18\
God keeps faith with us.\
1:20\
Yet human faith can be undermined\
or broken when a friend, business\
1:26\
associate, or someone we trust\
isn't truthful, hurts, or takes\
1:30\
advantage of us.\
1:32\
A marriage partner is unfaithful.\
1:35\
Perhaps unexpectedly, someone we\
love confronts death,\
1:38\
injury, or illness.\
1:41\
We face an unanticipated gospel\
question, perhaps something\
1:46\
regarding Church history or Church\
policy, and someone\
1:49\
says our Church somehow hid or did\
not tell the truth.\
1:54\
Other situations may be less\
specific, but equal concern.\
2:00\
Perhaps we don't see ourselves in\
the Church, don't feel we\
2:04\
fit, feel judged by others, or\
though we have done\
2:09\
everything expected, things have\
yet to work out.\
2:14\
Despite our personal experiences\
with the Holy Ghost, we may not\
2:19\
yet feel we know God lives or the\
gospel's true?\
2:23\
Many today feel a great need to\
restore trust in human\
2:28\
relationships and modern society.\
2:32\
As we reflect on trust, we know\
2:34\
God is a god of truth and cannot\
lie.\
2:37\
We know truth is a knowledge of\
things as they are, were,\
2:40\
and are to come.\
2:42\
We know continuing revelation and\
inspiration fit, unchanging\
2:46\
truth to changing circumstances.\
2:51\
We know broken covenants break\
hearts.\
2:54\
"I did stupid things," he says.\
2:57\
"Can you ever forgive me?" The\
husband and wife may hold hands\
3:01\
hoping to trust again.\
3:04\
In a different setting, a prison\
inmate reflects, "If I had kept\
3:09\
the Word of Wisdom, I would not be\
here today." We know joy\
3:14\
on the Lord's Covenant path and\
callings to serve in His\
3:17\
Church are an invitation to feel\
God's trust and love for us\
3:22\
and each other.\
3:24\
Church members, including young\
single adults, regularly serve\
3:28\
across the Church and in our\
communities.\
3:32\
By inspiration, a bishop recalls a\
young couple who serve in\
3:36\
the ward nursery.\
3:37\
At first, the husband sits in the\
corner, detached\
3:41\
and distant.\
3:43\
Gradually, he begins smiling with\
the children.\
3:47\
Later, the couple expressed\
gratitude.\
3:50\
Earlier, they say the wife wanted\
children.\
3:54\
The husband did not.\
3:56\
Now, serving has changed and\
united them.\
4:01\
It has also brought the joy of\
children into their marriage\
4:05\
and home.\
4:07\
In another city, a young mother\
with little children and her\
4:10\
husband are surprised and\
overwhelmed but accept when\
4:15\
she's called to serve as ward\
Release Society president.\
4:19\
Shortly thereafter, ice storms cut\
electric power, leaving store\
4:23\
shelves empty and homes as cold as\
ice boxes.\
4:28\
Because they have power and heat,\
this young family\
4:32\
generously opens their home to\
several families and individuals\
4:35\
to weather the storm.\
4:38\
Trust becomes real when we do hard\
things with faith.\
4:43\
Service and sacrifice increase\
capacity and refined hearts.\
4:48\
Trusting God in each other brings\
heaven's blessings.\
4:54\
After surviving cancer, a faithful\
brother's hit by\
4:57\
a car.\
4:59\
Instead of feeling sorry for\
himself, he personally\
5:01\
asks, "What can I learn from this\
experience?" In his intensive\
5:07\
care unit, he feels prompted to\
notice a nurse worried for her\
5:10\
husband and children.\
5:12\
A patient in pain finds answers as\
he trusts God and reaches out\
5:19\
to others.\
5:22\
As a brother with pornography\
concerns waits outside his\
5:25\
office, a stake president prays to\
know how to help.\
5:30\
A clear impression comes: "open\
the door and let the brother in.\
5:35\
With faith and trust, God will\
help." The priesthood leader\
5:39\
opens the door and embraces the\
brother.\
5:43\
Each feels the transforming love\
of trust for God and each other.\
5:48\
Fortified, the brother can begin\
to repent and change.\
5:54\
While our individual circumstances\
are\
5:56\
personal, gospel principles and\
the Holy Ghost can help us\
6:01\
know if, how, and when to trust in\
others again.\
6:06\
When trust is broken or betrayed,\
disappointment\
6:09\
and disillusionment are real; so\
is the need\
6:13\
for discernment to know when faith\
and courage are merited to\
6:17\
trust again in human relations.\
6:21\
Yet with respect to God and\
personal revelation,\
6:24\
President Russell M.\
6:25\
Nelson assures, "You do not have\
to wonder whom you\
6:31\
can safely trust."\
6:34\
We can always trust God.\
6:36\
The Lord knows this better and\
loves us more than we know\
6:41\
or love ourselves.\
6:43\
His infinite love and perfect\
knowledge of past,\
6:47\
present, and future make his\
covenants and promises constant\
6:53\
and sure.\
6:55\
Trust what the scriptures call "in\
the process of time." With\
7:00\
God's blessing process of time and\
continuing faith\
7:04\
and obedience, we can find\
resolution and peace.\
7:09\
The Lord comforts: "Weeping may\
endure for a night, but Joy\
7:14\
Cometh in the morning." "Cast your\
burdens upon the Lord\
7:18\
and trust his constant care."\
"Earth has no sorrow that heaven\
7:25\
cannot heal." Trust God in his\
miracles.\
7:30\
We and our relationships can\
change.\
7:32\
Through the Atonement of Christ\
the Lord, we can put off our own\
7:36\
selfish natural self and become a\
child of God, meek,\
7:41\
humble, full of faith and\
appropriate trust.\
7:44\
When we repent, when we confess\
and forsake or sins, the Lord\
7:49\
says He remembers them no more.\
7:52\
It is not that He forgets; rather,\
in a remarkable\
7:55\
way, it seems He chooses not to\
remember them, nor need we.\
8:02\
Trust God's inspiration to discern\
wisely.\
8:05\
We can forgive others in the right\
time and way, as\
8:08\
the Lord says we must, "being wise\
as serpents and harmless\
8:13\
as dogs." Sometimes when our\
hearts are most broken\
8:18\
and contrite, we are most open to\
the comforting guidance of\
8:22\
the Holy Ghost.\
8:23\
Condemnation and forgiveness both\
begin by recognizing the wrong.\
8:28\
Often, condemnation focuses on the\
past.\
8:32\
Forgiveness looks liberatingly to\
the future.\
8:37\
"For God sent not his son into the\
world to condemn the\
8:40\
world; but that the world through\
him might be saved." The Apostle\
8:46\
Paul asks, "Who shall separate us\
from the love of Christ?" He\
8:50\
answers, "Neither death nor life\
nor height nor depth shall be\
8:54\
able to separate us from the love\
of God, which is in\
8:57\
Christ, Jesus, our Lord." Yet\
there is someone who can separate\
9:02\
us from God and Jesus Christ-and\
that someone is us, ourselves."\
9:09\
As Isaiah says, "Your sins have\
hid his face from you." By divine\
9:16\
love and divine law, we are\
responsible for our choices\
9:20\
and their consequences.\
9:22\
But our Savior's atoning love is\
infinite and eternal.When we're\
9:27\
ready to come home, even when we\
are yet a great way off, God is\
9:33\
ready with great compassion to\
welcome us, joyfully offering\
9:38\
the best He has.\
9:40\
President J.\
Reuben, Clark said:\
9:43\
"I believe\
that our Heavenly Father wants to\
9:45\
save every one of His children,\
that in His justice\
9:49\
and mercy, He will give us the\
maximum reward for our\
9:52\
acts, give us all that He can\
give.\
9:55\
And in the reverse, I believe He\
will impose upon us the minimum\
9:59\
penalty, which it is possible for\
Him to impose." On\
10:05\
the cross, even our Savior's\
merciful plea to His Father was\
10:09\
not an unconditional "Father,\
forgive them,"\
10:13\
but rather, "Father, forgive them,\
for they know not what they\
10:17\
do." Our agency and freedom have\
meaning because we're accountable\
10:22\
before God and ourselves for who\
we are, for what we know and do.\
10:29\
Thankfully, we can trust God's\
perfect justice and perfect mercy\
10:36\
to judge perfectly our intents and\
actions.\
10:40\
We conclude as we begin-with God's\
compassion as we each come\
10:45\
home to Him and each other.\
10:47\
Do you remember Jesus Christ's\
parable about a certain man who\
10:51\
had two sons?\
10:53\
One son left home and wasted his\
inheritance.\
10:57\
When he came to himself, this son\
sought to come home, the other\
11:01\
son feeling he had kept the\
commandments "lo, these many\
11:05\
years" did not want to welcome his\
brother home.\
11:10\
Brothers and sisters, would you\
please consider Jesus is asking\
11:15\
us to open our hearts, our\
understanding,\
11:18\
compassion, and humility, and to\
see ourselves in both roles?\
11:25\
Like the first son or daughter, we\
may wander\
11:28\
and later seek to return home.\
11:31\
God waits to welcome us.\
11:33\
And like the other son or\
daughter, we re gently\
11:36\
entreated by God to rejoice\
together\
11:39\
as we each come home to\
Him.\
11:42\
He invites us to make our\
congregations, quorums,\
11:45\
classes, and activities open,\
authentic, safe - home\
11:51\
for each other.\
11:53\
With kindness, understanding, and\
mutual\
11:56\
respect, we each humbly seek the\
Lord and pray and welcome His\
12:01\
restored gospel blessings for all.\
12:05\
Our life journeys are individual,\
but we can come again\
12:08\
to God God our Father and his\
Beloved Son through trusting\
12:13\
God, each other, and ourselves.\
12:18\
Jesus beckons, "Be not afraid,\
only believe." As did\
12:24\
the Prophet Joseph, undaunted, may\
we trust in our\
12:29\
heavenly father's care.\
12:32\
Dear brother, dear sister, dear\
friend, pease look\
12:38\
again for faith and trust-a\
miracle.\
12:43\
He promises you today.\
12:46\
In the sacred and holy name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
