For more than a century, the\
national bicycle racing teams\
0:05\
of Great Britain had been the\
laughingstock\
0:07\
of the cycling\
world.\
0:09\
Mired in mediocrity, British\
riders had managed only\
0:12\
a handful of gold medals in 100\
years of Olympic competitions\
0:16\
and had been even more\
underwhelming and cycling's\
0:19\
marquee event, the three-week-long\
Tour de\
0:21\
France- where no British rider had\
prevailed in 110 years.\
0:27\
So sorry was the plight of British\
riders that some bike\
0:30\
manufacturers refused to even sell\
bikes to the Brits, fearing\
0:35\
it would forever sully their\
hard-won reputations.\
0:38\
And despite devoting enormous\
resources into cutting-edge\
0:41\
technology and every newfangled\
training regimen,\
0:44\
nothing worked\
well.\
0:46\
Nothing that is until 2003, when a\
small, largely\
0:51\
unnoticed change occurred that\
would forever alter\
0:54\
the trajectory of British cycling.\
0:56\
That new approach would also\
reveal any eternal principle with\
1:00\
a promise regarding our ofttimes\
perplexing mortal quest to\
1:05\
improve ourselves.\
1:07\
So what happened in British\
cycling that has great relevance\
1:10\
to our personal pursuit to be\
better daughters and sons of God?\
1:15\
In 2003, Sir Dave Brailsford was\
hired.\
1:19\
Unlike previous coaches who\
attempted dramatic overnight\
1:22\
turnarounds, Sir Brailsford\
instead committed to a strategy\
1:26\
he referred to as "the aggregation\
of marginal gains."\
1:31\
This entailed implementing small\
improvements in everything.\
1:34\
That meant constantly measuring\
key statistics and training\
1:38\
targeting specific weaknesses.\
1:41\
It's somewhat akin to the prophet\
Samuel\
1:43\
the Lamanite's notion of "walking\
circumspectly." Now, this\
1:47\
broader, more holistic view avoids\
the trap of being\
1:51\
myopically fixated on just the\
obvious problem or sin at hand.\
1:56\
Said Brailsford, "The whole\
principle came from the idea that\
1:59\
if you broke down, everything you\
could think of that goes into\
2:02\
riding a bike, and then improve it\
by just 1 percent, Yyu will\
2:07\
get a significant increase when\
you put them all together." Now\
2:12\
his approach aligns well with the\
Lord's, who taught us\
2:15\
the criticalness of the 1 percent-\
even at the expense of\
2:19\
the 99 percent.\
2:21\
Now, of course, He was teaching\
the gospel imperative to seek out\
2:24\
those in need.\
2:26\
But what if we applied that same\
principle to the very sweet\
2:29\
and savory second principle of the\
gospel, repentance?\
2:34\
Rather than being stymied by the\
churn and dramatic swings\
2:38\
between sin and repentance, what\
if our approach\
2:41\
was to narrow our focus-even as we\
broadened it?\
2:45\
Instead of trying to perfect\
everything, what if we tackled\
2:49\
just one thing?\
2:51\
For example, what if in your new\
wide-angle awareness, you\
2:54\
discover you'd neglected a daily\
reading of the Book of Mormon?\
2:58\
Well, instead of desperately\
plowing through all 536 pages in\
3:02\
one night, what if we committed\
instead to read just 1 percent of\
3:07\
it-that's just five pages a day-or\
another manageable goal\
3:11\
for your situation?\
3:13\
Could aggregating small but steady\
marginal gains in our\
3:16\
lives finally be the way to\
victory over even the most pesky\
3:21\
of our personal shortcomings?\
3:23\
Can this bite-sized approach to\
3:25\
tackling our blemishes really\
work?\
3:28\
Well, acclaimed author James Clear\
says this strategy puts\
3:32\
the math squarely in our favor.\
3:34\
He maintains that "habits are 'the\
compound interest of\
3:38\
self-improvement.' If you can get\
just 1 percent better at\
3:42\
something each day by the end of a\
year, you will be 37 times\
3:48\
better." Brailsford's small gains\
begin with the obvious, such\
3:52\
as equipment, kit fabrics, and\
training patterns.\
3:55\
But his team didn't stop there.\
3:57\
They continued to find 1 percent\
improvements in overlooked\
4:01\
and unexpected areas such as\
nutrition\
4:03\
and even maintenance\
nuances.\
4:06\
Over time, these myriad of these\
micro-betterments aggregated into\
4:10\
stunning results, which came\
faster than\
4:11\
anyone could have\
imagined.\
4:14\
Truly, they were onto the eternal\
principle of "line\
4:17\
upon line, precept upon precept,\
here a little,\
4:21\
and there a little." Will little\
adjustments work that mighty\
4:26\
change that you desire?\
4:28\
Properly implemented, I'm 99\
percent certain they will.\
4:32\
But the one caveat with this\
approach is that for small gains\
4:36\
to aggregate, there must be a\
consistent\
4:38\
day-in and day-out\
effort.\
4:40\
And although we likely won't be\
perfect, we must be determined to\
4:44\
mirror our persistence with\
patience.\
4:47\
Do that, and the sweet rewards of\
increased righteousness will\
4:50\
bring you the joy and peace which\
you seek.\
4:54\
As President Nelson has taught:\
"Nothing is more\
4:57\
liberating, more ennobling, or\
more crucial to our\
5:00\
individual progression than is a\
regular daily focus\
5:04\
on repentance.\
5:05\
Repentance is not an event; it is\
a process.\
5:09\
It is the key to happiness and\
peace of mind.\
5:12\
When coupled with faith,\
repentance opens our access to\
5:15\
the power of the Atonement of\
Jesus Christ." Now as to\
5:20\
repentance's prerequisite of\
faith, the scriptures are very\
5:23\
clear all that's initially\
required is a mere "particle of\
5:27\
faith." And if we can mustered\
this "mustard seed"\
5:31\
mentality, we too can expect\
unexpected and exceptional\
5:35\
improvements in our lives.\
5:38\
But remember, just as we would not\
attempt to go from being\
5:41\
Attila the Hun to Mother Teresa\
overnight, so too should we\
5:45\
reorient our patterns of\
improvement incrementally.\
5:49\
Even if the changes needed in your\
life or wholesale, begin at\
5:54\
a small scale.\
5:55\
That's especially true if you're\
feeling overwhelmed\
5:58\
or discouraged.\
5:59\
This process is not always\
accomplished in a linear fashion.\
6:03\
Even among the most determined,\
there may be setbacks.\
6:07\
Now, having experienced the\
frustration of this in my own\
6:10\
life, I can tell you that it can\
sometimes feel like 1 percent\
6:14\
forward and then 2 percent back.\
6:17\
Yet if we remain undaunted in our\
determination to consistently eke\
6:21\
out those 1 percent gains, He who\
has carried our\
6:24\
sorrows will surely carry us.\
6:28\
Now, obviously, if we are involved\
in grievous\
6:30\
sins, the Lord is clear and\
unequivocal.\
6:32\
We need to stop, get help from our\
bishop, and turn away from\
6:35\
such practices immediately.\
6:38\
But as Elder David A.\
6:39\
Bednar enjoined: "Small, steady\
incremental spiritual\
6:43\
improvements are the steps the\
Lord would have us take.\
6:47\
Preparing to walk guiltless before\
God is one of the primary\
6:50\
purposes of mortality and the\
pursuit of a\
6:52\
lifetime; it does not result from\
sporadic spurts of intense\
6:57\
spiritual activity." So does this\
pocket-sized approach to\
7:03\
repentance and real change really\
work?" Is the proof in\
7:07\
the peddling, so to speak?\
7:09\
Well, consider what's happened to\
British cycling in the past two\
7:13\
decades since implementing this\
philosophy.\
7:16\
British cyclists have now won the\
storied Tour de France\
7:19\
an astonishing six times during\
the past four Olympic Games.\
7:23\
Great Britain has been the most\
successful country across all\
7:27\
cycling disciplines.\
7:29\
And in the recently concluded\
Tokyo Olympics, the UK won more\
7:33\
gold medals in cycling than any\
other country.\
7:37\
But far outshining worldly silver\
or gold are precious promise down\
7:41\
our roadway to the eternities is\
that we will indeed\
7:45\
triumph in Christ.\
7:47\
And as we commit to making small\
but steady improvements, we are\
7:50\
promised "a crown of glory that\
fadeth not away." With basking in\
7:56\
that undimmable luster beckoning,\
I invite you to\
7:59\
examine your life and see what\
stagnated or possibly show slowed\
8:03\
you on the covenant pathway.\
8:05\
Then look broader.\
8:06\
Seek modest but makeable fixes in\
your life that might result in\
8:10\
the sweet joy of being just a\
little better.\
8:14\
Remember, David used just one\
small stone to take down\
8:17\
a seemingly invincible giant, but\
he had four other\
8:20\
stones at the ready.\
8:22\
Similarly, Alma, the Younger's\
wicked disposition and eternal\
8:25\
destiny was altered by just one\
simple, salient thought-a\
8:30\
remembrance of his father's\
teachings about the saving grace\
8:33\
of Jesus Christ.\
8:36\
And so it is with our Savior, who,\
though\
8:38\
sinless, "received not of the\
fulness at first,\
8:42\
but continued from grace to grace,\
until he received\
8:46\
a fulness." It is He who knows\
when a sparrow falls that is\
8:50\
likewise focused on the minute as\
well as the momentous moments\
8:54\
in our lives and who is ready\
right now to assist you in\
8:58\
whatever your 1 percent quest is\
coming out of this conference.\
9:03\
Because every effort to change we\
make, no matter how tiny it seems\
9:07\
to us, just might make the biggest\
difference in your life.\
9:11\
To this end, Elder Neal A.\
9:12\
Maxwell taught, "Each assertion of\
a righteous desire, each act\
9:18\
of service, and each act of\
worship, however small\
9:20\
and incremental, adds to our\
spiritual momentum.\
9:24\
Truly, it is by small, simple,\
and, yes, even just 1\
9:27\
percent things that great things\
can be brought to pass.\
9:31\
Ultimate victory is 100 percent\
certain, "after all we can do"\
9:36\
through the might, merits, and\
mercy of our Lord\
9:39\
and Savior, Jesus Christ.\
9:41\
I so testify in the name of Jesus\
Christ, amen.\
