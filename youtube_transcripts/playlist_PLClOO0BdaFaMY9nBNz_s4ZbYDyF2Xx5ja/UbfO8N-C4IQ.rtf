My dear brothers and sisters,\
welcome to general conference!\
0:07\
What a joy it is to be with you.\
0:10\
Youâ€™ve been on my mind almost\
constantly\
0:13\
during the past six\
months.\
0:16\
I have prayed about you and for\
you.\
0:21\
During recent weeks, I have prayed\
intently that this\
0:25\
conference would be a time of\
revelation and reflection\
0:29\
for all who seek those blessings.\
0:33\
We are delighted to be speaking to\
you from the Conference Center\
0:36\
once again.\
0:39\
Most of the seats remain empty,\
but the presence of some\
0:44\
members of the Tabernacle Choir is\
a wonderful step forward.\
0:49\
We welcome you all to this largely\
virtual\
0:52\
conference, wherever you are.\
0:56\
We are still dealing with the\
ravages of COVID-19\
1:00\
and its\
variants.\
1:02\
We thank you for following our\
counsel and the advice of medical\
1:06\
experts and government officials\
in your own communities.\
1:12\
We convene each general conference\
as directed by the Lord.\
1:18\
The format has varied over the\
years.\
1:22\
When I was much younger,\
1:24\
conference lasted three or four\
days.\
1:27\
Later, conference was reduced to\
two days.\
1:31\
Every message, then and now, is\
the result of earnest\
1:37\
prayer and much spiritual\
preparation.\
1:42\
The General Authorities and\
General Officers of\
1:45\
the Church who speak will focus\
their messages on our\
1:48\
Savior, Jesus Christ, His mercy,\
and His infinite redeeming power.\
1:57\
There has never been a time in the\
history of the world when\
2:00\
knowledge of our Savior is more\
personally vital and relevant to\
2:06\
every human soul.\
2:10\
Imagine how quickly the\
devastating conflicts\
2:13\
throughout the world and those in\
our individual lives would be\
2:17\
resolved if we all chose to follow\
Jesus Christ\
2:22\
and heed His\
teachings.\
2:27\
In that spirit, I invite you to\
listen for three things during\
2:31\
this conference: pure truth,\
2:37\
the pure doctrine of Christ,\
2:41\
and pure revelation.\
2:45\
Contrary to the doubts of some,\
there really is such\
2:49\
a thing as right and wrong.\
2:52\
There really is absolute truth,\
eternal truth.\
2:58\
One of the plagues of our day is\
that too few people know where to\
3:02\
turn for truth.\
3:06\
I can assure you that what you\
will hear today or tomorrow\
3:10\
constitutes pure truth.\
3:15\
The pure doctrine of Christ is\
powerful.\
3:19\
It changes the life of everyone\
who understands it.\
3:24\
And seeks to implement it in his\
or her life.\
3:30\
The doctrine of Christ helps us\
find and stay on\
3:35\
the covenant\
path.\
3:37\
Staying on that narrow but\
well-defined path will\
3:40\
ultimately qualify us to receive\
all that God has.\
3:46\
Nothing could be worth more than\
all our Father has.\
3:55\
Finally, pure revelation for the\
questions in your heart will\
4:01\
make this conference rewarding and\
unforgettable.\
4:07\
If you have not yet sought for the\
ministering of the Holy\
4:11\
Ghost to help you hear what the\
Lord would have you hear\
4:15\
during these two days, I invite\
you to do so now.\
4:22\
Please make this conference a time\
of feasting on messages\
4:26\
from the Lord through His\
servants.\
4:29\
Learn how to apply them in your\
life.\
4:33\
This is the Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
4:39\
We are His covenant people.\
4:43\
The Lord declared that He would\
hasten His work in its\
4:45\
time, and He is doing so at an\
ever-increasing pace.\
4:51\
We are privileged to participate\
in His holy work.\
4:59\
I invoke a blessing upon all who\
are seeking greater\
5:02\
light, knowledge, and truth.\
5:05\
I express my love for each of you,\
in the sacred name of Jesus\
5:10\
Christ, amen.\
