My beloved brothers and sisters, I\
am grateful for\
0:06\
the opportunity to speak with you\
in this Saturday evening session\
0:12\
of general conference.\
0:16\
In his introduction to the\
conference this\
0:18\
morning, President Russell M.\
0:21\
Nelson said that, (quote) "Pure\
revelation for the questions in\
0:30\
your heart will make this\
conference rewarding\
0:35\
and unforgettable.\
0:39\
If you have not yet sought for the\
ministering of the Holy\
0:43\
Ghost to help you hear what the\
Lord would have you hear\
0:48\
during these two days, I invite\
you to do so now." (Close quote.)\
0:57\
I have sought for that blessing as\
I prepared to receive this\
1:03\
revelation for this visit with\
you.\
1:08\
My earnest prayer is that you may\
receive revelation from God.\
1:16\
The way to receive revelation from\
God has not changed from\
1:21\
the days of Adam and Eve.\
1:24\
It has been the same for all\
called servants of the Lord from\
1:29\
the beginning to the present day.\
1:33\
It is the same for you and for me.\
1:37\
It is always done by exercising\
faith.\
1:43\
The teenage Joseph Smith had faith\
sufficient to ask\
1:49\
a question of God, believing that\
God\
1:53\
would answer his heartfelt\
need.\
1:57\
The answer that came changed the\
world.\
2:02\
He wanted to know what church to\
join to be cleansed of sin.\
2:08\
The answer he received encouraged\
him to keep asking even better\
2:14\
questions and to act on the\
continuing flow of revelation\
2:20\
that had just begun.\
2:23\
Your experience can possibly be\
similar in this conference.\
2:31\
If you have questions for which\
you seek answers, you have at\
2:36\
least enough faith to hope that\
you will receive answers from\
2:41\
the Lord through His servants.\
2:45\
You will not have the opportunity\
to ask aloud\
2:48\
for answers from the speakers, but\
you can ask your\
2:53\
loving Father in prayer.\
2:57\
I know from experience that\
answers will come to fit your\
3:01\
needs and your spiritual\
preparation.\
3:07\
If you need an answer that is\
important to your eternal welfare\
3:11\
or that of others, the answer is\
more likely to come.\
3:18\
Yet even then, you may receive, as\
did Joseph\
3:20\
Smith, the answers to be patient.\
3:26\
If your faith in Jesus Christ has\
led to a heart softened through\
3:31\
the effects of His Atonement, you\
will be more able\
3:36\
to feel the whisperings of the\
Spirit in answer to your prayers.\
3:44\
My personal experience is that the\
still, small voice, which is\
3:50\
real, is clear and discernible in\
my mind when I feel an internal\
3:58\
quiet and submission to the Lord's\
will.\
4:03\
To me, the clearest answers to my\
questions that have ever come are\
4:09\
when I came to the place of\
saying,\
4:12\
“I only want what you\
want.\
4:15\
Not what I want." That feeling of\
humility can be best described\
4:21\
as "Not my will, but thine, be\
done." The process of\
4:27\
revelation is why you will hear\
speakers teach, as you have in\
4:33\
this conference, what is called\
the doctrine of Christ.\
4:39\
Revelation comes to us in\
proportion to the degree to which\
4:45\
we have sought to take the\
doctrine of Christ into our\
4:49\
hearts and implement it in our\
lives.\
4:55\
You remember from the Book of\
Mormon that Nephi taught us that\
5:00\
faith in Jesus Christ is the key\
to receiving revelations of truth\
5:08\
and the key to having the\
confidence that we are\
5:11\
following the Savior's direction.\
5:15\
Nephi wrote the following words\
centuries before the birth of\
5:20\
Jesus Christ into mortality: (open\
quote) "Angels\
5:27\
speak by the power of the Holy\
Ghost; wherefore, they speak\
5:32\
the words of Christ.\
5:35\
Wherefore, I said unto you, feast\
upon the words of\
5:38\
Christ; for behold, the words of\
Christ will tell you all things\
5:42\
what ye should do.\
5:45\
Wherefore, now after I have spoken\
these words, if ye cannot\
5:49\
understand them it will be because\
you ask not, neither do\
5:54\
ye knock; [therefore] ye are not\
brought into the light, but must\
5:59\
perish in the dark.\
6:02\
For behold, again I say to you\
that if ye will enter in by\
6:05\
the way, and receive the Holy\
Ghost, it will show unto you all\
6:10\
things what ye should do.\
6:14\
Behold, this is the doctrine of\
Christ, and there will be no more\
6:19\
doctrine given until after he\
shall manifest himself unto you\
6:25\
in the flesh.\
6:27\
And when he shall manifest himself\
unto you in the\
6:29\
flesh, the things which he shall\
say unto you shall ye observe to\
6:34\
do." (Close quote.)\
6:37\
The Lord will say things through\
His servants to you and to me\
6:42\
today and in the days ahead.\
6:45\
He will tell us what things we\
should do.\
6:49\
The Savior will not shout commands\
to you and me.\
6:55\
As He taught Elijah, (open quote)\
"And he said, Go forth,\
7:01\
and stand upon the mount before\
the Lord.\
7:04\
And, behold, the Lord passed by,\
and a great and strong wind\
7:09\
rent the mountains, and brake in\
pieces the rocks before\
7:13\
the Lord; but the Lord was not in\
the wind: and after the wind\
7:20\
an earthquake; but the Lord was\
not in the earthquake: and after\
7:26\
the earthquake a fire; but the\
Lord was not in the\
7:30\
fire: and after the fire a still\
small voice." (Close quote.)\
7:39\
Hearing that voice will come from\
our faith in Him.\
7:43\
With sufficient faith, we will ask\
for direction with\
7:48\
the intent to go and do whatever\
He asks.\
7:53\
We will have developed the faith\
to know that whatever He asks\
7:59\
will bless others and that we can\
be purified in the process\
8:05\
because of His love for us.\
8:08\
As our faith in Jesus Christ will\
have led us to ask the Father\
8:13\
for answers, that faith will also\
have brought the Savior's\
8:18\
softening touch enough for us to\
hear the direction and be\
8:24\
determined and excited to obey.\
8:28\
Then we will sing the words of the\
hymn with joy, even when\
8:33\
the work is hard: "Sweet is the\
work, my God, my King."\
8:42\
The more we have the doctrine of\
Christ in our lives and\
8:45\
hearts, the more we feel greater\
love and sympathy for those who\
8:50\
have never had the blessings of\
faith in Jesus Christ or are\
8:55\
struggling to maintain it.\
8:58\
It is hard to keep the Lord's\
commandments without faith\
9:02\
and trust in Him.\
9:04\
As some lose their faith in the\
Savior, they may even attack\
9:08\
His counsel, calling good evil and\
evil good.\
9:15\
To avoid this tragic error, it is\
crucial that any\
9:21\
personal revelation we feel we\
receive be consonant with\
9:27\
the teachings of the Lord and His\
prophets.\
9:32\
Brothers and sisters, it takes\
faith to be obedient to\
9:37\
the Lord's commandments.\
9:39\
It takes faith in Jesus Christ to\
serve others for Him.\
9:45\
It takes faith to go out to teach\
His gospel and offer it to people\
9:51\
who may not feel the voice of the\
Spirit or may even deny\
9:55\
the reality of the message.\
9:58\
But as we exercise our faith in\
Christ and follow His living\
10:05\
prophet, faith will increase\
across the world.\
10:12\
Because of technology, perhaps\
more of God's children will hear\
10:18\
and recognize the word of God this\
weekend than during any\
10:23\
other two days in history.\
10:26\
With increasing faith that this is\
the Lord's Church and kingdom\
10:30\
on earth, more members pay tithing\
and donate to those in\
10:36\
need, even as those members face\
trials of their own.\
10:42\
With faith that they are called by\
Jesus Christ, missionaries\
10:48\
across the world have found ways\
to rise above the challenges\
10:53\
created by a pandemic, doing so\
with courage and good cheer.\
10:59\
And in their extra effort, their\
faith has grown stronger.\
11:06\
Opposition and trials\
11:09\
have long been a seedbed\
for the growth of faith.\
11:15\
That has always been true,\
especially\
11:18\
since the beginning\
of the Restoration\
11:20\
and the founding of the Lord’s\
Church.\
11:24\
What President George Q.\
11:25\
Cannon said long ago is true today\
and will be until\
11:31\
the Savior comes personally to\
lead His Church and His\
11:36\
people: (open quote) "Obedience to\
the gospel brings [people]\
11:42\
into very close and intimate\
relationship with the Lord.\
11:48\
It establishes a close connection\
between men on the earth and our\
11:55\
Great Creator in the heavens.\
11:58\
It brings to the human mind a\
feeling of perfect confidence\
12:03\
in the Almighty and in His\
willingness to listen to\
12:08\
and answer the supplications of\
those who trust in Him.\
12:15\
In times of trial and difficulty\
this confidence is beyond price.\
12:24\
Trouble may come upon the\
individual or upon\
12:28\
the people, disaster may threaten\
and every human hope seem to be\
12:34\
overthrown, yet, where people have\
availed themselves of\
12:39\
the privileges which obedience to\
the gospel brings, they have\
12:44\
a sure standing place; their feet\
are upon a rock that cannot be\
12:51\
moved." (Close quote.) It is my\
testimony that the rock upon\
12:58\
which we stand is our witness that\
Jesus is the Christ, that\
13:05\
this is His Church, which He leads\
personally, and that\
13:11\
President Russell M.\
13:12\
Nelson is His living prophet\
today.\
13:18\
President Nelson seeks and\
receives direction from\
13:22\
the Lord.\
13:25\
He is for me an example of seeking\
that direction with\
13:30\
a determination to follow it.\
13:34\
That same determination to be\
obedient to the Lord's direction\
13:39\
is in the heart of all those who\
have spoken or will\
13:43\
speak, pray, or sing in this\
general conference of His Church.\
13:50\
I pray that those across the earth\
who watch or listen to\
13:55\
this conference will have the\
feeling of the Lord's love\
14:00\
for them.\
14:02\
Heavenly Father has answered my\
prayer that I might feel at least\
14:06\
a tiny part of the Savior's love\
for you and His love for His\
14:15\
Heavenly Father, who is our\
Heavenly Father.\
14:19\
I testify that Jesus Christ lives.\
14:24\
He is our Savior and our Redeemer.\
14:28\
This is His Church.\
14:30\
He is at its head.\
14:33\
He, with His Heavenly Father,\
appeared in person to\
14:37\
Joseph Smith in a grove of trees\
in New York.\
14:41\
The gospel of Jesus Christ and His\
priesthood were restored\
14:45\
through heavenly messengers.\
14:48\
By the power of the Holy Ghost, I\
know that is true.\
14:54\
I pray that you may have that same\
witness.\
14:58\
I pray that you will ask Heavenly\
Father for the faith in Jesus\
15:02\
Christ you need to make and keep\
the covenants that will allow\
15:09\
the Holy Ghost to be your constant\
companion.\
15:13\
I leave you with my love and my\
sure witness in the sacred name\
15:20\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
