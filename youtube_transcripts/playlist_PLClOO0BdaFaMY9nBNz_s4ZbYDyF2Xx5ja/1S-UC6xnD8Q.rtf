One more talk, and we'll get to\
hear our beloved prophet give his\
0:05\
closing remarks.\
0:08\
In a press conference on August\
16, 2018, President Russell M.\
0:13\
Nelson said: "The Lord has\
impressed upon my mind\
0:17\
the importance of the name He has\
revealed for His Church, Even\
0:22\
the Church of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-Day Saints.\
0:26\
We have work before us\
0:28\
to bring ourselves in harmony\
with His will.”\
0:33\
Two days later, on August 18th, I\
was with President Nelson\
0:36\
in Montreal, Canada, following our\
member meeting in\
0:40\
the impressive Palais de Congres.\
0:42\
President Nelson answered\
questions from reporters.\
0:46\
He acknowledged that it was "going\
to be a challenge to\
0:49\
reestablish the name of the Church\
and undo a tradition\
0:53\
of more than a hundred years."\
But, he added, "The name of\
0:57\
the church is not negotiable."\
Seven weeks later, President\
1:03\
Nelson spoke in general\
conference: The Lord impressed\
1:06\
upon my mind the importance of the\
name He decreed for His\
1:10\
Church, even The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
1:16\
It was the Savior Himself who\
said, 'For thus shall my church\
1:20\
be called." Then he repeated, "The\
name of\
1:25\
the Church is not negotiable." A\
good question surfaced: "Why\
1:32\
now, when for many decades we had\
embraced the nickname "Mormon"?\
1:37\
"The Mormon Tabernacle Choir," the\
video spots "I'm\
1:40\
a Mormon," the Primary song "I Am\
a Mormon Boy"?\
1:48\
The doctrine of Christ is\
unchanging and everlasting.\
1:51\
Yet specific and important steps\
of the Savior's work are revealed\
1:56\
at their appropriate time.\
1:59\
This morning, President Nelson\
said, "The Restoration is\
2:03\
a process, not an event." And the\
Lord has said, "All things\
2:09\
must come to pass in their time."\
Now is our time, and we are\
2:15\
reestablishing the revealed name\
of the Church.\
2:20\
The identity and destiny of The\
Church of Jesus Christ of\
2:23\
Latter-day Saints requires that we\
be called by his name.\
2:30\
I was recently in Kirtland, Ohio,\
where\
2:32\
the Prophet Joseph Smith, with\
only a few members of\
2:35\
the Church, prophesied, "This\
Church will fill North and South\
2:41\
America- it will fill the world."\
The Lord described\
2:46\
the work of this dispensation as\
"a marvelous work and\
2:49\
a wonder." He spoke of a covenant\
that would be\
2:54\
fulfilled in the latter days,\
allowing all the earth to\
2:58\
be blessed.\
3:01\
The words of this conference\
3:04\
are being translated live\
into 55 languages.\
3:08\
Eventually, these words will be\
heard and read in 97 languages in\
3:14\
more than 220 countries and\
territories.\
3:18\
When the Savior returns and\
majesty and glory, faithful\
3:23\
members of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints will\
3:27\
be among all nations, all people,\
all races, and all\
3:32\
cultures of the world.\
3:37\
The influence of the restored\
Church of Jesus Christ will not\
3:41\
only be upon those who are members\
of the Church.\
3:45\
Because of the heavenly\
manifestations in our\
3:48\
day, because of the sacred\
scripture restored to the earth\
3:52\
and the powerful gifts of the Holy\
Ghost, we will be\
3:57\
a shining light on the hill.\
3:59\
as the somber shades of disbelief\
in Jesus Christ darken\
4:03\
the world.\
4:05\
Although many may allow the world\
to cloud their faith in\
4:08\
the Redeemer, we will not be moved\
out of our place.\
4:14\
Christians who are not among our\
membership will welcome our role\
4:19\
and are sure witness of Christ.\
4:22\
Even those Christians who have\
viewed us with skepticism will\
4:26\
embrace us as friends.\
4:29\
In these coming days,\
4:31\
we will be called by the\
name of Jesus Christ.\
4:37\
Thank you for your noble efforts\
to advance the true name of\
4:40\
the Church.\
4:42\
In the conference three years ago,\
President Nelson promised us\
4:46\
"that our rigorous attention to\
use the correct name of\
4:50\
the Savior's Church would bring us\
increased faith and access to\
4:56\
greater spiritual power." This\
promise has been realized by\
5:01\
devoted disciples across the\
world.\
5:05\
Brother Lauri Ahola from the\
eastern United States admits\
5:10\
that at times he finds it awkward\
to share the full name of\
5:13\
the Church.\
5:15\
But because of the prophet's\
counsel, he persists.\
5:19\
On one occasion, he was visiting a\
friend at a church\
5:22\
of another faith.\
5:25\
Here are his words: An\
acquaintance asked, "Are you\
5:30\
a Mormon?" "'I am a member of The\
Church of Jesus Christ of\
5:35\
Latter-day Saints, yes,′ I said.\
5:38\
He started asking me several\
questions, each beginning\
5:41\
with: 'Does the Mormon Church\
believe...?' At each\
5:46\
time, I began my answer with the\
phrase, 'In the restored\
5:50\
Church of Jesus Christ, we believe\
...′ When he noticed that\
5:56\
I wasn't accepting the title\
"Mormon," he asked me\
5:59\
point-blank, 'Are you not Mormon?'\
So I asked him if he\
6:05\
knew who Mormon was-he didn't.\
6:08\
I told him that Mormon was a\
prophet, and I was honored to\
6:11\
be associated with him.\
6:13\
'But,' I continued, 'Mormon didn't\
die for my sins.\
6:18\
Mormon did not suffer in\
Gethsemane or die on the cross\
6:22\
for me.\
6:23\
Jesus Christ is my God and my\
Savior, and it is by His name\
6:30\
that I want to be known.′\
6:33\
After a few seconds of silence,\
the acquaintance\
6:36\
exclaimed, 'So you are a\
Christian!'" Remember President\
6:43\
Nelson's words?\
6:45\
I promise you that if we will do\
our best to restore the correct\
6:49\
name of the Lord's Church, He\
whose Church this is\
6:54\
will pour down His power and\
blessings upon the heads of\
6:58\
the Latter-day Saints, the likes\
of which we have never seen."\
7:06\
The Lord always keeps His\
promises.\
7:09\
He opens the way for us as we do\
His work.\
7:14\
For years, we had hoped to\
purchase the internet domain\
7:17\
sites, ChurchofJesusChrist.org and\
ChurchofJesusChrist.com.\
7:23\
Neither was for sale.\
7:26\
About the time of President\
Nelson's announcement, both were\
7:30\
suddenly available.\
7:32\
It was a miracle.\
7:35\
The Lord has magnified our efforts\
in revising names that\
7:38\
have long been attached to the\
Church.\
7:42\
Moving forward in faith, the name\
of the Mormon Tabernacle\
7:46\
Choir was changed to The\
Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square.\
7:51\
The website LDS.org, which\
received more than 21 million\
7:56\
visits each month,\
7:58\
was transitioned to\
ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\
8:02\
The name of LDS Business College\
was changed to Ensign College.\
8:08\
The website Mormon.org\
8:10\
was redirected into\
ChurchofJesusChirst.org.\
8:16\
More than 1,000 products that have\
the name "Mormon" or "LDS"\
8:24\
attached to them have been\
renamed.\
8:27\
Faithful Latter-day Saints have\
adjusted their websites,\
8:31\
podcasts, and Twitter accounts.\
8:35\
We adopted a new symbol centered\
in Jesus Christ.\
8:39\
At the center of the symbol is a\
representation of Thorvaldsen's\
8:45\
marble statue the Chritus.\
8:48\
It portrays the resurrected,\
living Lord reaching\
8:51\
out to embrace all who will come\
unto Him.\
8:56\
Symbolically, Jesus Christ is\
standing under an arch reminding\
9:02\
us of the resurrected Savior\
emerging from the tomb.\
9:07\
The typography of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\
9:12\
has been adapted in more than 50\
languages.\
9:15\
New domain names have been\
acquired across the world.\
9:22\
We appreciate the many good and\
gracious people who have\
9:26\
honored our desire to be called by\
our correct name.\
9:30\
I read an article recently that\
quoted a Catholic cardinal\
9:33\
referring to the "Latter-day\
Saints." As I visited with\
9:37\
a leader of a Christian church a\
month ago in the eastern United\
9:41\
States, he referred to the Church\
in his first reference\
9:45\
with our entire name and followed\
it up more than once\
9:50\
with the Church of Jesus Christ.\
9:54\
We realize that adding six words\
to our name would not be ideal\
9:59\
for the media.\
10:00\
But as President Nelson foretold,\
"Responsible media will\
10:04\
be sympathetic in responding to\
our request." Thank you\
10:11\
for extending to us the same\
consideration, given\
10:15\
cultural, athletic, political, or\
community\
10:18\
organizations by using our\
preferred name.\
10:23\
There will be a few who are hoping\
to detract or diminish\
10:26\
the seriousness of our mission\
will continue to call us\
10:30\
"Mormons" or "the Mormon Church."\
With courtesy, we again ask\
10:36\
the fair-minded of the media to\
honor our desire to be called by\
10:41\
our name of nearly 200 years.\
10:46\
There are thousands and thousands\
of Latter-day\
10:48\
Saints who have courageously\
proclaimed the name of\
10:51\
the Church.\
10:52\
As we do our part, others will\
follow.\
10:55\
I love this story from Tahiti.\
10:59\
Ten-year-old Iriura Jean resolved\
to follow the counsel of\
11:04\
President Nelson.\
11:06\
"In her school class, they discuss\
their weekend,\
11:08\
and Irirura talked about church.\
11:12\
Her teacher, Viator Peafowl, said,\
'Oh, so you are\
11:18\
a Mormon?' Iriura stated boldly,\
'No, I am a member of The\
11:25\
Church of Jesus Christ of\
Latter-day Saints.′ Her teacher\
11:29\
replied, 'Yes, you are a Mormon.'\
Iriura\
11:33\
insisted, 'No teacher, I am a\
member of The Church of Jesus\
11:38\
Christ of Latter-day Saints.′ Miss\
Pifao was amazed at Iriura's\
11:44\
conviction and wondered why she\
was so insistent on using\
11:48\
the long name of her church.\
11:52\
She decided to learn more\
11:56\
about the Church.\
11:58\
Later, as Sister Vitae Pifao was\
baptized, she expressed gratitude\
12:06\
that Iriura heeded the counsel of\
President Nelson." The name of\
12:12\
the Church is not negotiable.\
12:17\
Let us go forward in faith.\
12:19\
When we willingly follow the\
counsel of the Lord,\
12:22\
as revealed through His living\
prophet, especially if it runs\
12:26\
counter to our initial thinking,\
requiring humility\
12:30\
and sacrifice, the Lord blesses us\
with additional spiritual\
12:34\
power and sends His angels to\
support us and stand by us.\
12:40\
We receive the Lord's affirmation\
and His approval.\
12:48\
I am an eyewitness to the power of\
heaven that rests upon our\
12:51\
beloved prophet, President Russell\
M.\
12:53\
Nelson.\
12:55\
His most sincere desire is to\
please the Lord and bless our\
12:59\
Heavenly Father's children.\
13:02\
From sacred, personal experience,\
I testify of\
13:06\
the Lord's love for him.\
13:08\
He is the prophet of God.\
13:13\
I witness that Jesus is the\
Christ, the Son of God.\
13:17\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
