I was recently assigned to\
0:03\
dedicate a portion of historic\
Nauvoo.\
0:07\
As part of the assignment, I was\
able to visit\
0:10\
Liberty Jail in Missouri.\
0:13\
As I viewed the jail, I\
contemplated the events that\
0:17\
make it such a significant part of\
Church history.\
0:21\
The lives of the Saints were\
threatened as a result of\
0:24\
an extermination order issued by\
the governor of Missouri.\
0:29\
In addition, the Prophet Joseph\
and a few choice associates had\
0:34\
been unjustly imprisoned in\
Liberty Jail.\
0:38\
One of the reasons for the violent\
opposition to our\
0:41\
members was most of them were\
opposed to slavery.\
0:46\
This intense persecution of Joseph\
Smith and his followers\
0:51\
constitutes an extreme example of\
the unrighteous exercise of\
0:56\
agency that can impact righteous\
people.\
1:00\
Joseph's time in Liberty Jail\
demonstrates that adversity is\
1:05\
not evidence of the Lord’s\
disfavor\
1:08\
nor a withdrawal of His\
blessings.\
1:12\
I was deeply moved as I read what\
the Prophet Joseph Smith declared\
1:17\
as he was confined in Liberty\
Jail: "O God, where art thou?\
1:23\
And where is the pavilion that\
covereth thy hiding place?"\
1:28\
Joseph inquired how long the\
Lord's people would suffer\
1:32\
these wrongs and unlawful\
oppressions.\
1:36\
As I stood in Liberty Jail, I was\
deeply touched as\
1:40\
I read the Lord's answer: "My son,\
peace be unto thy\
1:46\
soul; thine adversity and thine\
afflictions shall be but a small\
1:51\
moment; and then, if thou endure\
it well, God shall exalt thee\
1:57\
on high." It is clear that\
opposition can refine us for\
2:02\
an eternal celestial destiny.\
2:06\
The Savior's precious words "My\
son, peace be unto thy soul"\
2:11\
resonate with me personally and\
have great significance\
2:15\
for our day.\
2:17\
They remind me of His teachings to\
His disciples during His\
2:21\
mortal ministry.\
2:23\
Prior to Christ's suffering in the\
garden of Gethsemane and\
2:25\
on the cross, He commanded His\
Apostles to "love one\
2:29\
another, as I have loved you" and\
subsequently comforted them\
2:35\
with these words: "Peace I leave\
with you, my peace I give unto\
2:41\
you: not as the world giveth, give\
I unto you.\
2:45\
Let not your heart be troubled,\
neither let it be\
2:49\
afraid." One of the most cherished\
titles of our Lord\
2:52\
and Savior Jesus Christ is Prince\
of Peace.\
2:57\
Ultimately, His kingdom will be\
established, including peace\
3:01\
and love.\
3:03\
We look forward to the millennial\
reign of\
3:06\
the Messiah.\
3:08\
Notwithstanding this vision of the\
millennial reign, we know\
3:12\
that world peace and harmony are\
not prevalent in our day.\
3:17\
In my lifetime, I have never seen\
a greater lack of civility.\
3:22\
We are bombarded with angry,\
contentious language\
3:26\
and provocative, devastating\
actions that destroy peace\
3:30\
and tranquility.\
3:32\
Peace in the world is not promised\
or assured until\
3:35\
the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.\
3:38\
The Savior instructed His Apostles\
that His earthly mission\
3:44\
would not achieve universal peace.\
3:46\
He taught, "Think not that I am\
come to send peace on earth."\
3:53\
Universal peace was not part\
3:55\
of the Savior’s\
initial mortal ministry.\
3:58\
Universal peace does not exist\
today.\
4:02\
However, personal peace can be\
achieved despite the\
4:06\
anger, contention, and division\
that blights and corrupts our\
4:12\
world today.\
4:14\
It has never been more important\
to seek personal peace.\
4:18\
A beautiful and beloved new hymn,\
written for today's youth\
4:23\
by brother Nik Day, titled "Peace\
in Christ" declares, "When\
4:29\
there's no peace on earth, there\
is peace in Christ."\
4:34\
We were blessed to have this hymn\
just before the worldwide\
4:38\
COVID-19 pandemic.\
4:41\
This hymn reflects in a beautiful\
fashion\
4:44\
the aspiration for peace and\
appropriately emphasizes that\
4:49\
peace is anchored in the life and\
mission of Jesus Christ.\
4:55\
President Joseph F.\
4:56\
Smith declared, "There never can\
come to the world that spirit of\
5:01\
peace and love...\
5:02\
until mankind will receive God's\
truth and God's message...\
5:08\
and acknowledge his power and\
authority which is divine."\
5:13\
While we will never retreat from\
efforts to achieve universal\
5:17\
peace, we have been assured that\
we can have personal peace\
5:22\
as Christ teaches.\
5:24\
This principle is set forth in the\
Doctrine and\
5:26\
Covenants: "But learn that he who\
doeth the works of righteousness\
5:31\
shall receive his reward, even\
peace in this world, and eternal\
5:37\
life in the world to come." What\
are some of the works of\
5:41\
righteousness that will help us\
deal with disputations\
5:45\
and lessen contention and find\
peace in this world?\
5:50\
All of Christ's teachings point in\
this direction.\
5:54\
I will mention a few which I\
believe are\
5:56\
particularly important.\
5:59\
First, love God, live His\
commandments and forgive everyone.\
6:04\
President George Albert Smith\
6:06\
became President of the Church in\
1945.\
6:09\
He had been known during his years\
as an Apostle as\
6:13\
a peace-loving leader.\
6:16\
In the preceding 15 years before\
he became President,\
6:20\
the challenges and trials of a\
massive worldwide depression\
6:24\
followed by the death and\
destruction of World War II\
6:27\
had been anything but peaceful.\
6:30\
At the conclusion of World War II,\
during his first general\
6:34\
conference as President in October\
1945, President Smith\
6:40\
reminded the Saints of the\
Savior's invitation to love\
6:43\
their neighbors and forgive their\
enemies and then taught,\
6:48\
"That is\
the spirit...\
6:49\
all Latter-day Saints should seek\
to possess if they hope some day\
6:54\
to stand in his presence and\
receive at his hands\
6:59\
a glorious welcome home." Second,\
seek the fruits of\
7:04\
the Spirit.\
7:06\
The Apostle Paul, in his epistle\
to the Galatians, sets forth\
7:11\
the dichotomy between works of\
righteousness that qualify us to\
7:16\
inherit the kingdom of God and\
works that can, without\
7:20\
repentance, disqualify us.\
7:22\
Among those that qualify us are\
the fruits of the Spirit:\
7:27\
"love, joy, peace, longsuffering,\
7:30\
gentleness, goodness, faith,\
meekness, [and]\
7:34\
temperance." Paul also includes\
bearing one another's burdens\
7:40\
and "[being] not weary in well\
doing." Among those works that\
7:44\
are not righteous, he includes\
hatred, wrath, and strife.\
7:51\
One of the great lessons in the\
Old Testament period relates\
7:55\
to Father Abraham.\
7:57\
Abraham and Lot, his nephew, were\
wealthy but found\
8:00\
they could not dwell together.\
8:03\
To eliminate strife, Abraham\
allowed Lot\
8:05\
to choose the land he\
wanted.\
8:07\
Lott chose the plain of Jordan,\
which was both well\
8:10\
watered and beautiful.\
8:12\
Abraham took the less fertile\
plain of Mamre.\
8:15\
The scriptures read that Abraham\
then pitched his tent and built\
8:20\
an altar unto the Lord.\
8:23\
Lot, on the other hand, pitched\
his tent toward Sodom.\
8:28\
The lesson is clear: we should be\
willing to compromise\
8:31\
and eliminate strife with respect\
to matters that do not involve\
8:35\
righteousness to have peaceful\
relationships.\
8:39\
As King Benjamin taught, "Ye will\
not have a mind to injure one\
8:43\
another, but to live peaceably."\
But on conduct relating to\
8:47\
righteousness and doctrinal\
imperatives, we need to remain\
8:51\
firm and steadfast.\
8:53\
If we want to have the peace which\
is the reward of the works\
8:57\
of righteousness, we will not\
pitch our tents towards\
9:02\
the world.\
9:03\
We will pitch our tents towards\
the temple.\
9:08\
Third, exercise agency to choose\
righteousness.\
9:12\
Peace and agency are intertwined\
as essential elements of\
9:15\
the plan of salvation.\
9:17\
As described in the Gospel Topic\
on agency and\
9:21\
accountability, "Agency is the\
ability and privilege God\
9:25\
gives us to choose and to act for\
ourselves." Thus agency is at\
9:31\
the heart of the personal growth\
and experience that blesses us\
9:36\
as we follow the Savior.\
9:39\
Agency was a principal issue in\
the premortal council in heaven\
9:43\
and the conflict between those who\
chose to follow Christ\
9:47\
and the followers of Satan.\
9:49\
Lletting go of pride and control\
and choosing the Savior would\
9:55\
allow us to have His light and His\
peace.\
9:59\
But personal peace would be\
challenged when people exercise\
10:03\
their agency in harmful and\
hurtful ways.\
10:07\
I am confident that the peaceful\
assurance we felt in our hearts\
10:12\
was strengthened by the knowledge\
we had of what\
10:15\
the Savior of the world would\
accomplish in our behalf.\
10:19\
This is beautifully set forth in\
"Preach My Gospel":\
10:22\
quote, "As we rely on the\
Atonement of Jesus\
10:26\
Christ, He can help us endure our\
trials, sicknesses, and pain.\
10:32\
We can be filled with joy, peace,\
and consolation.\
10:38\
All that is unfair about life can\
be made right through\
10:42\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ."\
End quote.\
10:46\
Fourth, build Zion in our hearts\
and homes.\
10:49\
We are children of God and part of\
His family.\
10:53\
We are also part of the family\
into which we are born.\
10:56\
The institution of the family is\
the foundation for both happiness\
11:00\
and peace.\
11:02\
President Russell M.\
11:03\
Nelson has taught us, and during\
this pandemic we have\
11:07\
learned, that the home-centered,\
Church-supported\
11:10\
religious observance can unleash\
the power of families to\
11:15\
transform our homes into a\
sanctuary of faith.\
11:20\
If we have this religious\
observance in our homes, we will\
11:24\
also have the Savior's peace.\
11:27\
We are aware that many of you do\
not have the blessings of\
11:30\
righteous homes and contend\
regularly\
11:33\
with those who choose\
unrighteousness.\
11:37\
The Savior can provide protection\
and peace to guide you ultimately\
11:42\
to safety and shelter from life's\
storms.\
11:47\
I assure you that the joy, love,\
and fulfillment\
11:49\
experienced in loving, righteous\
families produces both peace\
11:53\
and happiness.\
11:55\
Love and kindness are at the\
center of having Zion in our\
11:58\
hearts and homes.\
12:00\
Fifth, follow the current\
admonitions of our prophet.\
12:05\
Our peace is greatly enhanced when\
we follow the Lord's\
12:08\
prophet, President Russell M.\
12:09\
Nelson.\
12:11\
We will shortly have an\
opportunity to hear from him.\
12:14\
He was prepared from the\
foundations of the world\
12:17\
for this calling.\
12:19\
His personal preparation has been\
most remarkable.\
12:23\
He has taught us that "we can feel\
enduring peace and\
12:27\
joy, even during turbulent times"\
as we strive to become more like\
12:32\
our Savior, Jesus Christ.\
12:35\
He's counseled us to repent daily\
to receive the Lord's\
12:38\
cleansing, healing, and\
strengthening power.\
12:42\
I'm a personal witness that\
revelation has been received\
12:45\
and continues to be received from\
heaven by our beloved prophet.\
12:50\
While we honor and sustain him as\
our prophet, we worship our\
12:55\
Heavenly Father and our Savior\
Jesus Christ.\
12:59\
We are ministered to by the Holy\
Ghost.\
13:02\
I testify and provide my personal\
apostolic witness that Jesus\
13:08\
Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of\
the world, leads and guides\
13:13\
His restored Church.\
13:15\
His life and atoning mission are\
the true source of peace.\
13:22\
He is the Prince of Peace.\
13:25\
I bear my sure and solemn witness\
that He lives, in the name of\
13:30\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
