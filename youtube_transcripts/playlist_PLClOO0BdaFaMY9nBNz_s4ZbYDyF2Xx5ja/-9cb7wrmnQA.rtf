I recently received a letter from\
an inquisitive young woman.\
0:05\
She wrote, "I'm stuck.\
0:07\
I'm not sure who I am, but I feel\
I am here for something\
0:12\
grand." Have you ever had that\
searching feeling, wondering if\
0:16\
Heavenly Father knows who you are\
and if He needs you?\
0:21\
My dear youth, and to all, I\
testify the answer is\
0:27\
"yes." The Lord has a plan for\
you.\
0:30\
He has prepared you for this day\
right now to be a strength and\
0:35\
a force for good in His mighty\
work.\
0:39\
We need you.\
0:40\
It simply will not be as grand\
without you\
0:43\
Under sacred\
circumstances,\
0:46\
our beloved Prophet, President\
Russell M.\
0:49\
Nelson, once reminded me of two\
simple truths that are\
0:53\
foundational to our grand and\
glorious work.\
0:57\
Sitting on the couch with my\
husband, our Prophet pulled his\
1:01\
chair over, almost knee-to-knee\
with us, and looked at me with\
1:05\
his piercing blue eyes.\
1:08\
I wasn't sure if my heart was\
racing, or had completely stopped\
1:13\
as he called me to service the\
Young Women General President.\
1:17\
He asked a question that still\
echoes in my heart.\
1:21\
"Bonnie, what's the most important\
thing the youth need to\
1:25\
know?" I pondered for a moment and\
said, "they need to know who\
1:30\
they are." "Yes!" he exclaimed.\
1:34\
"And they need to know their\
purpose." You are a\
1:39\
cherished, beloved child of\
Heavenly Father.\
1:42\
He loves you so perfectly that He\
sent His Son, Jesus\
1:46\
Christ, to Atone for you, and for\
me.\
1:50\
The Savior's love for us is\
unfailing, even when we fail.\
1:55\
Nothing can separate us from the\
love of God.\
1:59\
Remembering this love can help you\
push back the confusion of\
2:03\
the world that tries to weaken\
your confidence in your divine\
2:07\
identity and blind you of your\
potential.\
2:12\
At an FSY conference, I met two\
young women\
2:14\
who had been\
struggling.\
2:16\
Both young women mentioned turning\
to her patriarchal\
2:19\
blessing to rediscover the Lord's\
love and guidance\
2:23\
for her personally.\
2:25\
Find your patriarchal blessing,\
blow off the\
2:28\
dust, if you must, but study it\
often.\
2:32\
If you don't have one, get one\
soon.\
2:35\
Don't delay finding what the Lord\
wants to tell you now\
2:39\
about who you are.\
2:42\
President Nelson's second truth\
spoken to us that day is to know\
2:46\
our purpose.\
2:48\
This is a grand and noble charge.\
2:51\
Many years ago, my son Tanner was\
about five years old when he\
2:55\
played his first soccer game.\
2:57\
He was thrilled.\
2:59\
When we arrived at the game, we\
realized his team was\
3:02\
using a regulation-sized soccer\
goal.\
3:05\
Not some little pop-up goal, but a\
very large net that\
3:09\
seemed way too big for\
five-year-olds.\
3:12\
The game took on mythic\
proportions as I saw Tanner take\
3:16\
the goalie position.\
3:18\
I was so surprised.\
3:20\
Did he really understand his\
purpose in guarding the net?\
3:24\
The whistle blew and we became so\
caught up in the game we\
3:27\
forgot all about Tanner.\
3:29\
Suddenly, one of the opposing team\
members got the ball\
3:33\
and dribbled swiftly towards him.\
3:35\
I looked in Tanner's direction to\
make certain he was ready to\
3:38\
stand his ground and defend the\
goal.\
3:42\
I saw something I was not\
expecting.\
3:45\
At some point in the game, Tanner\
had become\
3:48\
distracted and began weaving his\
left arm through the various\
3:52\
holes in the net.\
3:54\
Then he did the same with his\
right arm.\
3:56\
Next, his left foot, and finally\
his right foot.\
4:01\
Tanner was fully entangled in the\
net.\
4:04\
He had forgotten his purpose and\
what he had been entrusted to do.\
4:10\
While Tanner's soccer career\
didn't last long, his lesson to\
4:14\
me that day will never fade.\
4:17\
We occasionally get distracted\
from why we are here and divert\
4:21\
our energies somewhere else.\
4:25\
One of Satan's most powerful\
weapons is to distract us with\
4:30\
good and better causes, which, in\
times of need, may\
4:34\
blind and bind us away from the\
best cause, the very work\
4:40\
that called us into this world.\
4:42\
Our eternal purpose is to come\
unto Christ, and to actively join\
4:47\
Him in His Great Work.\
4:49\
It's as simple as President Nelson\
taught: "Any time we do\
4:53\
anything that helps anyone make\
and keep their covenant with\
4:58\
God, we are helping to gather\
Israel." When we do His\
5:03\
work, together with Him, We come\
to know and love Him more.\
5:10\
We continually seek to draw closer\
to the Savior through\
5:14\
faith, cherished repentance, and\
keeping\
5:17\
the commandments.\
5:19\
As we find ourselves to Him\
through covenants\
5:22\
and ordinances, our lives are\
filled with confidence,\
5:26\
protection, and deep and lasting\
joy.\
5:32\
As we come to Him, we see others\
through His eyes.\
5:36\
Coming to Christ.\
5:38\
Come now, but don't come alone.\
5:43\
The gospel of Jesus Christ is not\
just nice.\
5:47\
It is essential for all.\
5:51\
There is no other way or means\
whereby we can be saved; only in\
5:57\
and through Christ.\
5:59\
The world needs Jesus Christ.\
6:02\
We need Jesus Christ.\
6:05\
Remember, the best way for you to\
improve the world is to prepare\
6:10\
the world for Christ by inviting\
all to follow Him.\
6:16\
There is this story in the Book of\
Mormon that speaks powerfully\
6:20\
of the resurrected Savior spending\
time with the Nephites.\
6:25\
Can you imagine what that would\
have been like?\
6:28\
As Christ announced that He must\
return to the Father, he cast his\
6:33\
eyes round about again.\
6:36\
Seeing tears in the people's eyes,\
He knew their hearts were\
6:40\
longing for Him to linger.\
6:42\
He asked, "Have you any sick among\
you?\
6:47\
Bring them hither.\
6:49\
Have you any lame or blind, deaf\
or that are afflicted\
6:54\
in any manner?\
6:56\
Bring them hither and I will heal\
them." Having great\
7:00\
compassion, He set no limits, and\
He called for\
7:05\
all, that are afflicted in any\
manner.\
7:09\
I love that nothing is too big\
7:12\
or too small for\
Jesus Christ to heal.\
7:16\
He knows our suffering as well,\
and He calls, Bring forth\
7:20\
the anxious and depressed, the\
weary,\
7:23\
the prideful and misunderstood,\
the\
7:26\
lonely, or those who are afflicted\
in any manner.\
7:31\
"And all did go forth, and He did\
heal them every one, both they\
7:39\
who had been healed and they were\
whole bowed down at His\
7:43\
feet, and did worship Him." Every\
time I read this, I ask\
7:48\
myself, "who will I bring to\
Christ?" Who will you bring?\
7:54\
Can we look around again, as Jesus\
did, to make sure no one\
7:59\
is missed, and everyone is invited\
to come to know Him?\
8:04\
Let me share an example of how\
simple it can be.\
8:09\
My 15-year-old friend Payton had a\
goal to read five verses of\
8:14\
scripture at breakfast each day.\
8:17\
But she didn't do it alone.\
8:19\
Looking again, Payton invited her\
parents and siblings, even her\
8:23\
five-year-old brother.\
8:24\
This seemingly small act is what\
Christ was teaching when He\
8:28\
invited, "Bring them hither." This\
invitation from the Lord is\
8:33\
still extended today.\
8:35\
Young women and young men, start\
now, in your own home.\
8:42\
Will you pray, and ask Heavenly\
Father how you can support your\
8:47\
parents as they continue to come\
unto Christ?\
8:50\
They need you just as much as you\
need them.\
8:54\
Then look again at your siblings,\
your friends\
8:56\
and neighbors.\
8:57\
Who will you bring to Christ?\
8:59\
Our Savior declared, "Behold, I am\
the light." I have\
9:05\
set an example for you.\
9:07\
We will feel the love and peace of\
the Savior as we join Him in\
9:10\
saving God's family.\
9:12\
For He has promised, "he that\
followeth me shall not walk in\
9:16\
darkness, but shall have light of\
life." What a glorious time to be\
9:24\
engaged in the cause of Christ.\
9:27\
Yes, you are here for something\
grand.\
9:31\
I join with President Nelson, who\
said, "the Lord needs\
9:34\
you to change the world.\
9:36\
As you accept and follow His will\
for you, you will find yourself\
9:40\
accomplishing the impossible." I\
boldly testify that the Lord\
9:44\
knows you and He loves you.\
9:46\
Together, we will advance His\
purpose until the great day when\
9:50\
Christ Himself returns to the\
Earth and shall call each of\
9:54\
us to "come hither." We will\
joyfully gather together for we\
9:58\
are those who come unto Christ,\
and we do not come alone.\
10:02\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
