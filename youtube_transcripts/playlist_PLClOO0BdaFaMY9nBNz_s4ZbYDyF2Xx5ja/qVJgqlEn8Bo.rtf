I pray that the Holy Ghost will\
enlighten and edify all of us\
0:06\
as we consider together the\
marvelous work of salvation\
0:09\
and exaltation in the dispensation\
of the fullness\
0:13\
of times.\
0:16\
Approximately three years after\
the First Vision on the night of\
0:20\
September 21, 1823, young Joseph\
Smith was praying to receive\
0:26\
a remission of his sins and to\
know of his state and standing\
0:31\
before God.\
0:33\
A personage appeared at his\
bedside, called Joseph by\
0:37\
name, and declared he was a\
messenger sent from\
0:40\
the presence of God and that his\
name was Moroni.\
0:45\
He explained that God had a work\
for Joseph to do and then\
0:49\
instructed him about the coming\
forth of the Book of Mormon.\
0:53\
Significantly, the Book of Mormon\
was one of the first topics\
0:58\
addressed in Moroni's message.\
1:02\
The Book of Mormon is another\
testament of Jesus Christ\
1:06\
and the great tool of conversion\
in the latter days.\
1:10\
Our purpose in sharing the gospel\
is to invite all to\
1:13\
come unto Jesus Christ, receive\
the blessings of the restored\
1:17\
gospel, and endure to the end\
through faith in the Savior.\
1:23\
Helping individuals to experience\
the mighty change of heart\
1:27\
and bind themselves to the Lord\
through sacred covenants\
1:30\
and ordinances are the fundamental\
objectives of\
1:34\
preaching the gospel.\
1:37\
Moroni's introduction of the Book\
of Mormon to Joseph\
1:39\
Smith initiated the work of\
salvation and exaltation\
1:44\
for individuals on this side of\
the veil in the dispensation of\
1:49\
the fullness of times.\
1:51\
Continuing his instruction to\
Joseph, Moroni next quoted from\
1:55\
the Book of Malachi in the Old\
Testament with a little variation\
2:00\
in the language used in the King\
James Version:\
2:04\
"Behold, I will reveal unto you\
the Priesthood, by the hand of\
2:09\
Elijah the prophet, before the\
coming of the great\
2:12\
and dreadful day of the Lord.\
2:15\
And he shall plant in the hearts\
of the children the promises made\
2:19\
to the fathers, and the hearts of\
the children\
2:22\
shall turn to their\
fathers.\
2:25\
If it were not so, the whole earth\
would be utterly wasted at\
2:30\
his coming."\
2:33\
Our purpose in building temples is\
to make available the holy\
2:37\
places wherein the sacred\
covenants and ordinances\
2:41\
necessary for the salvation and\
exaltation of the human\
2:45\
family can be administered for\
both the living and\
2:50\
the dead.\
2:52\
Moroni's instruction to Joseph\
Smith about the vital role of\
2:56\
Elijah and priesthood authority\
expanded the work of salvation\
3:02\
and exaltation on this side of the\
veil and initiated in our\
3:07\
dispensation the work for the dead\
on the other side of\
3:12\
the veil.\
3:14\
In summary, Moroni's teachings in\
September of 1823 about the Book\
3:20\
of Mormon and the mission of\
Elijah established the doctrinal\
3:25\
foundation for the work of\
salvation and exaltation on both\
3:31\
sides of the veil.\
3:34\
The lessons Joseph Smith learned\
from Moroni influenced every\
3:38\
aspect of his ministry.\
3:41\
For example, at a solemn assembly\
held in the Kirtland Temple\
3:45\
on April 6, 1837, the prophet\
taught, quote, "After all that\
3:52\
has been said, the greatest and\
most important duty is to\
3:56\
preach the gospel," close quote.\
4:00\
Almost precisely seven years\
later, on April 7, 1844, Joseph\
4:07\
Smith delivered a sermon known\
today\
4:09\
as the King Follet\
Discourse.\
4:12\
He declared in that address,\
quote, "The greatest\
4:15\
responsibility in this world that\
God has laid upon us is to seek\
4:20\
after our dead," close quote.\
4:25\
But how can preaching the gospel\
and seeking after our dead both\
4:30\
be the single greatest duty and\
responsibility God has placed\
4:34\
upon us?\
4:37\
I believe the Prophet Joseph Smith\
was emphasizing in both\
4:41\
statements the fundamental truth\
that covenants entered into\
4:47\
through authoritative priesthood\
ordinances can bind us to\
4:51\
the Lord Jesus Christ and are the\
essential core of the work of\
4:56\
salvation and exaltation on both\
sides of the veil.\
5:03\
Missionary and temple and family\
history work are complementary\
5:06\
and interrelated aspects of one\
great work that focuses upon\
5:12\
the sacred covenants and\
ordinances that enable us to\
5:16\
receive the power of godliness in\
our lives and ultimately return\
5:22\
to the presence of Heavenly\
Father.\
5:25\
Thus, the two statements by the\
Prophet that initially may\
5:28\
appear contradictory in fact\
highlight the focal point of this\
5:34\
great latter-day work.\
5:38\
The Savior said, "Take my yoke\
upon you, and learn of\
5:42\
me; for I am meek and lowly in\
heart: and ye shall find rest\
5:48\
until your souls.\
5:50\
For my yoke is easy and my burden\
is light." Beloved brothers\
5:56\
and sisters, we take the Savior's\
yoke upon us as we\
6:00\
learn about, worthily receive, and\
honor sacred\
6:06\
covenants and ordinances.\
6:09\
We are bound securely to and with\
the Savior as we\
6:12\
faithfully remember and do our\
best to live in accordance with\
6:16\
the obligations we have accepted.\
6:20\
And that bond with Him is the\
source of spiritual strength\
6:25\
in every season of our lives.\
6:31\
I invite you to consider the\
blessings promised to\
6:33\
covenant- keeping disciples of\
Jesus Christ.\
6:37\
For example, Nephi beheld the\
Church of the Lamb of God in\
6:40\
the latter days, and its numbers\
were few.\
6:45\
The saints of God were also upon\
all the face of the earth\
6:48\
and their dominions were small.\
6:52\
He also beheld the power of the\
Lamb of God, that it\
6:56\
descended upon the saints of the\
Church of the Lamb and upon\
7:01\
the covenant people of the Lord.\
7:04\
And they were armed with\
righteousness and with the power\
7:08\
of God in great glory.\
7:12\
The phrase "armed with\
righteousness and with the power\
7:16\
of God in great glory" is not\
simply a nice idea or an example\
7:22\
of beautiful scriptural language.\
7:24\
Rather, these blessings are\
readily evident in the lives of\
7:28\
countless latter-day disciples of\
the Lord.\
7:33\
My assignments as a member of the\
Twelve take me all over\
7:36\
the world and I have been blessed\
to meet and learn memorable\
7:41\
lessons from many of you.\
7:44\
I testify that the covenant people\
of the Lord today indeed\
7:49\
are armed with righteousness and\
with the power of God in\
7:52\
great glory.\
7:54\
I have witnessed faith, courage,\
perspective,\
7:59\
persistence, and joy that extend\
far beyond mortal capacity\
8:05\
and that only God could provide.\
8:10\
I witnessed the righteousness and\
power of God in great glory\
8:15\
received through faithfulness to\
covenants and ordinances in\
8:19\
the life of a young Church member\
who was partially paralyzed in\
8:24\
a horrific automobile accident.\
8:27\
After grueling months of recovery\
and adapting to a new lifestyle\
8:32\
with restricted mobility,\
8:34\
I met and talked with\
this stalwart soul.\
8:38\
During our conversation, I asked,\
"What has this\
8:41\
experience helped you to learn?"\
The immediate response\
8:46\
was, "I am not sad, I am not mad,\
and everything will be OK."\
8:57\
I witnessed the righteousness and\
power of God in great glory\
9:01\
received through faithfulness to\
covenants and ordinances in\
9:05\
the lives of newly baptized and\
confirmed members of\
9:08\
the church.\
9:10\
These converts were eager to learn\
and serve, willing\
9:14\
but often unsure about how to set\
aside old habits and strong\
9:19\
traditions, and yet joyful to\
become fellow citizens with\
9:24\
the saints and of the household of\
God.\
9:29\
I witnessed the righteousness and\
power of God in great glory\
9:34\
received through faithfulness to\
covenants and ordinances in\
9:38\
the lives of a family who cared\
tenderly for a spouse and parent\
9:43\
with a terminal disease.\
9:46\
These valiant disciples describe\
times that their family felt all\
9:50\
alone and times they knew the hand\
of the Lord was lifting\
9:55\
and strengthening them.\
9:57\
The family expressed sincere\
gratitude for the difficult\
10:01\
mortal experiences that allow us\
to grow and become more like our\
10:05\
Heavenly Father and our Redeemer,\
Jesus Christ.\
10:11\
God succored and blessed this\
family with the companionship of\
10:16\
the Holy Ghost and made their home\
as sacred a place of refuge\
10:21\
as the holy temple.\
10:25\
I witnessed the righteousness and\
power of God in great glory\
10:29\
received through faithfulness to\
covenants and ordinances in\
10:34\
the life of a Church member who\
experienced\
10:36\
the heartache of divorce.\
10:39\
This sister's spiritual and\
emotional distress was\
10:43\
heightened by a sense of\
unfairness associated with her\
10:48\
spouse's violation of covenants\
and the breakup of their marriage.\
10:53\
She wanted justice and\
accountability.\
10:58\
As this faithful woman was\
struggling with all that had\
11:01\
happened to her, she studied and\
pondered the Savior's\
11:05\
Atonement more intently and\
intensely than ever before in\
11:10\
her life.\
11:11\
Gradually, a deeper understanding\
of Christ's redemptive mission\
11:16\
distilled upon her soul, His\
suffering for our sins and also\
11:22\
for our pains, weakness,\
disappointments, and anguish.\
11:29\
And she was inspired to ask\
herself a\
11:32\
penetrating question:\
11:35\
"Since the price already has been\
paid for those sins, would you\
11:40\
demand that the price be paid\
twice?" She realized that such\
11:46\
a requirement would be neither\
just nor merciful.\
11:51\
This woman learned that binding\
herself to the Savior through\
11:54\
covenants and ordinances can heal\
the wounds caused by another\
11:59\
person's unrighteous exercise of\
moral agency and enabled her to\
12:05\
find the capacity to forgive and\
receive peace, mercy,\
12:11\
and love.\
12:15\
Covenant promises and blessings\
are possible only because of our\
12:19\
Savior, Jesus Christ.\
12:22\
He invites us to look to Him, come\
onto Him, learn of\
12:27\
Him, and bind ourselves to Him\
through the covenants\
12:31\
and ordinances of His restored\
gospel.\
12:36\
I testify and promise that\
honoring covenants arms us with\
12:40\
righteousness and with the power\
of God in great glory, and\
12:46\
I witness that the living Lord\
Jesus Christ is our Savior.\
12:52\
Of these truths, I joyfully\
testify in the sacred name of\
12:57\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
