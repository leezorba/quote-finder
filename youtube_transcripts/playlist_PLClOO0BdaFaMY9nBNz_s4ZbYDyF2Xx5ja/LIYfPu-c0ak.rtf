For the past six years, my\
sweetheart and I have lived in\
0:04\
Texas near the Gulf Coast, where\
some of the largest\
0:08\
hurricanes have struck the United\
States, leaving behind\
0:11\
tremendous destruction and even\
loss of life.\
0:15\
Sadly enough, recent months have\
been no stranger to such\
0:18\
devastating events.\
0:20\
Our love and prayers extend to all\
who have been impacted in any way.\
0:26\
In 2017, we personally experienced\
Hurricane\
0:30\
Harvey, which dropped record\
rainfall of up to 60 inches.\
0:35\
Natural laws govern the formation\
of hurricanes.\
0:39\
The ocean temperature must be at\
least 80 degrees\
0:41\
Fahrenheit, extending to 165 feet\
below the ocean's surface.\
0:48\
As wind meets the warm ocean\
water, it causes the water to\
0:52\
vaporize and rise into the\
atmosphere where it liquefies.\
0:56\
Clouds then form and winds produce\
a spiral pattern over\
1:01\
the ocean surface.\
1:04\
Hurricanes are colossal in size,\
reaching 50,000 feet\
1:08\
or more into the atmosphere\
1:11\
and spanning at least \
125 miles across.\
1:14\
Interestingly, as hurricanes meet\
land, they begin to weaken\
1:20\
because they are no longer above\
the warm waters required to fuel\
1:24\
their strength.\
1:26\
You may never face a devastating\
physical hurricane.\
1:30\
However, each of us has weathered\
and will weather spiritual\
1:34\
hurricanes that threaten our peace\
and try our faith.\
1:39\
In today's world, they seem to be\
increasing in frequency\
1:43\
and intensity.\
1:45\
Thankfully, the Lord has provided\
us a sure way to joyfully\
1:50\
overcome them.\
1:52\
By living the gospel of Jesus\
Christ, we are assured that "when\
1:57\
dark clouds of trouble hang o'er\
us and threaten our peace to\
2:01\
destroy, there is hope smiling\
brightly before us.\
2:07\
President Russell M.\
2:08\
Nelson explained: Saints can be\
happy under every circumstance.\
2:13\
We can feel joy even while having\
a bad day, a bad week, or even\
2:19\
a bad year.\
2:21\
The joy we feel has little to do\
with the circumstances of our\
2:25\
lives and everything to do with\
the focus of our lives.\
2:30\
When the focus of our lives is on\
Jesus Christ and his\
2:33\
gospel, we can feel joy regardless\
of what is happening\
2:38\
or not happening in our lives."\
Just as natural laws govern\
2:44\
physical hurricanes, divine laws\
govern how to feel joy during our\
2:49\
spiritual hurricanes.\
2:51\
The joy or misery we feel as we\
braved the storms of life is tied\
2:56\
to the laws that God has set.\
2:58\
President Nelson has shared,\
"They're called\
3:01\
commandments, but they are just as\
true as the law of\
3:04\
lift, the law of gravity, and the\
law that governs\
3:08\
the heartbeat." President Nelson\
continues: "It becomes a rather\
3:14\
simple formula.\
3:15\
If you want to be happy, keep the\
commandments." Doubt is\
3:21\
an enemy of faith and joy, just as\
warm ocean water is\
3:25\
the breeding ground for\
hurricanes.\
3:28\
Doubt is the breeding ground for\
spiritual hurricanes, just\
3:32\
as belief is a choice.\
3:34\
So is doubt when we choose to\
doubt, we choose to be acted\
3:39\
upon, yielding power to the\
adversary, thereby leaving us\
3:43\
weak and vulnerable.\
3:46\
Satan seeks to lead us to the\
breeding ground of doubt.\
3:50\
He seeks to harden our hearts so\
that we will not believe.\
3:55\
The breeding ground of doubt can\
appear inviting because its\
3:59\
seemingly peaceful, warm waters do\
not require us to "live by\
4:04\
every word that proceeded forth\
from the mouth of God." In such\
4:09\
waters Satan tempts us to relax\
our spiritual vigilance.\
4:14\
That inattention can induce a lack\
of spiritual conviction.\
4:19\
where we are "neither cold nor\
hot." If we are not anchored\
4:24\
on Christ, doubt and its allures\
will lead us away to\
4:28\
apathy, where we shall find\
neither miracles, lasting\
4:32\
happiness, nor "rest onto our\
souls." Just as hurricanes weaken\
4:38\
over land, doubt is replaced with\
faith as we build our foundation\
4:44\
on Christ.\
4:45\
We are then able to see spiritual\
hurricanes in their proper\
4:49\
perspective, and our capacity to\
overcome them is enlarged.\
4:54\
Then, "when the devil shall send\
forth his mighty winds,\
4:58\
yes, his shafts in the whirlwind,\
it shall have no\
5:01\
power to drag us down to the gulf\
of misery and endless\
5:05\
wo, because of the rock upon which\
we are built, which is\
5:10\
a sure foundation." President\
Nelson has taught: "Faith in\
5:15\
Jesus Christ is the foundation of\
all belief and the conduit of\
5:20\
divine power.\
5:22\
The Lord does not require perfect\
faith for us to have access to\
5:26\
His perfect power.\
5:28\
But he does ask us to believe."\
Since April general\
5:33\
conference, my family and I have\
been seeking to strengthen our\
5:36\
faith in Jesus Christ and His\
Atonement to help us turn our\
5:41\
challenges into unparalleled\
growth and opportunity.\
5:46\
Our granddaughter Ruby has been\
blessed with a strong,\
5:49\
take-charge will.\
5:51\
When she was born, her esophagus\
was not attached to her stomach.\
5:56\
Even as an infant, Ruby, with her\
parents' help, met this trial\
6:01\
with unusual determination.\
6:04\
Ruby is now five years old.\
6:07\
Though she is still very young,\
she is a powerful example\
6:11\
of not letting her circumstances\
determine her happiness.\
6:16\
She is always happy.\
6:19\
Last May, Ruby faced an additional\
hurricane in her\
6:22\
life with faith.\
6:25\
She was also born with a less than\
fully developed hand that\
6:28\
needed reconstructive surgery.\
6:32\
Prior to this rather complex\
operation, we visited with her\
6:37\
and we gave her a drawing that\
beautifully depicts a child's\
6:40\
hand, warmly holding the hand of\
the Savior.\
6:45\
When we asked her if she was\
nervous, she replied,\
6:48\
"No, I am happy." Then we asked\
her, "Ruby, how is that so?" Ruby\
6:56\
confidently asserted, "Because I\
know that Jesus will hold my\
7:01\
hand." Ruby's recovery has been\
miraculous, and she continues to\
7:07\
be happy.\
7:08\
How the purity of a child's faith\
contrasts with the foolishness of\
7:13\
doubt that can frequently tempt us\
as we get older.\
7:18\
But we can all become as little\
children and choose to put aside\
7:22\
our unbelief.\
7:24\
It is a simple choice.\
7:26\
A caring father diligently pled\
with the Savior, saying, "If thou\
7:31\
canst do any thing, help us."\
Jesus then said unto him: "If\
7:36\
thou canst believe, all things are\
possible to him that believeth.\
7:42\
And straightway the father cried\
out, and said with tears,\
7:45\
Lord, I believe; help thou mine\
unbelief." This humble father\
7:51\
wisely chose to trust his belief\
in Christ rather than his doubt.\
7:57\
President Nelson shared, "Only\
your unbelief will keep God from\
8:02\
blessing you with miracles to move\
the mountains in your life."\
8:08\
How merciful is our God to place\
the bar for us at the level of\
8:11\
believing and not at the level of\
knowing!\
8:15\
Alma teaches: "Blessed is he that\
believeth in the word of God.\
8:20\
For God is merciful and to all who\
believe on his name;\
8:24\
therefore, he desires, in the\
first place, that you should\
8:27\
believe." Yes, in the first place,\
God desires that we\
8:32\
believe in Him.\
8:34\
We face our spiritual hurricanes\
best by believing in Christ\
8:39\
and keeping His commandments.\
8:42\
Our belief and obedience link us\
to power beyond our own to\
8:46\
overcome whatever is happening or\
not happening in our lives.\
8:51\
Yes, God "doth immediately bless\
us" for believing and obeying.\
8:57\
In fact, over time, our state of\
being changes to\
9:01\
happiness, and "we are made alive\
in Christ" as we exercise our\
9:06\
faith in Him and keep His\
commandments.\
9:10\
Brothers and sisters, may we\
choose today to "doubt\
9:14\
not, but be believing." The right\
way is to believe in Christ.\
9:21\
We are "graven on the palms of His\
hands." He is our Savior\
9:26\
and Redeemer, who stands at our\
very door and knocks.In the name\
9:31\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
