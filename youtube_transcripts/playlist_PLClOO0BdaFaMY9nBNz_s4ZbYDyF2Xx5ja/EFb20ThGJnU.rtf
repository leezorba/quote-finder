One of the most striking\
principals taught by the Savior\
0:05\
during His earthly ministry was\
treating others with compassion.\
0:13\
Let us reflect on this principle\
and its practical application by\
0:17\
considering the account of Jesus's\
visit to the home of\
0:21\
Simon the Pharisee.\
0:24\
The gospel of Luke relates that a\
certain woman, considered\
0:28\
a sinner, entered Simon's home\
while Jesus was there.\
0:33\
In humble contrition, the woman\
approached Jesus, washed his feet\
0:39\
with her tears, wiped them with\
her hair, and then kissed\
0:45\
and anointed them with a special\
ointment.\
0:48\
The proud host, who considered\
himself morally superior to\
0:52\
the woman, thought to himself with\
reproach and\
0:56\
arrogance, "This man, if He were a\
prophet, would have known who\
1:03\
and what manner of woman this is\
that toucheth Him, for she is\
1:08\
a sinner." The Pharisee's\
"holier-than-thou" attitude led\
1:14\
him to judge unjustly both Jesus\
and the woman.\
1:19\
But in His omniscience, the Savior\
knew Simon's\
1:22\
mind, and in great wisdom,\
challenged Simon's\
1:26\
condescending attitude, as well as\
admonished him for his lack of\
1:32\
courtesy in receiving a special\
guest like the Savior\
1:36\
into his home.\
1:38\
In fact, Jesus's direct rebuke of\
the Pharisee served as a witness\
1:44\
that Jesus indeed possessed the\
gift of prophecy, and that\
1:49\
this woman, with a humble and\
contrite heart, was repentant\
1:53\
and forgiven for her sins.\
1:57\
As do many other events during\
Jesus's Earthly Ministry, this\
2:01\
account demonstrates once more\
that the Savior acted\
2:05\
compassionately toward all who\
would come unto Him without\
2:10\
distinction, and most especially\
2:13\
toward those who\
most needed His help.\
2:17\
The contrition and reverent love\
shown to Jesus by the woman were\
2:22\
evidence of her sincere repentance\
and desire to receive\
2:26\
a remission of her sins.\
2:29\
However, Simon's superiority\
complex, coupled with his\
2:35\
hardened heart, prevented him from\
showing empathy for that\
2:39\
repentant soul.\
2:41\
And he referred, even to the\
Savior of the world, with\
2:45\
indifference and contempt.\
2:48\
His attitude revealed that his way\
of life was nothing more than\
2:54\
a strict and hollow observance of\
rules and outward manifestations\
2:59\
of his convictions through\
self-aggrandizement\
3:02\
and false holiness.\
3:06\
The compassionate and personalized\
Ministering of\
3:09\
Jesus in this account demonstrates\
a perfect model of\
3:13\
how we should interact with our\
neighbor.\
3:17\
The scriptures have countless\
examples of how the\
3:20\
Savior, moved by His deep and\
abiding compassion,\
3:24\
interacted with people of His day\
and helped those who were\
3:29\
suffering and those who had\
fainted and were scattered abroad\
3:35\
as sheep having no shepherd.\
3:38\
He extended His merciful hand to\
those who needed relief from\
3:42\
their burdens, both physically and\
spiritually.\
3:48\
The compassionate attitude of\
Jesus is rooted in\
3:51\
charity, namely in His pure and\
pure love and perfect\
3:56\
love, which is the essence of His\
Atoning Sacrifice.\
4:02\
Compassion is a fundamental\
characteristic of those who\
4:06\
strive for sanctification, and\
this divine\
4:10\
quality intertwines with other\
Christian traits, such\
4:14\
as mourning with those who mourn,\
and having\
4:18\
empathy, mercy, and kindness.\
4:21\
The expression of compassion for\
others is, in fact,\
4:27\
the essence of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ and the marked\
4:32\
evidence of our spiritual and\
emotional closeness to\
4:37\
the Savior.\
4:39\
Furthermore, it shows the level of\
influence He has on our way of\
4:45\
life and demonstrates the\
magnitude of our spirits.\
4:50\
It is meaningful to observe that\
Jesus's compassionate acts were\
4:55\
not occasional or mandated\
manifestations based on a list of\
4:59\
tasks to be completed, but\
everyday expressions of\
5:04\
the reality of His pure love for\
God and His children and His\
5:08\
abiding desire to help them.\
5:13\
Jesus was able to identify\
people's needs, even at\
5:17\
a distance.\
5:18\
Thus, it's not surprising, for\
example, that\
5:22\
immediately after healing a\
certain centurion's\
5:25\
servant, Jesus traveled from\
Capernaum to the city called Nain.\
5:31\
It was there that Jesus performed\
5:36\
one of the most tender miracles of\
His earthly ministry, when He\
5:42\
commanded a dead young man, the\
only son of a widowed\
5:47\
mother, to rise and live.\
5:50\
Jesus sensed, not only the intense\
suffering of that\
5:55\
poor mother, but the difficult\
circumstances of her life.\
6:00\
And He was moved by genuine\
compassion for her.\
6:04\
Just like the sinful woman and the\
widow of Nain, many\
6:09\
people within our circle of\
influence are seeking\
6:11\
comfort, attention, inclusion, and\
any help that we\
6:16\
can offer them.\
6:18\
We all can be instruments in the\
Lord's hands and act\
6:22\
compassionately toward those in\
need, just as Jesus did.\
6:29\
I know a little girl who was born\
6:35\
with very serious cleft lips and\
cleft palate.\
6:40\
She had to have the first of a\
series of many surgeries\
6:46\
on the second day of her life.\
6:49\
Moved by a genuine compassion for\
those who experience this\
6:53\
same challenge, this girl and her\
parents seek to give\
6:58\
support, understanding, and\
emotional assistance to\
7:02\
others who face this difficult\
reality.\
7:07\
They wrote to me recently and\
shared, "Through our\
7:11\
daughter's challenge, we had the\
opportunity to meet wonderful\
7:15\
people who needed comfort,\
support,\
7:18\
and encouragement.\
7:20\
Sometime ago, our daughter, who is\
11 years old\
7:23\
now, talked with the parents of a\
baby with the same challenge.\
7:29\
During this conversation, our\
daughter momentarily took off\
7:33\
the mask she was wearing due to\
the pandemic, so the parents\
7:38\
could see that there is hope, even\
though their baby\
7:41\
still has a long way to go in the\
next few years to fix\
7:45\
the problem.\
7:47\
We feel very grateful for the\
opportunity to extend our\
7:50\
empathy to those who suffer as the\
Savior does for us.\
7:55\
We feel we ease our pain every\
time we relieve someone else's\
8:01\
pain." My dear friends, as we\
intentionally strive to\
8:07\
incorporate a compassionate\
attitude into our way of\
8:10\
life, as exemplified by the\
Savior, we will become more\
8:15\
sensitive to people's needs.\
8:17\
With that increased sensitivity,\
feelings of genuine\
8:21\
interest and love will permeate\
our every action.\
8:26\
The Lord will recognize our\
efforts and we'll surely be\
8:30\
blessed with opportunities to be\
instruments in His hands, in\
8:35\
softening hearts and in bringing\
relief\
8:38\
to those whose hands hang\
down.\
8:44\
Jesus's admonition to Simon the\
Pharisee also made it clear\
8:50\
that we should never make harsh\
and cruel judgment of our\
8:56\
neighbor because we are all in\
need of understanding and mercy\
9:00\
for our imperfections from our\
loving Heavenly Father.\
9:05\
Wasn't this exactly what the\
Savior taught on another\
9:08\
occasion when He said, "And why\
beholdest thou the mote that is\
9:14\
in thy brother's eye, but\
considereth not the beam that\
9:19\
is in thine own eye?" We need to\
consider that it is not easy to\
9:24\
understand all the circumstances\
that contribute to someone's\
9:29\
attitude or reaction.\
9:31\
Appearances can be deceptive and\
oftentimes do not represent\
9:37\
an accurate measurement of\
someone's behavior.\
9:41\
Unlike you and me, Christ is\
capable of clearly seeing all\
9:47\
facets of a given situation.\
9:50\
Even knowing our weaknesses as He\
does, the Savior does not\
9:55\
rationally condemn us, but\
continues to work with us\
9:59\
compassionately over time, helping\
us to remove\
10:03\
the beam from our eye.\
10:06\
Jesus always looks on the heart\
and not on the appearance.\
10:12\
He himself declared, "Judge not\
according to the appearance."\
10:19\
Now, consider the Savior's wise\
counsel to the Twelve Nephite\
10:23\
disciples regarding this question.\
10:26\
"And know ye that ye shall be\
judges of this people, according\
10:30\
to the judgment which I shall give\
unto you, which shall be just.\
10:36\
Therefore, what manner of men\
ought ye to be?\
10:40\
Verily I say unto you, even as I\
am." "Therefore I would that ye\
10:48\
should be perfect even as I, or\
your Father who is in\
10:53\
heaven is perfect." In this\
context, the Lord, fixes judgment\
10:59\
upon those who take it upon\
themselves to judge the supposed\
11:04\
shortcomings of others\
unrighteously.\
11:07\
In order to qualify ourselves to\
make righteous judgments, we must\
11:12\
strive to become like the Savior\
and look at the imperfections of\
11:16\
individuals compassionately, even\
through His eyes.\
11:21\
Considering we still have a long\
way to go to reach\
11:24\
perfection, perhaps it would be\
better if we sit at Jesus's feet\
11:31\
and plead for mercy for our own\
imperfections, as did\
11:36\
the repentant woman in the\
Pharisee's house, and not\
11:40\
spend so much time and energy\
fixating on the perceived\
11:44\
imperfections of others.\
11:47\
My dear friends, I testify that as\
we strive to incorporate to\
11:51\
Savior's compassionate example\
into our lives, our capacity to\
11:56\
compliment the virtues of our\
neighbors will increase, and our\
12:00\
natural instinct to judge their\
imperfections will decrease.\
12:05\
Our communion with God will grow,\
and certainly our lives\
12:10\
will become sweeter, our feelings\
more tender, and we will find\
12:14\
a never-ending source of\
happiness.\
12:17\
We will be known as peacemakers,\
whose words are\
12:21\
as gentle as the dew of a spring\
morning.\
12:26\
I pray that will become more\
long-suffering and understanding\
12:30\
of others, and that the Lord's\
mercy will, in perfect\
12:33\
meekness, soothe our impatience\
with their imperfections.\
12:38\
This is the Savior's invitation to\
us.\
12:41\
I testify that He lives.\
12:43\
He is the perfect model of\
merciful and patient discipleship.\
12:50\
I bear my testimony of this truth\
in the holy name of the Savior\
12:54\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
