Many years ago, Elder Mark E.\
0:03\
Peterson, a member of the Quorum\
of the Twelve Apostles, began\
0:08\
a talk with this hypothetical\
example.\
0:11\
Quote, "Kenneth and his wife,\
Lucille, are good\
0:15\
people, honest and upright.\
0:19\
They don't go to church, though,\
and they feel they can be\
0:22\
good enough without it.\
0:25\
They teach their children honesty\
and virtue, and they tell\
0:30\
themselves that is about all the\
Church would do for them.\
0:35\
And anyway, they insist that they\
need their weekends for family\
0:40\
recreation, and Church-going would\
really get in their way."\
0:46\
End of quote.\
0:49\
Today, my message concerns such\
good and religious minded-people\
0:55\
who have stopped attending or\
participating in their churches.\
1:02\
When I say churches, I include\
synagogues, mosques, or other\
1:07\
religious organizations.\
1:10\
We are concerned that attendance\
in all of these is down\
1:14\
significantly nationwide.\
1:18\
If we cease valuing our churches\
for any reason, we threaten our\
1:24\
personal spiritual life, and\
significant numbers\
1:29\
separating themselves from God\
1:32\
reduces His blessings to our\
nations.\
1:37\
Attendance and activity in a\
Church help us become better\
1:40\
people and better influences on\
the lives of others.\
1:47\
In church, we are taught how to\
apply religious principles.\
1:52\
We learn from one another.\
1:55\
A persuasive example is more\
powerful than a sermon.\
2:01\
We are strengthened by associating\
with others of like minds.\
2:06\
In church attendance and\
participation, our hearts\
2:10\
are, as the Bible says, "knit\
together in love."\
2:17\
The scriptures God has given\
Christians, in the Bible and in\
2:22\
modern revelation, clearly teach\
the need for a church.\
2:27\
Both show that Jesus Christ\
organized the Church\
2:32\
and contemplated that the Church\
would carry on His work after Him.\
2:37\
He called Twelve Apostles, and\
gave them authority\
2:40\
and keys to direct it.\
2:44\
The Bible teaches that Christ is\
the head of the Church, and that\
2:50\
its officers were given "for the\
perfecting of the\
2:54\
Saints, for the work of the\
ministry, for the edifying of\
2:59\
the body of Christ." Surely the\
Bible is clear on the origin\
3:05\
of the Church and the need for it\
now.\
3:11\
Some say that attending church\
meetings is not helping them.\
3:15\
Some say, "I didn't learn anything\
today," or "no one was\
3:20\
friendly to me," or "I was\
offended." Personal\
3:26\
disappointment should never keep\
us from the doctrine of\
3:29\
Christ, who taught us to serve,\
not to be served.\
3:36\
With this in mind, another member\
described\
3:39\
the focus of his church\
attendance.\
3:42\
Quote: "Years ago, I changed my\
attitude about going to church.\
3:49\
No longer do I go to church for my\
sake, but to think of others.\
3:56\
I make a point of saying hello to\
people who sit alone, to welcome\
4:01\
visitors, to volunteer for an\
assignment.\
4:06\
In short, I go to church each week\
with the intent of being\
4:11\
active, not passive, and making a\
positive difference in people's\
4:17\
lives." End of quote.\
4:21\
President Spencer W.\
4:22\
Kimball taught that, quote, "We do\
not go to Sabbath\
4:26\
meetings to be entertained or even\
simply to be instructed.\
4:31\
We go to worship the Lord.\
4:35\
It is an individual\
responsibility.\
4:39\
If the service is a failure to\
you, you have failed.\
4:44\
No one can worship for you.\
4:46\
You must do your own waiting upon\
Lord." End of quote.\
4:53\
Church attendance can open our\
hearts and sanctify our souls.\
5:00\
In a church, we don't just serve\
alone or at our own choice\
5:05\
or convenience.\
5:07\
We usually serve in a team.\
5:10\
In service, we find heaven-sent\
opportunities to rise above\
5:15\
the individualism of our age.\
5:19\
Church-directed service helps us\
overcome the personal selfishness\
5:24\
that can retard our spiritual\
growth.\
5:30\
There are other important\
advantages to mention,\
5:32\
even briefly.\
5:34\
In church, we associate with\
wonderful people striving to\
5:38\
serve God.\
5:40\
This reminds us that we are not\
alone in our religious activities.\
5:46\
We all need associations with\
others, and church associations\
5:51\
are some of the best we can\
experience, for us, and our\
5:55\
companions and children.\
5:58\
Without those associations,\
especially between\
6:01\
children and faithful parents,\
research shows\
6:06\
increasing difficulty for parents\
to raise children in\
6:11\
their faith.\
6:15\
So far, I've spoken about churches\
generally.\
6:20\
Now I address the special reasons\
for membership attendance\
6:24\
and participation in the Savior's\
restored Church of\
6:29\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
6:33\
We, of course, affirm that the\
scriptures, ancient\
6:36\
and modern, clearly teach the\
origin and need for a church\
6:41\
directed by and with the authority\
of our Lord Jesus Christ.\
6:47\
We also testify that the restored\
Church of Jesus\
6:51\
Christ has been established to\
teach the fulness of His\
6:55\
doctrine, and to officiate, with\
His priesthood\
6:59\
authority, to perform the\
ordinances necessary to enter\
7:04\
the kingdom of God.\
7:06\
Members who forgo church\
attendance and rely only\
7:11\
on individual spirituality\
separate themselves from these\
7:17\
gospel essentials: the power and\
blessings of the\
7:21\
priesthood, the fulness of\
restored doctrine, and\
7:27\
the motivations and opportunities\
to apply that doctrine.\
7:33\
They forfeit their opportunity to\
qualified to perpetuate their\
7:38\
family for eternity.\
7:43\
Another great advantage of the\
Restored Church is that it\
7:46\
helps us grow spiritually.\
7:50\
Growth means change.\
7:52\
In spiritual terms, this means\
repenting and seeking to draw\
7:58\
nearer to the Lord.\
8:00\
In the Restored Church, we have\
doctrine, procedures,\
8:04\
and inspired helpers that assist\
us to repent.\
8:10\
Their purpose, even in membership\
councils, is not punishment like\
8:17\
the outcome of a criminal court.\
8:20\
Church membership councils\
lovingly seek to help us qualify\
8:25\
for the mercy of forgiveness made\
possible through the Atonement of\
8:30\
Jesus Christ.\
8:33\
Individual spirituality can seldom\
provide the motivation\
8:38\
and structure for unselfish\
service\
8:42\
provided by the Restored\
Church.\
8:45\
Great examples of this are the\
young men and women\
8:49\
and seniors who put aside their\
schooling or retirement\
8:53\
activities to accept missionary\
callings.\
8:58\
They work as missionaries to\
strangers in unfamiliar places\
9:03\
they have not chosen.\
9:06\
The same is true of faithful\
members who participate in\
9:10\
the unselfish service we call\
temple work.\
9:14\
None of such service would be\
possible without the Church that\
9:18\
sponsors it, organizes it, and\
directs it.\
9:24\
Our members' religious faith and\
Church service have taught\
9:28\
them how to work in cooperative\
efforts\
9:31\
to benefit the larger\
community.\
9:34\
That kind of experience and\
development does not happen\
9:38\
in the individualism so prevalent\
in the practices of\
9:43\
our current society.\
9:46\
In the geographic organization of\
our local wards, we associate\
9:51\
and work with persons we might not\
otherwise have chosen.\
9:56\
Persons who teach us and test us.\
9:59\
In addition to helping us learn\
spiritual qualities like\
10:03\
love, compassion, forgiveness, and\
10:06\
patience, this gives us the\
opportunities to learn how to\
10:11\
work with persons of very\
different backgrounds\
10:15\
and preferences.\
10:18\
This advantage has helped members-\
many of our\
10:21\
members, and many organizations\
are blessed\
10:25\
by their\
participation.\
10:28\
Latter-day Saints are renowned for\
their ability to lead\
10:32\
and unite in cooperative efforts.\
10:35\
That tradition originated with our\
courageous pioneers, who\
10:39\
colonized the Intermountain West\
and established our valued\
10:44\
tradition of unselfish cooperation\
for the common good.\
10:51\
Most humanitarian and charitable\
efforts need to be accomplished\
10:55\
by pooling and managing individual\
resources on a large scale.\
11:02\
The Restored Church does this with\
its enormous humanitarian\
11:06\
efforts worldwide.\
11:08\
These include educational and\
medical supplies, feeding\
11:13\
the hungry, caring for refugees,\
helping to reverse\
11:18\
the effects of addictions, and a\
host of others.\
11:22\
Our Church members are renowned\
for their Helping Hands projects\
11:28\
in natural disasters.\
11:31\
Church membership allows us to be\
part of such large scale efforts.\
11:38\
Members also pay fast offerings to\
help the poor in their own midst.\
11:45\
In addition to feeling peace and\
joy through\
11:49\
the companionship of the Spirit,\
our Church-attending\
11:53\
members enjoy the fruits of gospel\
living, such as\
11:58\
the blessings of living the word\
of wisdom, and the material\
12:03\
and spiritual prosperity promised\
for living the law of tithing.\
12:09\
We also have the blessing of\
counsel from inspired leaders.\
12:16\
Crowning all of this are the\
authoritative priesthood\
12:19\
ordinances necessary for eternity,\
including\
12:24\
the sacrament we receive each\
Sabbath day.\
12:29\
The culminating ordinance in the\
Restored Church is\
12:33\
the everlasting covenant of\
marriage, which makes possible\
12:38\
the perpetuation of glorious\
family relationships.\
12:44\
President Nelson taught this\
principle in a memorable\
12:48\
way: he said, "we cannot wish our\
way into the presence of God." We\
12:55\
are to obey the laws upon which\
that blessing is predicated.\
13:04\
One of those laws is to worship in\
Church each Sabbath day.\
13:09\
Our worship and application of\
eternal principles draw us closer\
13:14\
to God and magnify our capacity to\
love.\
13:20\
Parley P. Pratt, one of \
the original Apostles of this\
13:24\
dispensation, described how he\
felt when the Prophet Joseph\
13:29\
Smith explained these principles.\
13:32\
Quote, "I felt that God was my\
Heavenly Father indeed.\
13:39\
That Jesus was my brother and that\
the wife of my bosom was\
13:44\
an immortal, eternal companion, a\
kind, ministering\
13:50\
angel given to me as a comfort and\
a crown of glory, forever\
13:55\
and ever.\
13:57\
In short, I could now love with\
the Spirit and with understanding\
14:04\
also." End of quote.\
14:08\
In closing, I remind all that we\
do not believe that good can only\
14:14\
be accomplished through a Church.\
14:18\
Independent of the Church, we see\
millions of people\
14:21\
supporting and carrying out\
innumerable good works.\
14:26\
Individually, Latter-day Saints\
participate in many of them.\
14:32\
We see these works as a\
manifestation of the eternal\
14:36\
truth that, quote, "the Spirit\
giveth light to every man that\
14:42\
cometh into the world." End of\
quote.\
14:48\
Despite the good works that can be\
accomplished without\
14:51\
a church, the fulness of doctrine\
and its saving and exalting\
14:56\
ordinances are available only in\
the Restored Church.\
15:02\
In addition, Church attendance\
gives us strength\
15:06\
and enhancement of faith that\
comes from associating with other\
15:11\
believers and worshipping together\
with those who are also\
15:16\
striving to stay on the covenant\
path\
15:19\
and be better disciples of\
Christ.\
15:23\
I pray that we will all be\
steadfast in these church\
15:26\
experiences as we seek eternal\
life, the greatest of all\
15:32\
the gifts of God.\
15:34\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
