Before I begin, I should tell you that\
two of my children have passed out\
0:06\
whilst speaking at pulpits,\
0:07\
and I've never felt more connected\
to them than in this moment.\
0:14\
I've got more on my mind than\
just the trap door.\
0:18\
Our family has six children who\
sometimes tease one another that\
0:23\
they're the favorite child. Each has\
different reasons for being preferred.\
0:28\
Our love for each of our children is\
pure and fulfilling and complete.\
0:34\
We could not love any one of\
them any more than another.\
0:38\
With each child's birth came the most\
beautiful expansion of our love.\
0:44\
I most relate to my Heavenly Father's\
love for me through the love that\
0:48\
I feel for my children. As they each\
rehearse their claims to be\
0:53\
the most loved child, you might have\
thought that our family had never had\
0:56\
an untidy bedroom. The\
sense of blemishes in\
1:00\
the relationship between parent and\
child is diminished with a focus\
1:04\
on love. At some point, perhaps because\
1:08\
I can see that we're heading towards\
an inevitable family riot,\
1:11\
I’ll say something like, “Okay,\
you’ve worn me down,\
1:14\
but I’m not going to announce it, you\
know which one of you is my favorite.”\
1:18\
My goal is that each one of\
the six feels victorious\
1:22\
and all-out war is avoided,\
at least until next time.”\
1:28\
In his gospel, John describes himself\
as “the disciple whom Jesus loved,”\
1:34\
as if that arrangement\
was somehow unique.\
1:37\
I like to think that this\
was because John felt\
1:40\
so completely loved by Jesus.\
1:43\
Nephi gave me a similar sense when\
he wrote, “I glory in my Jesus.”\
1:49\
Of course, the Savior isn’t Nephi’s\
any more than He is John’s,\
1:53\
and yet the personal nature of Nephi’s\
relationship with “his” Jesus led him\
1:58\
to that tender description.\
2:01\
Isn't it wonderful that there are\
times when we can feel so fully\
2:04\
and personally noticed and loved?\
2:07\
Nephi can call Him “his”\
Jesus and so can we.\
2:12\
Our Savior’s love is the “highest,\
noblest, strongest kind of love,”\
2:17\
and He provides until we are “filled.”\
2:20\
Divine love never runs dry, and we\
are each a cherished favorite.\
2:26\
God’s love is where, as circles on\
a Venn diagram, we all overlap.\
2:32\
Whichever parts of\
us seem different,\
2:35\
His love is where we find togetherness.\
2:38\
Is it any surprise that the greatest\
commandments are to love God\
2:42\
and to love those around us?\
2:44\
When I see people showing Christlike\
love for one another,\
2:47\
it feels to me as if that love contains\
more than just their love;\
2:51\
it’s a love that also\
has divinity in it.\
2:55\
When we love one another in this way,\
as completely and fully as we can,\
2:59\
Heaven gets involved too.\
3:02\
So if someone we care about seems\
distant from a sense of divine love,\
3:06\
we can follow this pattern—by doing\
things that bring us closer to God\
3:11\
ourselves and then doing things\
that bring us closer to them—\
3:16\
an unspoken beckoning\
to come unto Christ.\
3:20\
I wish I could sit down with you\
3:22\
and ask you what circumstances\
cause you to feel God's love.\
3:28\
Which verses of scripture, which\
particular acts of service?\
3:31\
Where would you be? What music?\
In whose company?\
3:35\
General conference is a rich place to\
learn about connecting with Heaven’s\
3:39\
love. But perhaps you feel a long\
way from the love of God?\
3:44\
Maybe there is a chorus of\
voices of discouragement\
3:47\
and darkness that weighs\
into your thoughts?\
3:50\
Messages telling you that you’re too\
wounded, confused, too weak and\
3:55\
overlooked, too different or disoriented\
to warrant heavenly love\
3:59\
in any real way. If you hear those\
ideas, then please hear this:\
4:05\
those voices are just wrong.\
4:08\
We can confidently disregard\
brokenness in any way\
4:12\
disqualifying us from heavenly love.\
4:14\
Every time we sing the hymn that\
reminds us that our beloved\
4:18\
and flawless Savior chose\
to be “bruised, broken,\
4:23\
and torn for us.” Every time\
we take broken bread.\
4:27\
Surely Jesus removes all\
shame from the broken.\
4:32\
Through His brokenness,\
He became perfect,\
4:35\
and he can make us perfect in\
spite of our brokenness.\
4:39\
Broken, lonely, torn, and\
bruised He was—\
4:44\
and we may feel we are—but\
separated from the love of God,\
4:47\
we are not.\
“Broken people, perfect love”\
4:51\
as the song goes. You might know\
something secret about yourself that\
4:56\
makes you feel unloveable. However\
4:59\
right you might be about what\
you know about yourself,\
5:02\
you’re wrong to think that you’ve\
put yourself beyond\
5:04\
the reach of God’s love.\
We’re sometimes cruel\
5:07\
and impatient towards ourselves in ways\
that we could never imagine being\
5:11\
towards anyone else. There is much\
for us to do in this life,\
5:15\
but self-loathing and shameful\
self-condemnation are not on that list.\
5:20\
However misshapen we might feel we are,\
His arms are not shortened.\
5:25\
No. They are always long enough\
to “reach our reaching”\
5:30\
and embrace each one of us. When we\
5:33\
don’t feel the warmth of divine love,\
5:36\
it hasn’t gone away. God’s own words\
are that “the mountains shall depart,\
5:42\
and the hills be removed; but [His]\
kindness shall not depart from [us].”\
5:46\
So, just to be clear, the idea that\
God has stopped loving should be\
5:50\
so far down the list of possible\
explanations in life that we don't get\
5:55\
to it until after the mountains have\
left and the hills are gone!\
5:59\
I really enjoy this symbolism of\
mountains being evidence of\
6:03\
the certainty of God's love.\
6:05\
That powerful symbolism weaves into\
accounts of those who go to\
6:09\
the mountains to receive revelation\
6:12\
and Isaiah’s description\
of “the mountain of\
6:14\
the Lord’s house” being “established\
in the top of the mountains.”\
6:19\
The House of the Lord is the home\
of our most precious covenants\
6:23\
and a place for us all to retreat\
and sink deeply into\
6:27\
the evidence of our Father’s\
love for us.\
6:30\
I have also enjoyed the comfort\
that comes to my soul when\
6:33\
I wrap myself more tightly\
in my baptismal covenant\
6:36\
and find someone who’s mourning a loss\
or grieving a disappointment\
6:40\
and I try to help them hold and\
process their feelings.\
6:44\
Are these ways that we can\
become more immersed in\
6:47\
the precious covenantal love, hesed?\
6:51\
So if God's love doesn't leave us,\
why don't we always feel it?\
6:55\
Well, just to manage your expectations:\
I don’t know.\
6:58\
But being loved is definitely not\
the same as feeling loved,\
7:03\
and I have a few thoughts\
that might help you\
7:05\
as you pursue your answer\
to that question.\
7:08\
Perhaps you're wrestling with grief,\
depression, betrayal, loneliness,\
7:14\
disappointment, or other powerful\
intrusion into your ability to feel\
7:19\
God's love for you. If so,\
7:21\
these things can dull or suspend\
our ability to feel\
7:25\
as we might otherwise feel.\
For a season at least,\
7:28\
perhaps you will not be\
able to feel His love,\
7:30\
and knowledge will have to suffice.\
7:33\
But I wonder if you could experiment—\
patiently—with different ways of\
7:38\
expressing and receiving divine love?\
7:41\
Can you take a step back from\
whatever is in front of you\
7:44\
and maybe another step and another\
until you see a wider landscape,\
7:48\
wider and wider still, if necessary,\
7:51\
until you are literally “thinking\
celestial” because you’re looking at\
7:54\
the stars and remembering\
worlds without number\
7:58\
and through them, their Creator?\
Birdsong,\
8:02\
feeling the sun or a breeze\
or rain on my skin,\
8:06\
and times when nature puts\
my senses in awe of God—\
8:09\
each has had a part in providing\
me with heavenly connection.\
8:13\
Perhaps the comfort of faithful friends\
will help? Maybe music? Or serving?\
8:18\
Have you kept a record or journal of\
times when your connection with God was\
8:22\
clearer to you? Perhaps you could\
invite those you trust to share their\
8:26\
sources of divine connection with\
you as you search for relief\
8:30\
and understanding? I wonder: if Jesus\
were to choose a place where you\
8:36\
and He could meet, a private place\
where you’d be able to have\
8:41\
a singular focus on Him, might He choose\
your unique place of personal\
8:47\
suffering, the place of\
your deepest need,\
8:50\
where no one else can go?\
Somewhere you feel\
8:54\
so lonely that you must truly be all\
alone—but you aren’t quite.\
8:59\
A place to which perhaps\
only He has traveled\
9:02\
but actually has already prepared to\
meet you there when you arrive.\
9:07\
If you’re waiting for Him to come,\
9:09\
might He already be there\
and within reach?\
9:13\
If you do feel filled with love\
in this season of your life,\
9:17\
please try and hold on to it as\
effectively as a sieve holds water.\
9:21\
Splash it everywhere you go.\
9:23\
One of the miracles of the divine\
economy is that when we try to share\
9:27\
Jesus love, we find ourselves being\
filled up in a variation of\
9:31\
the principle that “whosoever will lose\
his life for my sake shall find it.”\
9:36\
Being filled with God's love shields\
us in life's storms,\
9:40\
but also makes the happy\
moments happier.\
9:42\
Our joyful days, when there is sunshine\
in the sky, are made even brighter by\
9:47\
the sunshine in our souls.\
9:49\
Let’s become “rooted and grounded”\
in our Jesus and His love.\
9:53\
Let’s look for and treasure experiences\
of feeling His love\
9:56\
and power in our lives. The joy of\
the gospel is available to all—\
10:00\
not just the happy, not\
just the downcast.\
10:03\
Joy is our purpose, not the\
gift of our circumstances.\
10:07\
We have every good reason to “rejoice\
and be filled with love towards God\
10:12\
and all men.” Let’s get full. In the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
