Recently my husband, Greg, received\
a diagnosis that would require\
0:06\
an intensive surgery and\
months of chemotherapy.\
0:10\
Like many of you who have faced\
a similar situation,\
0:13\
we immediately began praying for\
heaven's help and God's power.\
0:19\
The Sunday following Greg's surgery,\
0:21\
the sacrament was delivered\
to our hospital room.\
0:25\
On this occasion, I was the only\
one taking the sacrament.\
0:30\
One piece of bread. One cup of water.\
0:34\
At church, my mind often focuses\
on the delivery system of\
0:38\
the sacrament, the preparing, the\
blessing, and the passing.\
0:42\
But on that afternoon, I pondered\
0:44\
the gift of God's power available to me\
through the sacred ordinance itself\
0:50\
and the covenant promise I was making\
as I took that piece of bread\
0:54\
and that cup of water. This was a time\
when I needed power from heaven in\
1:01\
the midst of great heartache,\
exhaustion, and uncertainty.\
1:04\
I wondered about this gift that\
would allow me to draw upon\
1:09\
the power from Him that I\
so desperately needed.\
1:13\
Partaking of the sacrament would\
increase my companionship with\
1:17\
the Spirit of the Lord, allowing me to\
draw upon the gift of God’s power,\
1:23\
including the ministering of angels and\
1:26\
the Savior's enabling strength\
to overcome.\
1:29\
I don’t think I had ever realized with\
this much clarity before, that it’s\
1:34\
not only who officiates in the\
ordinance that matters,\
1:38\
what the ordinance and our covenant\
promise unlocks also deserves\
1:43\
the focus of our attention.\
1:45\
Priesthood ordinances and covenant\
promises allow God to sanctify us\
1:51\
and then work wonders in our lives.\
But how does this happen?\
1:57\
First, in order for an ordinance to\
manifest the power of God in our lives,\
2:02\
it must be done with authority\
from the Son of God.\
2:07\
The delivery system is important.\
2:10\
The Father entrusted Jesus Christ with\
the keys and authority to oversee\
2:15\
the delivery of His priesthood\
ordinances. Under His direction,\
2:20\
within the order of His priesthood,\
2:23\
the sons of God have been ordained to\
stand in place of the Son of God.\
2:32\
Second, we don't just make covenant\
promises, we must keep them.\
2:38\
In many gospel ordinances, we make\
sacred covenants with God;\
2:42\
He promises to bless us as\
we keep those covenants.\
2:46\
Do we realize it is the combination\
of priesthood ordinances,\
2:51\
along with the keeping\
of covenant promises,\
2:54\
that allows us to  draw\
upon God’s power?\
2:58\
That afternoon I wondered if I,\
a covenant daughter of God,\
3:04\
fully understood how to access\
3:06\
the gift of God’s power through\
priesthood ordinances\
3:10\
and if I truly recognized how\
God’s power works within me.\
3:16\
In 2019, a prophetic invitation\
was extended to the women of\
3:21\
the Church teaching us how to draw the\
Savior’s power into our lives.\
3:26\
President Russell M. Nelson invited us\
to study Doctrine and Covenants 25,\
3:32\
a revelation given to Emma Smith\
in Harmony, Pennsylvania.\
3:38\
Accepting that invitation\
changed my life.\
3:43\
Last month I had an unexpected\
opportunity to visit Harmony. There,\
3:49\
under the maple trees, the priesthood\
was restored to Joseph Smith\
3:53\
and Oliver Cowdery. Close to those\
trees is the front door of Joseph\
3:58\
and Emma’s home. Across from\
the fireplace in that home\
4:02\
there is a window. I stood\
at that window\
4:06\
and wondered what Emma might have\
thought as she looked out across\
4:10\
the trees. In July of 1830, Emma was\
26 years old; she was so young.\
4:18\
She was three and a half years\
into her marriage.\
4:21\
She had lost a baby boy—her first.\
4:25\
His little grave is just down\
the lane from her home.\
4:29\
Standing at that window,\
it was not hard\
4:31\
for me to imagine what might\
have filled her thoughts.\
4:35\
Surely she worried about their finances,\
4:38\
about the increasing persecution\
that threatened their safety,\
4:42\
about their future. And yet the work\
of God was everywhere around her.\
4:49\
Did she also wonder about\
her place in the plan,\
4:53\
her purpose in His kingdom, and her\
potential in the eyes of God?\
5:00\
I think she may have.\
Just across the way,\
5:04\
the gift of God's priesthood authority\
and keys had been restored to\
5:08\
the earth. This was a time when Emma\
actually needed power from heaven.\
5:13\
In the midst of great heartache,\
exhaustion, and uncertainty,\
5:17\
I imagine Emma wondered about this gift\
of God's priesthood that could unlock\
5:23\
the power from Him that she\
so desperately needed.\
5:27\
But Emma didn't just stand at\
that window and wonder.\
5:31\
While the Prophet Joseph was being\
tutored in keys, offices, ordinances,\
5:36\
and how to assist in the service\
of the priesthood,\
5:38\
the Lord Himself, through His prophet,\
gave a revelation to Emma,\
5:44\
Not Nauvoo Relief Society\
President Emma—\
5:47\
this revelation was given to 26-year-old\
Emma in Harmony.\
5:51\
Through revelation,\
5:53\
Emma would learn about the\
inward sanctification\
5:56\
and covenant connection\
that would increase\
5:59\
the ability of those priesthood\
ordinances to work in her life.\
6:03\
First, the Lord reminded Emma\
of her place in His plan,\
6:08\
including who she was and Whose she\
was—a daughter in His kingdom.\
6:14\
She was invited to “walk\
the paths of virtue,”\
6:18\
a path that included ordinances\
that would unlock God’s power\
6:22\
if Emma held on to her covenants.\
Second, in her season of deep mourning,\
6:28\
the Lord gave her purpose.\
6:31\
Emma didn’t just have a front\
row seat to the Restoration,\
6:34\
she was an essential participant\
in the work taking place.\
6:38\
She would be set apart to “expound\
scriptures, and to exhort the church.”\
6:43\
Her time would “be given to writing,\
and to learning much.”\
6:47\
Emma was given a sacred\
role to help prepare\
6:50\
the Saints to worship; their songs\
6:53\
unto the Lord would be received\
as prayers and [would be] “answered with\
6:57\
a blessing upon their heads.”\
6:59\
Last, the Lord outlined a process of\
inward sanctification that would\
7:04\
prepare Emma for exaltation.\
7:07\
“Except thou do this,” the Lord\
explained to her,\
7:10\
“where I am you cannot come.”\
7:13\
If we read section 25 carefully,\
7:16\
we discover an important progression\
taking place.\
7:20\
Emma would go from being a daughter in\
the kingdom, to “elect lady”, to queen.\
7:26\
Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood\
ordinances combined with\
7:30\
the keeping of her covenant promises\
7:32\
would increase her companionship with\
the Spirit and with angels,\
7:37\
empowering her to navigate her life with\
divine guidance. Through His divine\
7:42\
power, God would heal her heart,\
enlarge her capacity,\
7:46\
and transform her into the version of\
herself He knew she could become.\
7:52\
And through the ordinances of\
the Melchizedek priesthood,\
7:55\
“the power of godliness [would\
be] manifest” in her life,\
7:59\
and the Lord would part the veil\
8:01\
so she could receive understanding\
from Him.\
8:05\
This is what it looks like to work for\
God's power to work within us.\
8:12\
President Russell M. Nelson taught:\
8:15\
“Everything that\
happened [in Harmony] has\
8:17\
profound implications implications\
for your lives.\
8:21\
The restoration of the priesthood, along\
with the Lord’s counsel to Emma,\
8:26\
can guide and bless each of you.\
8:29\
Accessing the power of God in your life\
requires the same things that\
8:34\
the Lord instructed Emma\
and each of [us] to do.”\
8:39\
There were important things happening on\
both sides of that window in Harmony,\
8:45\
including the revelation given\
to the elect lady\
8:49\
whom the Lord had called—a revelation\
that would strengthen, encourage,\
8:54\
and instruct Emma Smith, God's daughter.\
8:57\
When our granddaughter Isabelle was\
given a name and a blessing,\
9:01\
her father blessed her with\
an understanding of\
9:04\
the priesthood, that she would continue\
to grow in and learn about\
9:08\
the blessing it would\
provide in her life,\
9:10\
and that her faith in the\
priesthood would grow\
9:13\
as she continued to grow\
in understanding.\
9:16\
It is not often a little girl is blessed\
to understand the priesthood\
9:20\
and to learn how those\
priesthood ordinances\
9:23\
and covenant promises will help\
her to access God's power.\
9:27\
But I remembered Emma and thought\
to myself, Why not?\
9:32\
This tiny daughter has the potential to\
become an elect lady in His kingdom\
9:37\
and eventually a queen. Through\
His priesthood ordinances and\
9:41\
the keeping of her covenant promises,\
9:43\
God's power will work in and through her\
to help her overcome whatever life\
9:50\
brings and become the woman\
God knows she can become.\
9:54\
This is something I want each girl\
in the kingdom to understand.\
10:00\
Live up to your privileges.\
10:03\
Learn how priesthood ordinances\
10:05\
and covenant promises will allow God's\
power to flow into your life with\
10:10\
greater efficacy, working\
in and through you,\
10:14\
empowering and equipping you to\
reach your full potential.\
10:18\
Carefully study and ponder\
the Aaronic and\
10:21\
the Melchizedek Priesthood ordinances,\
10:24\
the covenant promises we\
make with each, and\
10:27\
the power of God we access\
through those ordinances.\
10:31\
Remember, it’s not only who officiates\
in the ordinance that matters;\
10:36\
what the ordinance and your covenant\
promise unlocks also deserves\
10:41\
the focus of your attention.\
10:44\
Partaking of the bread and water is\
10:46\
a weekly reminder of His power working\
in you to help you overcome. Wearing\
10:52\
the garment of the holy priesthood\
is a daily reminder of\
10:56\
the gift of His power working\
in you to help you become.\
11:00\
We all have access to the gift of God’s\
power. Every time we partake of\
11:05\
the sacrament. Every time we cross\
the threshold of a temple.\
11:10\
This is the highlight of my Sabbath.\
This is why I cherish my temple\
11:17\
recommend. “In the ordinances thereof,\
the power of godliness is manifest.”\
11:25\
Of this gift I bear witness, in\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
