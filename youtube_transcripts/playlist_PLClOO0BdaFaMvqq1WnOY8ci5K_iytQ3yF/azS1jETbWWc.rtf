To the many testimonies\
at this conference,\
0:04\
I add my apostolic witness that Jesus\
Christ is the Son of God,\
0:08\
our Lord and Savior, the Redeemer\
of all of our Father’s children.\
0:14\
By His Atonement, Jesus Christ\
made it possible for us,\
0:19\
if we are worthy, to return to the\
presence of our Father in Heaven\
0:23\
and be with our families for eternity.\
0:27\
The Savior is not absent from\
our mortal journeys.\
0:31\
For the past two days, we have heard Him\
speak through His chosen leaders\
0:35\
that we might draw closer to Him. Time\
and again, with His pure love and mercy,\
0:41\
He sustains us as we face\
the drama of life.\
0:46\
Nephi describes, “My God\
hath been my support; He hath\
0:50\
led me through mine afflictions ....\
He hath filled me with his love.”\
0:56\
That love is evident when we sustain\
one another in this work.\
1:03\
We sustain our living prophet\
1:05\
at general conference and\
the First Presidency,\
1:08\
the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,\
General Authorities\
1:11\
and Officers of the Church.\
1:13\
To sustain means to hold up another\
person, to give them our attention,\
1:20\
to be faithful to their trust,\
to act upon their words.\
1:25\
They speak by inspiration of the Lord.\
1:28\
They understand the current issues,\
the moral decline of society,\
1:33\
and the adversary’s increasing efforts\
to thwart the Father’s plan.\
1:40\
In holding up our hands, we are\
committing our support not just\
1:45\
for that moment, but in our daily lives.\
1:49\
Sustaining includes holding up our\
stake presidents and bishops,\
1:54\
quorum and organization leaders,\
teachers,\
1:58\
and even camp directors in\
our wards and stakes.\
2:02\
Closer to home, we hold up our wives and\
our husbands, children, parents,\
2:08\
extended family, and neighbors.\
2:11\
When we hold up one another, we\
are saying, “I am here for you.\
2:16\
Not just to hold up your arms and\
hands when they hang down,\
2:21\
but to comfort and strengthen, adding\
strength at your side.”\
2:27\
The concept to hold up is rooted in\
scripture. At the waters of Mormon, the\
2:32\
newly baptized Church members committed\
“to bear one another’s burdens,\
2:38\
that they may be light;...[to] comfort\
those that stand in need of comfort,\
2:44\
and to stand as witnesses of God\
at all times and in all things,\
2:49\
and in all places.” To the Nephites\
2:53\
Jesus said, “Hold up your light that\
it may shine unto the world.\
2:59\
Behold, I am the light which\
ye shall hold up.”\
3:03\
We hold up the Lord's light when\
we hold fast to our covenants,\
3:08\
and when we support our dear living\
prophet as he speaks the words of God.\
3:14\
President Russell M. Nelson said\
when serving in the Quorum of\
3:18\
the Twelve Apostles, “Our sustaining\
of prophets is\
3:22\
a personal commitment that we will do\
our utmost to uphold their prophetic\
3:28\
priorities.” To hold up the\
prophet is a sacred work.\
3:33\
We do not sit quietly by, but actively\
defend him, follow his counsel,\
3:40\
teach his words, and pray for him.\
3:45\
King Benjamin in the Book of\
Mormon said to the people,\
3:48\
“I am like as yourselves, subject to\
all manner of infirmities in body\
3:55\
and mind; yet I have been chosen ...\
3:58\
and was suffered by the\
hand of the Lord ...\
4:01\
and have been kept and preserved by his\
matchless power to serve you with\
4:07\
all the might, mind, and strength which\
the Lord hath granted unto me.”\
4:13\
Likewise, at age 100, President Nelson\
has been kept and preserved by\
4:20\
the Lord. President Harold B. Lee,\
4:23\
at the time a member of\
the First Presidency,\
4:26\
cited the example of Moses standing\
atop the hill at Rephidim.\
4:33\
“The hands of [the President of the\
church] may grow weary,” he said.\
4:37\
“They may tend to droop at times because\
of his heavy responsibilities;\
4:43\
but as we uphold his hands and as we\
lead under his direction, by his side,\
4:50\
the gates of hell will not prevail\
against you and against Israel.\
4:55\
Your safety and ours depends upon\
whether or not we follow the ones whom\
5:01\
the Lord has placed to preside\
over His Church. He\
5:06\
knows whom He wants to preside over His\
Church, and He will make no mistake.”\
5:12\
End quote. President Nelson draws\
upon years of serving the Lord.\
5:18\
His maturity, wide-ranging experience,\
wisdom,\
5:22\
and consistent receipt of revelation\
is specifically suited for our day.\
5:28\
He has said, “The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints is preparing\
5:34\
the world for the day when the earth\
shall be full of the knowledge of\
5:39\
the Lord. This work is empowered by a\
5:43\
divine announcement made 200 years ago.\
It consisted of only seven words:\
5:50\
’This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!”\
5:55\
President Nelson has also said, “There\
has never been a time in\
5:59\
the history of the world when knowledge\
of our Savior is more personally vital\
6:05\
and relevant to every human soul.\
6:08\
Imagine how quickly the devastating\
conflicts throughout the world—\
6:14\
and those in our individual lives—would\
be resolved if we all chose to follow\
6:20\
Jesus Christ and heed His teachings.”\
6:25\
Dear brothers and sisters, we need to\
do more lifting and less murmuring;\
6:32\
more upholding the word of the Lord, His\
ways, and His prophet, who has said,\
6:39\
“One of our greatest challenges today\
is distinguishing between\
6:43\
the truths of God and the\
counterfeits of Satan.\
6:47\
That is why the Lord warned\
us ’to pray always, ...\
6:51\
that [we] may conquer Satan,\
and ... escape the hands of\
6:55\
the servants of Satan that do\
uphold [the adversary’s] work.”\
7:01\
Last April, Sister Rasband and I had\
7:04\
the honor of joining our beloved\
prophet and Sister Nelson for\
7:09\
the rededication of the\
Manti Utah Temple.\
7:13\
President Nelson surprised everyone\
when he entered the room.\
7:17\
Only a very few of us knew he\
was coming. In his presence,\
7:22\
I immediately felt the light and\
prophetic mantle he carries.\
7:27\
The look of joy on the\
faces of the people\
7:30\
personally seeing the prophet\
will stay with me forever.\
7:35\
In the prayer of rededication,\
7:37\
President Nelson petitioned\
7:39\
the Lord that His holy house would\
essentially hold up all who entered the\
7:45\
temple, “that they may receive sacred\
blessings and remain worthy\
7:51\
and faithful to their covenants ...\
7:53\
that this may be a house of peace,\
a house of comfort,\
7:57\
and a house of personal revelation for\
all who enter these doors worthily.”\
8:04\
We all need to be lifted up by\
the Lord with peace, comfort,\
8:09\
and, most of all, with personal\
revelation to counter the fear,\
8:13\
darkness, and contention encompassing\
the world.\
8:18\
Before the service, we stood outside\
in the sun with President\
8:23\
and Sister Nelson to view\
the beautiful setting.\
8:26\
President Nelson's ancestral\
ties to the area run deep.\
8:32\
His eight great-grandparents settled in\
the valleys surrounding the temple,\
8:37\
as did some of mine. My\
great-grandfather,\
8:41\
Andrew Anderson, served on\
8:43\
the construction crew of early pioneers\
who labored 11 years to complete\
8:49\
the Manti Temple, the third\
in the Rocky Mountains.\
8:53\
As we stood with President Nelson,\
8:56\
we had the opportunity to\
hold up and support\
9:00\
the Prophet of God in celebration of the\
rededication of the Lord's house.\
9:05\
It was a day I will never forget.\
9:10\
“We build temples to honor the Lord,”\
President Nelson said that sacred day.\
9:15\
“They are built for worship\
and not for show.\
9:19\
We make sacred covenants of eternal\
significance inside these sacred walls.”\
9:25\
We are gathering Israel.\
President Nelson and\
9:30\
the prophets before him have cradled\
the holy temples in their arms.\
9:35\
Today, around the world, we\
have 350 sacred houses of\
9:40\
the Lord that are operating, announced,\
or under construction. As prophet,\
9:46\
since 2018 President Nelson\
has announced 168\
9:52\
temples. “In our time,” he has\
said, “a whole, complete,\
9:58\
and perfect union of all dispensations,\
10:01\
keys, and powers are to be welded\
together. For these sacred purposes,\
10:08\
holy temples now dot the earth.\
10:11\
I emphasize again that construction of\
these temples may not change your life,\
10:18\
but your service in the\
temple surely will.”\
10:21\
“The Savior and His doctrine are\
the very heart of the temple,”\
10:26\
the president says. “Everything\
taught in the temple,\
10:30\
through instruction and\
through the Spirit,\
10:32\
increases our understanding\
of Jesus Christ. ...\
10:38\
His essential ordinances bind us to Him\
through sacred priesthood covenants.\
10:44\
Then, as we keep our covenants,\
He endows us with His healing,\
10:50\
strengthening power.” “All who worship\
in the temple,” President Nelson has\
10:56\
said “will have the power of God and\
angels having ‘charge over them.’\
11:01\
How much does it increase your\
confidence to know that as\
11:06\
an endowed woman or a man [or temple-\
attending youth] armed with\
11:11\
the power of God, you do not\
have to face life alone?\
11:15\
What courage does it give you to know\
that angels will really help you?”\
11:21\
Angels reaching out to hold us up\
as described in the scriptures\
11:25\
when Jesus Christ knelt humbly in\
11:28\
the Garden of Gethsemane.\
By His suffering,\
11:31\
He provided an infinite Atonement.\
11:33\
“There,” President Nelson states,\
11:36\
“the greatest single act of love of all\
recorded history took place. ... There\
11:42\
at Gethsemane, the Lord ’suffered\
the pain of all men, that all ...\
11:45\
might repent and come unto him.”\
“Remove this cup from me;”\
11:51\
Jesus Christ asked, “Nevertheless,\
not my will, but thine be done.\
11:56\
And there appeared an angel unto him\
from heaven, strengthening him.”\
12:02\
We have angels round about us today.\
12:05\
President Nelson has said, “[In the\
temple] you will learn how to part\
12:09\
the veil between heaven and earth, how\
to ask for God’s angels to attend you.”\
12:15\
Angels bring light—God’s light.\
To the Nephite apostles\
12:20\
Jesus said, “Behold, I am the light\
which ye shall hold up.”\
12:25\
As we sustain our prophet, we testify\
12:30\
he is called of our Savior, who\
is “the light ... of the world.”\
12:36\
Dear President Nelson, on behalf\
of the members and friends of\
12:41\
the Lord's Church throughout the world,\
12:44\
we feel blessed to hold\
up your teachings,\
12:47\
to hold up your example\
of Christlike living,\
12:50\
and to hold up your fervent testimony\
of our Lord and Savior,\
12:56\
the Redeemer of us all. I bear my\
apostolic witness that Jesus Christ is\
13:04\
the Light of the World. May\
we all, as His disciples,\
13:08\
hold up His light. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
