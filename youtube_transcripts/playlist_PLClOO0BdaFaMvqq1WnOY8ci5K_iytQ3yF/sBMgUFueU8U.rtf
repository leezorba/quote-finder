The Book of Mormon records that\
approximately 90 years before\
0:05\
the birth of Christ, the sons of\
King Mosiah began what would be\
0:09\
a 14-year mission to the Lamanites.\
0:13\
Unsuccessful efforts had been made\
over many generations to bring\
0:17\
the Lamanite people to a belief\
in the doctrine of Christ.\
0:21\
This time, however, through the\
miraculous interventions of\
0:26\
the Holy Spirit, thousands of\
the Lamanites were converted\
0:30\
and became disciples of Jesus Christ.\
0:33\
We read, “And as sure as the Lord\
liveth, so sure as many as believed,\
0:39\
or as many as were brought to the\
knowledge of the truth, through\
0:43\
the preaching of Ammon and his brethren,\
0:46\
according to the spirit of\
revelation and prophecy,\
0:49\
and the power of God working\
miracles in them—\
0:52\
Yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth,\
0:54\
as many of the Lamanites as believed\
in their preaching,\
0:58\
and were converted unto the Lord,\
never did fall away.”\
1:02\
The key to the enduring conversion of\
this people is stated in the next verse:\
1:07\
“For they became a righteous people;\
1:10\
they did lay down the weapons\
of their rebellion,\
1:12\
that they did not fight\
against God any more,\
1:15\
neither against any of their brethren.”\
1:18\
This reference to “weapons of rebellion”\
was both literal and figurative.\
1:23\
It meant their swords and\
other weapons of war,\
1:26\
but also their disobedience to\
God and His commandments.\
1:31\
The king of these converted Lamanites\
expressed it this way:\
1:35\
“And now, behold, my brethren, ...\
1:36\
it has been all we could do to\
repent of all our sins and\
1:40\
the many murders which\
we have committed,\
1:42\
and to get God to take them\
away from our hearts,\
1:45\
for it was all we could do to repent\
sufficiently before God that he would\
1:49\
take away our stain.” Note\
1:53\
the King’s words—their sincere\
repentance had led not only to\
1:57\
forgiveness of their sins,\
1:59\
but God also took away the stain\
of those sins and even\
2:03\
the desire to sin from their hearts.\
2:06\
As you know, rather than risk any\
possible return to their prior state of\
2:10\
rebellion against God, they\
buried their swords.\
2:14\
And as they buried their physical\
weapons with changed hearts,\
2:17\
they also buried their\
disposition to sin.\
2:21\
We might ask ourselves, what could\
we do to follow this pattern? To\
2:25\
“lay down the weapons of [our]\
rebellion,” whatever they may be,\
2:30\
and become so converted to the Lord that\
the stain of sin and the desire\
2:34\
for sin are taken away from our hearts,\
and we will never fall away?\
2:40\
Rebellion can be active or passive.\
2:43\
The classic example of willful\
rebellion is Lucifer,\
2:47\
who in the premortal world opposed\
the Father’s plan of redemption\
2:50\
and rallied others to oppose it as well.\
2:53\
“And, at that day, many\
followed after him.”\
2:56\
It's not hard to discern the impact of\
his continuing rebellion in our own\
3:01\
time. The Book of Mormon’s unholy trio\
of anti-Christs—Sherem, Nehor,\
3:08\
and Korihor—provide a classic study\
of active rebellion against God.\
3:14\
The overarching thesis of Nehor and\
Korihor was that there is no sin;\
3:18\
therefore, there is no need for\
repentance, and there is no Savior.\
3:22\
“Every man prosper[s] according\
to his genius,\
3:25\
and ... every man conquer[s] according\
to his strength;\
3:29\
and whatsoever a man\
[does is] no crime.”\
3:33\
The anti-Christ rejects\
religious authority,\
3:36\
characterizing ordinances and covenants\
3:39\
as performances laid down by ancient\
priests to usurp power and authority.\
3:47\
A latter day example of willful\
rebellion with a happier ending is\
3:51\
the story of William W. Phelps.\
3:54\
Phelps joined the Church in 1831 and\
was appointed Church printer.\
3:59\
He edited several early Church\
publications, wrote numerous hymns,\
4:03\
and served as a scribe to Joseph Smith.\
4:07\
Unfortunately, he turned against\
the Church and the Prophet,\
4:11\
even to the point of giving false\
testimony against Joseph Smith in\
4:15\
a Missouri court, which contributed to\
the Prophet's imprisonment there.\
4:20\
Later, Phelps wrote to Joseph, asking\
for forgiveness. “I know my situation,\
4:26\
you know it, and God knows it,\
4:28\
and I want to be saved if\
my friends will help me.”\
4:32\
In his reply, the Prophet stated,\
4:35\
“It is true that we have suffered much\
in consequence of your behavior. ...\
4:40\
However, the cup has been drunk,\
4:43\
the will of our Heavenly Father has\
been done, and we are yet alive. ...\
4:47\
Come on, dear brother, since\
the war is past, ...\
4:51\
for friends at first are our friends\
again at last.” with sincere repentance,\
4:57\
William Phelps buried his\
“weapons of rebellion”\
5:00\
and was received once more in full\
fellowship, never again to fall away.\
5:06\
Perhaps the more insidious form of\
rebellion against God, however,\
5:10\
is the passive version—ignoring\
His will in our lives.\
5:16\
Many who would never consider active\
rebellion may still oppose the will\
5:20\
and the word of God by pursuing their\
own path without regard to divine\
5:26\
direction. I'm reminded of\
5:29\
the song made famous years ago\
by singer Frank Sinatra,\
5:33\
with the climactic line, “I did it\
my way.” I’d sing it for you,\
5:39\
but better not. Certainly in\
life there's plenty of room\
5:45\
for personal preference\
and individual choice.\
5:49\
But when it comes to matters of\
salvation and eternal life,\
5:54\
our theme song ought to be:\
“I did it God’s way,”\
5:59\
because truly there is no other way.\
6:02\
Take, for instance, the Savior's\
example regarding baptism.\
6:06\
He submitted to baptism as a\
demonstration of loyalty to\
6:10\
the Father and as an example to us:\
6:14\
“He showeth unto the children of men\
6:16\
that, according to the flesh, he\
humbleth himself before the Father,\
6:20\
and witnesseth unto the Father\
6:23\
that he would be obedient unto him\
in keeping his commandments. ...\
6:28\
And he said unto the children\
of men: Follow thou me.\
6:31\
Wherefore, my beloved brethren,\
6:33\
can we follow Jesus save we shall be\
willing to keep the commandments of\
6:37\
the Father?” There is no “my way”\
6:41\
if we’re to follow Christ’s example.\
6:45\
Trying to find a different course to\
heaven is like the futility of working\
6:49\
on the Tower of Babel, rather than\
looking to Christ and His salvation.\
6:55\
The swords and other weapons that\
6:57\
the Lamanite converts buried\
were weapons of rebellion\
7:00\
because of how they had used them.\
7:03\
Those same kinds of weapons in\
the hands of their sons,\
7:06\
being used in defense of\
family and freedom,\
7:10\
were not weapons of rebellion\
against God at all.\
7:14\
The same was true of such weapons\
in the hands of the Nephites:\
7:18\
“They were not fighting for\
monarchy nor power\
7:21\
but were fighting for their\
homes and their liberties,\
7:23\
their wives and their children,\
and their all, yea,\
7:27\
for their rites of worship\
and their church.”\
7:32\
In this same way, there are things\
in our lives that may be neutral\
7:36\
or even inherently good,\
but that used in\
7:40\
the wrong way become weapons\
of rebellion.\
7:44\
Our speech, for example, can edify\
or demean. As James said,\
7:51\
“But the tongue [it seems]\
can no man tame;\
7:55\
it is an unruly evil, full\
of deadly poison.\
8:00\
Therewith bless we God,\
even the Father;\
8:03\
and therewith curse we men, which are\
made after the similitude of God.\
8:09\
Out of the same mouth proceedeth\
blessing and cursing.\
8:13\
My brethren, these things\
ought not so to be.”\
8:19\
There's much in public and personal\
discourse today that is malicious\
8:23\
and mean-spirited. There’s much\
conversation that is vulgar and profane,\
8:28\
even among youth. This sort of speech is\
a weapon of rebellion against God,\
8:34\
“full of deadly poison.” Consider\
another example of something that is\
8:40\
essentially good, but that could be\
turned against divine directives:\
8:46\
a person’s career. One can find real\
satisfaction in a profession,\
8:51\
a vocation, or service. And all of\
us are benefited by what devoted\
8:56\
and talented people in many fields of\
endeavor have accomplished and created.\
9:02\
Still, it is possible that devotion\
to a career can become\
9:07\
the paramount focus of one's life.\
9:10\
Then all else becomes secondary,\
9:13\
including any claim the Savior may\
make on one's time and talent.\
9:18\
For men, and for women as well,\
9:21\
foregoing legitimate opportunities\
for marriage,\
9:24\
failing to cleave to and\
lift one’s spouse,\
9:28\
failing to nurture one's children,\
9:31\
or even intentionally avoiding\
the blessing\
9:34\
and responsibility of childbearing\
solely for\
9:38\
the sake of career advancement\
9:41\
can convert laudable achievement\
into a form of rebellion.\
9:46\
Another example concerns\
our physical being.\
9:51\
Paul reminds us that we are to glorify\
God in both body and spirit,\
9:56\
and that this body is the temple of the\
Holy Ghost, “which ye have of God,\
10:01\
and ye are not your own.” Thus,\
10:04\
we have a legitimate interest in\
spending time caring for our bodies\
10:08\
as best we can. Few of us will reach\
10:11\
the peak of performance\
we've seen recently in\
10:13\
the achievements of athletics of Olympic\
and Paralympic athletes.\
10:18\
Some of us are experiencing\
the effects of age,\
10:21\
or what President M. Russell Ballard\
called, “The rivets coming loose.”\
10:27\
Nevertheless, I believe it pleases our\
Creator when we do our best to care\
10:31\
for this wonderful gift\
of a physical body.\
10:34\
It would be a mark of rebellion to\
deface or defile one's body,\
10:38\
or abuse it, or fail to do what one can\
to pursue a healthy lifestyle. At\
10:44\
the same time, vanity has become—\
10:46\
and becoming consumed with one's\
physique, appearance,\
10:49\
or dress—can be a form of rebellion\
at the other extreme,\
10:53\
leading one to worship God's\
gift instead of God.\
10:59\
In the end, burying our weapons of\
rebellion against God simply means\
11:04\
yielding to the enticings of the Holy\
Spirit, putting off the natural man,\
11:10\
and becoming a saint “through the\
Atonement of Christ the Lord.”\
11:14\
It means putting the first commandment\
first in our lives.\
11:19\
It means letting God prevail.\
11:23\
If our love of God and our determination\
to serve Him with all our\
11:28\
might, mind, and strength become\
11:31\
the touchstone by which we judge all\
things and make all our decisions,\
11:37\
we will have buried our\
weapons of rebellion.\
11:42\
By the grace of Christ, God will forgive\
our sins and rebellions of\
11:46\
the past, and will take away\
the stain of those sins\
11:50\
and rebellions from our hearts.\
11:52\
In time, He’ll even take away\
any desire for evil,\
11:57\
as He did with those Lamanite\
converts of the past.\
12:01\
Thereafter, we too\
“never [will] fall away.”\
12:06\
Burying our weapons of\
rebellion leads to\
12:09\
a unique joy. With all who’ve ever\
become “converted to the Lord,”\
12:15\
we’re “brought to sing the\
song of redeeming love.”\
12:19\
Our Heavenly Father and\
His Son, our Redeemer,\
12:22\
have confirmed their unending commitment\
to our ultimate happiness\
12:27\
through the most profound\
love and sacrifice.\
12:32\
We experience Their love daily.\
12:36\
Surely we can reciprocate with\
our own love and loyalty.\
12:42\
May we bury very, very deep any element\
of rebellion against God in our lives\
12:49\
and replace it with a willing\
heart and a willing mind.\
12:53\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
