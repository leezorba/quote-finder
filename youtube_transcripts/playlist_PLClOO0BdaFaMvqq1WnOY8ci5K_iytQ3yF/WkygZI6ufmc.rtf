Several years ago, my wife and I served\
as mission leaders in Tokyo,\
0:04\
Japan. During a visit to our mission,\
by then-Elder Russell M. Nelson,\
0:10\
one of the missionaries asked\
him how best to respond when\
0:13\
a person tells them that they are\
too busy to listen to them.\
0:16\
With little hesitation,\
President Nelson said,\
0:19\
“I would ask if they were too\
busy to eat lunch that day\
0:22\
and then teach them that they have\
both a body and a spirit.\
0:26\
And just as their body will die if not\
nourished, so will their spirit,\
0:32\
if not nourished by the\
good word of God.”\
0:35\
It’s interesting to note that the\
Japanese word for “busy,” “isogashii”,\
0:40\
is made up of a character\
with two symbols.\
0:42\
The one on the left means\
“heart” or “spirit,”\
0:46\
and the one on the right means “death”—\
suggesting, perhaps,\
0:50\
as President Nelson taught,\
0:52\
that being too busy to nourish our\
spirits can lead us to die spiritually.\
0:58\
The Lord knew in this fast-paced world,\
full of distractions and in commotion,\
1:03\
that making quality time\
for Him would be one of\
1:06\
the major challenges of our day.\
1:10\
Speaking through the prophet Isaiah,\
1:12\
He provided these words of counsel\
1:14\
and caution which can\
be likened unto\
1:17\
the tumultuous days in which we live:\
“In returning and rest shall ye be\
1:24\
saved; in quietness and in confidence\
shall be your strength: and ye would\
1:33\
not. But ye said No; for we will flee\
upon horses; therefore shall ye flee:\
1:38\
and, We will ride upon the swift;\
1:41\
therefore shall they that\
pursue you be swift.”\
1:45\
In other words, even though\
our salvation depends\
1:48\
on returning to Him often and resting\
from the cares of the world, we do not.\
1:55\
And even though our confidence\
will come from\
1:58\
a strength developed in quiet times,\
2:01\
sitting with the Lord in meditation\
and reflection, we do not. Why not?\
2:07\
Because we say no. We are busy with\
other things—“fleeing upon our horses,”\
2:12\
so to speak. Therefore, we will get\
further and further away from God.\
2:17\
We will insist on going\
faster and faster.\
2:20\
And the faster we go, the swifter\
Satan will follow in pursuit.\
2:25\
Perhaps this is why President Nelson\
has repeatedly pled with us to make\
2:30\
time for the Lord in our lives,\
each and every day.\
2:34\
He reminds us that “quiet\
time is sacred time—\
2:38\
time that will facilitate personal\
revelation and instill peace.”\
2:43\
But to hear the still voice\
of the Lord, he counseled,\
2:47\
“You too must be still.”\
Being still, however,\
2:52\
requires more than just making\
time for the Lord;\
2:55\
it requires letting go of our doubtful\
and fearful thoughts\
3:00\
and focusing our hearts\
and minds on Him.\
3:04\
Elder David A. Bednar taught, “The\
Lord’s admonition to ‘be still’\
3:08\
entails much more than simply not\
talking or not moving.” “To be still,”\
3:15\
he suggested, “may be a way of reminding\
us to focus upon the Savior\
3:21\
unfailingly.” Unquote. Being still is an\
act of faith and requires effort.\
3:27\
Lectures on Faith states, “When\
a man works by faith,\
3:31\
he works by mental exertion.”\
3:33\
President Nelson declared,\
3:35\
“Our focus must be riveted on\
the Savior and His gospel.\
3:39\
It is mentally rigorous to strive to\
look unto Him in every thought.\
3:44\
But when we do, our doubts\
and fears flee.”\
3:48\
Speaking of this need to focus\
our minds, President David O.\
3:52\
McKay said, “I think we pay too little\
attention to the value of meditation,\
3:57\
a principle of devotion. ...\
Meditation is one of the\
4:01\
... most sacred doors through which we\
pass into the presence of the Lord,”\
4:07\
unquote. There is a word in Japanese\
“mui,” that, for me,\
4:12\
captures this more faith-filled,\
4:13\
contemplative sense of what\
it means to be still.\
4:16\
It's comprised of two characters.\
4:18\
The one on the left means\
“nothing” or “nothingness,”\
4:22\
and the one on the right means “to do.”\
Together they mean “non-doing.”\
4:27\
Taken literally, the word could be\
misinterpreted to mean to do nothing.\
4:32\
In the same way, to be still can be\
misinterpreted as not talking\
4:37\
or moving. However, like\
the phrase “to be still,”\
4:41\
it has a higher meaning for me.\
4:45\
It is a reminder to slow down and to\
live with greater spiritual awareness.\
4:51\
While serving in the Asia North Area\
Presidency with Elder Takashi Wada,\
4:55\
I learned that his wife,\
Sister Naomi Wada,\
4:58\
is an accomplished\
Japanese calligrapher.\
5:01\
I asked Sister Wada if she would draw\
for me the Japanese characters for\
5:05\
the word “mui.” I wanted to hang\
the calligraphy on my wall as\
5:09\
a reminder to be still and\
to focus on the Savior.\
5:13\
I was surprised when she did not readily\
agree to this seemingly simple\
5:17\
request. The next day, knowing that\
5:20\
I had likely misunderstood\
her hesitance,\
5:23\
Elder Wade explained that writing\
those characters would require\
5:27\
a significant effort. She would need to\
ponder and meditate on the concept\
5:33\
and the characters until she understood\
the meaning deeply in her soul\
5:38\
and could give expression to these\
heartfelt impressions with each stroke\
5:43\
of her brush. I was embarrassed\
that I had\
5:47\
so casually asked her to do\
something so demanding.\
5:51\
I asked him to convey my apologies\
to her for my ignorance,\
5:55\
and to let her know that I was\
withdrawing my request.\
5:58\
You can imagine my surprise and\
gratitude when, upon leaving Japan,\
6:04\
Sister Wada, unsolicited,\
6:06\
gifted to me this beautiful piece\
of calligraphy featuring\
6:11\
the Japanese words for the word “mui.”\
6:14\
It now hangs prominently on\
the wall of my office,\
6:17\
reminding me to be still and to seek the\
Lord every day with all my heart,\
6:23\
might, mind, and strength.\
6:26\
She had captured in this selfless act\
the meaning of “mui” or stillness\
6:32\
better than any words could.\
6:34\
Rather than mindlessly and dutifully\
drawing the characters,\
6:39\
she approached her calligraphy with full\
purpose of heart and real intent.\
6:44\
Likewise, God desires that we approach\
our time with Him with\
6:49\
the same kind of heartfelt devotion.\
6:52\
When we do so, our worship becomes an\
expression of our love for Him.\
6:57\
He yearns for us to commune with Him.\
7:00\
On one occasion, after I gave the\
invocation in a meeting with\
7:03\
the First Presidency, President\
Nelson turned to me and said,\
7:06\
“While you were praying, I thought how\
much God must appreciate when we take\
7:10\
time from our busy schedules\
to acknowledge Him.”\
7:13\
It was a simple yet powerful reminder\
of how much it must mean to\
7:17\
the Lord when we pause to commune with\
Him. As much as He desires our\
7:23\
attention, He will not\
force us to come to Him.\
7:26\
To the Nephites, the resurrected\
Lord said,\
7:28\
“How oft would I have gathered\
you as a hen\
7:32\
gathereth her chickens,\
and ye would not?”\
7:35\
He followed that with this hopeful\
invitation that also applies to us\
7:40\
today: “How oft will I gather you as\
7:44\
a hen gathereth her chickens\
under her wings\
7:46\
if ye will repent and return unto\
me with full purpose of heart?”\
7:53\
The gospel of Jesus Christ gives us\
opportunities to return to Him often.\
7:58\
These opportunities include daily\
prayers, scripture study,\
8:02\
the sacrament ordinance, the Sabbath\
day and temple worship.\
8:06\
What if we were to take these sacred\
opportunities off our to do lists\
8:11\
and put them on our non-doing lists?\
8:14\
Meaning to approach them with\
the same mindfulness\
8:17\
and focus with which Sister Wada\
approaches her calligraphy.\
8:21\
You may be thinking, “I don’t have time\
for that.” I have often felt the same.\
8:27\
But let me suggest that what may be\
needed is not necessarily more time,\
8:32\
but more awareness of and focus on God\
during the times we already set aside\
8:37\
for Him. For example, when praying,\
8:40\
what if we were to spend\
less time talking\
8:43\
and more time just being with God?\
8:46\
And when we were to speak,\
8:48\
to give more heartfelt and specific\
expressions of gratitude and love.\
8:55\
President Nelson has counseled that\
we not just read the scriptures,\
8:58\
but savor them. What difference would it\
make if we were to do less reading\
9:04\
and more savoring? What\
if we were to do more\
9:08\
to prepare our minds to partake of\
the sacrament and joyfully ponder\
9:13\
the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus\
Christ during this sacred ordinance?\
9:18\
On the Sabbath, which in\
Hebrew means “rest,”\
9:20\
what if we were to rest\
from other cares\
9:24\
and to take time to sit quietly with the\
Lord, to pay our devotions unto Him?\
9:30\
During our temple worship,\
9:32\
what if we were to make a more\
disciplined effort to pay attention,\
9:35\
or lingered a little longer in the\
celestial room in quiet reflection?\
9:40\
When our focus is less\
on doing and more\
9:43\
on strengthening our covenant connection\
with Heavenly Father\
9:46\
and Jesus Christ, I testify that each\
of these sacred moments will be\
9:50\
enriched, and we will receive\
9:52\
the guidance needed in\
our personal lives.\
9:55\
We, like Martha in the account in Luke,\
9:58\
are often “careful and troubled\
about many things.”\
10:00\
However, as we commune with\
the Lord each day,\
10:04\
He will help us to know that\
which is most needful.\
10:08\
Even the Savior took time from\
His ministry to be still.\
10:12\
The scriptures are replete with examples\
of the Lord retreating to\
10:16\
a solitary place, a mountain, the\
wilderness, a desert place,\
10:22\
or going a little way off\
to pray to the Father.\
10:25\
If Jesus Christ sought quiet\
time to commune with God\
10:30\
and to be strengthened by Him, it would\
be wise for us to do the same.\
10:35\
As we concentrate our hearts and minds\
on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ,\
10:42\
and listen to the still small\
voice of the Holy Ghost,\
10:46\
we will have greater clarity\
about what is most needful,\
10:50\
develop deeper compassion, and find\
rest and strength in Him.\
10:56\
Paradoxically, helping God hasten\
His work of salvation\
10:59\
and exaltation may require\
that we slow down.\
11:03\
Being always in motion may be adding\
to the commotion in our lives\
11:08\
and robbing us of the peace we seek.\
11:12\
I testify that as we return often to the\
Lord with full purpose of heart,\
11:17\
we will, in quietness and confidence,\
come to know Him\
11:21\
and feel His infinite covenantal\
love for us.\
11:25\
The Lord promised, “Draw near unto me,\
and I will draw near unto you;\
11:30\
seek me diligently and\
ye shall find me.”\
11:35\
“And ye shall seek me, and find me,\
11:39\
when ye shall search for\
me with all your heart.”\
11:43\
I testify that this promise is true in\
the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
