The year 2024 is something of\
a milestone year for me.\
0:06\
It marks 75 years since I was\
baptized and confirmed\
0:11\
a member of The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints in Zwickau,\
0:14\
Germany. My membership in the Church\
of Jesus Christ is precious to me.\
0:22\
To be counted among God’s covenant\
people with you,\
0:26\
my brothers and sisters, is one of\
the greatest honors of my life.\
0:31\
When I think about my personal\
journey of discipleship,\
0:35\
my mind often goes back to\
an old villa in Zwickau,\
0:39\
where I have cherished memories of\
attending sacrament meetings of\
0:44\
the Church of Jesus Christ as a child.\
0:47\
It is there where the seedling of my\
testimony received its earliest\
0:52\
nourishing. This chapel had\
an old air-driven organ.\
0:56\
Every Sunday a young man was assigned\
to push up and down\
1:00\
the sturdy lever operating the bellows\
to make the organ work.\
1:05\
I sometimes had the great privilege of\
assisting in this important task. While\
1:12\
the congregation sang our beloved hymns,\
1:14\
I pumped with all my strength so\
1:17\
the organ would not run out of wind.\
From the bellows operator’s seat,\
1:23\
I had a great view of some stunning\
stained glass windows,\
1:28\
one depicting the Savior Jesus Christ\
and another portraying Joseph Smith\
1:34\
in the Sacred Grove. I can still\
remember the sacred feelings I had\
1:40\
as I looked at those sunlit windows\
while listening to the testimonies of\
1:45\
the Saints and singing the hymns\
of Zion. In that holy place,\
1:50\
the Spirit of God bore witness to my\
mind and heart that it was true.\
1:57\
Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world.\
This is His Church.\
2:04\
The Prophet Joseph Smith\
saw God the Father\
2:07\
and Jesus Christ and heard Their voices.\
2:11\
Earlier this year, while on\
assignment in Europe,\
2:14\
I had the opportunity to\
return to Zwickau.\
2:17\
Sadly, that beloved old chapel\
isn't there anymore.\
2:22\
It was torn down many years ago to make\
room for a large apartment building.\
2:28\
I admit that it’s sad to know that this\
beloved building from my childhood\
2:35\
is now just a memory. It was\
a sacred building to me,\
2:39\
but it was just a building.\
2:41\
By contrast, the spiritual\
witness I gained from\
2:46\
the Holy Ghost those many years\
ago has not passed away.\
2:51\
In fact, it has grown stronger.\
2:54\
The things I learned in my youth about\
the fundamental principles of\
2:59\
the gospel of Jesus Christ have been my\
firm foundation throughout my life.\
3:05\
The covenant connection I forged with my\
Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son\
3:11\
has stayed with me long after the\
Zwickau chapel was dismantled and\
3:18\
the stained glass windows were lost.\
3:21\
“Heaven and earth shall pass away,”\
Jesus said,\
3:25\
“but my words shall not pass away.”\
3:28\
“The mountains shall depart,\
and the hills be removed,\
3:33\
but my kindness shall not\
depart from thee,\
3:37\
neither shall the covenant of my peace\
be removed, saith the Lord.”\
3:42\
One of the most important things\
we can learn in this life is\
3:46\
the difference between what is\
eternal and what is not.\
3:51\
Once we understand that, everything\
changes—our relationships,\
3:56\
the choices we make, the\
way we treat people.\
4:00\
Knowing what is eternal and what\
is not is key to growing\
4:05\
a testimony of Jesus Christ\
and His Church.\
4:10\
The restored gospel of\
Jesus Christ, as the\
4:12\
Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Embrace[s]\
all, and every item of truth.”\
4:18\
But that doesn’t mean that all truth\
is of equal value.\
4:24\
Some truths are core, essential,\
at the root of our faith.\
4:29\
Others are appendages or branches—\
valuable,\
4:33\
but only when they are connected\
to the fundamentals.\
4:37\
The Prophet Joseph also said,\
4:40\
“The fundamental principles of our\
religion are the testimony of\
4:43\
the apostles and prophets,\
concerning Jesus Christ,\
4:46\
that he died, was buried, and\
rose again the third day,\
4:51\
and ascended into heaven;\
4:52\
and all other things which pertain to\
our religion are only appendages to it.”\
4:58\
In other words. Jesus Christ\
and His atoning sacrifice are\
5:04\
the root of our testimony. All\
other things are branches.\
5:09\
This is not to say that the\
branches are unimportant.\
5:13\
A tree needs branches. But as the\
Savior told His disciples,\
5:18\
“The branch cannot bear fruit of itself,\
except it abide in the vine.” Without\
5:26\
a connection to the Savior, to the\
nourishment found in the roots,\
5:30\
a branch withers and dies. When it comes\
to nourishing our testimonies of\
5:36\
Jesus Christ, I wonder if we sometimes\
mistake the branches for the roots.\
5:42\
This was a mistake Jesus observed\
in the Pharisees of His day.\
5:48\
They paid so much attention to the\
relatively minor details of\
5:52\
the law that they ended up neglecting\
what the Savior called\
5:57\
“the weightier matters”—fundamental\
principles like “justice and mercy\
6:03\
and faith.” If you want\
to nourish a tree,\
6:06\
you don’t splash water on the branches.\
You water the roots.\
6:11\
Similarly, if you want the branches of\
your testimony to grow and bear fruit,\
6:17\
nourish the roots. If you are uncertain\
about a particular doctrine\
6:22\
or practice or element\
of Church history,\
6:26\
seek clarity with faith in Jesus Christ.\
6:30\
Seek to understand His sacrifice\
for you, His love for you,\
6:35\
His will for you. Follow\
Him in humility.\
6:40\
The branches of your testimony will draw\
strength from your deepening faith\
6:46\
in Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son.\
6:50\
For example, if you want a stronger\
testimony of the Book of Mormon,\
6:55\
focus on its witness of Jesus Christ.\
6:59\
Notice how the Book of Mormon testifies\
of Him, what it teaches about Him,\
7:05\
and how it invites and inspires\
you to come unto Him.\
7:10\
If you're seeking a more meaningful\
experience in church meetings or in\
7:15\
the temple, try looking\
for the Savior in\
7:18\
the sacred ordinances we receive there.\
Find the Lord in His holy house.\
7:26\
If you ever feel burned out or\
overwhelmed by your Church calling,\
7:31\
try refocusing your service\
on Jesus Christ.\
7:36\
Make it an expression of\
your love for Him.\
7:41\
Nourish the roots and the branches will\
grow, and in time they will bear fruit.\
7:49\
Strong faith in Jesus Christ doesn’t\
happen overnight. No,\
7:54\
in this mortal world, it’s the thorns\
7:58\
and thistles of doubt that\
grow spontaneously.\
8:02\
The healthy, fruitful tree of faith\
requires intentional effort.\
8:08\
And a vital part of that effort is\
making sure we are firmly rooted in\
8:15\
Christ. For example, at first we may\
be drawn to the Savior's gospel\
8:21\
and Church because we are impressed\
by the friendly members or by\
8:25\
the kind bishop or the clean\
looks of the chapel.\
8:28\
These circumstances are certainly\
important to grow the Church.\
8:33\
Nevertheless, if the roots of our\
testimony never grow deeper than that,\
8:39\
what will happen when we move to\
8:42\
a ward that meets in a less impressive\
building with members who aren’t\
8:48\
so friendly, and the bishop says\
something that offends us?\
8:53\
Another example. Does it seem\
reasonable to hope that if we keep\
8:58\
the commandments and are\
sealed in the temple,\
9:01\
we will be blessed with a large, happy\
family with bright, obedient children,\
9:07\
all of whom stay active in the Church,\
serve missions, sing in the ward choir,\
9:12\
and volunteer to help clean the\
meetinghouse every Saturday morning?\
9:18\
I certainly hope that all of us\
will see this in our lives.\
9:23\
But what if it doesn't happen?\
9:26\
Will we stay bound to the Savior\
regardless of circumstances,\
9:31\
trusting Him and His timing?\
9:33\
We must ask ourselves,\
9:36\
is my testimony based on what\
I hope to happen in my life?\
9:42\
Is it dependent on the actions\
or attitudes of others?\
9:47\
Or is it firmly founded on Jesus Christ,\
“rooted and built up in him,”\
9:55\
regardless of life's changing\
circumstances?\
10:00\
The Book of Mormon tells of a people\
who were strict in observing\
10:05\
the ordinances of God. But then a\
skeptic named Korihor came along,\
10:12\
mocking the Savior’s gospel,\
10:14\
calling it the “foolish” and “silly\
traditions of their fathers.”\
10:19\
Korihor led “away the hearts of many,\
10:23\
causing them to lift up their\
heads in their wickedness.”\
10:27\
But others he could not deceive,\
10:31\
because to them the gospel of Jesus\
Christ was much more than a tradition.\
10:36\
Faith is strong when it has deep\
roots in a personal experience,\
10:41\
a personal commitment to Jesus Christ,\
10:44\
independent of what our traditions\
are or what others may say or do.\
10:50\
Our testimony will be tested and tried.\
Faith is not faith if never tested.\
10:57\
Faith is not strong if never opposed.\
11:02\
So don't despair if you have trials\
of faith or unanswered questions.\
11:10\
We should not expect to understand\
everything before we act.\
11:15\
That is not faith. As Alma taught,\
11:18\
“Faith is not to have a perfect\
knowledge of things.”\
11:22\
If we wait to act until all of\
our questions are answered,\
11:28\
we severely limit the good we\
can accomplish, and we limit\
11:33\
the power of our faith.\
Faith is beautiful\
11:36\
because it persists even when blessings\
don't come as hoped for.\
11:41\
We can’t see the future. We don’t\
know all the answers,\
11:45\
but we can trust Jesus Christ as we\
keep moving forward and upward\
11:51\
because He is our Savior and Redeemer.\
11:56\
Faith endures the trials and\
the uncertainties of life\
12:00\
because it is firmly rooted in\
Christ and His doctrine.\
12:06\
Jesus Christ and our Father in Heaven,\
who sent Him, together\
12:11\
constitute the one undeviating,\
perfectly reliable object of our trust.\
12:19\
A testimony is not something that you\
build once and it stands forever.\
12:24\
It's more like a tree that\
you nourish constantly.\
12:29\
Planting the word of God in your\
heart is only the first step.\
12:34\
Once your testimony starts to grow,\
then the real work begins.\
12:41\
That’s when you “nourish it with great\
care that it may get root,\
12:47\
that it may grow up and\
bring forth fruit.”\
12:51\
It takes “great diligence” and\
“patience with the word.”\
12:56\
But the Lord’s promises are sure:\
12:59\
“Ye shall reap the rewards of faith,\
13:02\
and your diligence and patience\
and long-suffering,\
13:06\
waiting for the tree to bring\
forth fruit unto you.”\
13:10\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
my dear friends,\
13:13\
there is a part of me that misses\
the old Zwickau chapel\
13:19\
and its stained glass windows.\
13:21\
But over the past 75 years,\
13:25\
Jesus Christ has led me on\
13:28\
a journey through life that\
is more thrilling than\
13:32\
I could ever have imagined.\
13:36\
He has comforted me in my afflictions,\
helped me to recognize my weaknesses,\
13:45\
healed my spiritual wounds, and\
nourished me in my growing faith.\
13:53\
It is my sincere prayer and blessing to\
all of you that we will constantly\
13:59\
nourish the roots of our faith in\
the Savior, in His doctrine,\
14:05\
and in His Church. Of this I testify\
in the sacred name of our Savior,\
14:11\
our Redeemer, our Master. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
