All of us have family members we love\
who are being tempted and tried by\
0:09\
the seemingly constant forces\
of Satan the destroyer,\
0:16\
who would make all God's\
children miserable.\
0:21\
For many of us, there have\
been sleepless nights.\
0:27\
We have tried to surround the people\
who are at risk with every force\
0:32\
for good. We have pled in prayer\
for them. We have loved them.\
0:40\
We have set the best example we could.\
0:44\
Alma, a wise prophet from ancient times,\
faced similar trials.\
0:51\
The people he led and loved were\
frequently under attack by\
0:57\
a ferocious enemy. Yet they were still\
trying to rear righteous children in\
1:05\
a world of wickedness. Alma felt\
his only hope of victory was\
1:13\
a force which at times we underestimate\
and often use too little.\
1:21\
He pled for God's help. Alma\
knew that for God to help,\
1:28\
repentance was required by those he\
led as well as his adversaries.\
1:36\
Thus, he opted for a different\
approach to battle.\
1:41\
The Book of Mormon describes\
it this way:\
1:45\
“And now, as the preaching of the word\
had a great tendency to lead\
1:52\
the people to do that\
which was just—yea,\
1:56\
it had ... more powerful effect upon the\
minds of the people than the sword,\
2:02\
or anything else, which had\
happened unto them—\
2:07\
therefore, Alma thought it was\
expedient that he should try\
2:14\
the virtue of the word of God.”\
2:19\
The word of God is the doctrine taught\
by Jesus Christ and by His prophets.\
2:26\
Alma knew that the words of\
doctrine had great power.\
2:33\
In the 18th section of the\
Doctrine and Covenants,\
2:37\
the Lord revealed the foundation\
of His doctrine.\
2:42\
“For behold, I command all men\
everywhere to repent. ...\
2:46\
For behold, the Lord your Redeemer\
suffered death in the flesh;\
2:52\
wherefore he suffered\
the pain of all men,\
2:56\
that all men might repent\
and come unto him.\
3:01\
And he hath risen again from the dead,\
3:04\
that he might bring all men unto him\
on conditions of repentance.”\
3:11\
“And you shall fall down, and worship\
the Father in my name. ...\
3:15\
You must repent and be baptized,\
in the name of Jesus Christ.”\
3:21\
“Ask the Father in my name in faith,\
believing that you shall receive,\
3:28\
and you shall have the Holy Ghost.”\
3:32\
“And now, after ... you\
have received this,\
3:35\
you must keep my commandments\
in all things.”\
3:39\
“Take upon you the name of Christ,\
3:42\
and speak the truth in soberness.\
And as many as repent\
3:48\
and are baptized in my name, which is\
Jesus Christ, and endure to the end,\
3:54\
the same shall be saved.”\
In those few passages,\
4:00\
the Savior gives us the perfect example\
of how we should teach His doctrine.\
4:08\
This doctrine is that faith in the\
Lord Jesus Christ, repentance,\
4:12\
baptism, receiving the gift\
of the Holy Ghost,\
4:16\
and enduring to the end blesses\
all of God's children.\
4:22\
As we teach these principles\
to those we love,\
4:26\
the Holy Ghost will help\
us know the truth.\
4:30\
And because we need the prompting\
of the Holy Ghost,\
4:33\
we must avoid speculation\
4:36\
or personal interpretation that goes\
beyond teaching true doctrine.\
4:43\
That can be hard to do when you love\
the person you are trying to influence.\
4:50\
He or she may have ignored the doctrine\
that has been taught.\
4:56\
It is tempting to try something\
new or sensational,\
5:01\
but the Holy Ghost will reveal\
the truth only\
5:05\
as we are cautious and careful not to\
go beyond teaching true doctrine.\
5:13\
One of the surest ways to avoid even\
getting near false doctrine is to\
5:19\
choose to be simple in our teaching.\
5:23\
Safety is gained by that simplicity,\
and little is lost.\
5:31\
Teaching simply allows us to share\
the saving doctrine early on,\
5:38\
while children remain untouched by\
5:42\
the deceiver’s temptations that will\
later confront them long before\
5:48\
the truths they need to learn\
are drowned out by\
5:52\
the noise of social media, peers, and\
their own personal struggles.\
5:59\
We should seize every\
opportunity to share\
6:04\
the teachings of Jesus\
Christ with children.\
6:10\
These teaching moments are precious\
and far fewer compared to\
6:15\
the relentless efforts\
of opposing forces.\
6:19\
For every hour spent instilling\
doctrine into a child's life,\
6:25\
there are countless hours of opposition\
filled with messages\
6:31\
and images that challenge or\
ignore those saving truths.\
6:39\
Some of you may wonder whether it might\
be better to draw your children closer\
6:46\
to you through having fun.\
6:48\
Or you may ask whether the child may\
start to feel overwhelmed by your\
6:54\
teaching. Instead, we should consider,\
6:59\
“With so little time and\
so few opportunities,\
7:03\
what words of doctrine can I share\
that will strengthen them against\
7:10\
the inevitable challenges\
to their faith?”\
7:14\
The words you share today could be\
the ones they carry with them,\
7:21\
and today will soon pass.\
7:25\
I have always admired my great\
grandmother Mary Bommeli’s devotion to\
7:33\
sharing the doctrine of Jesus Christ.\
7:38\
Her family was taught by missionaries\
in Switzerland when she was 24. After\
7:46\
being baptized, Mary decided to\
join the Saints in America.\
7:53\
So she made her way to Switzerland,\
to Berlin,\
7:58\
and found work with a woman who employed\
her to weave cloth for\
8:04\
the family's clothing. Mary\
lived in a servant's room\
8:10\
and set up her loom in the\
home's living area.\
8:15\
At that time, teaching the doctrine of\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\
8:21\
day Saints was illegal in Berlin.\
8:26\
But Mary found she could not keep from\
sharing the things she had learned.\
8:32\
The woman of the house and her\
friends would gather around\
8:36\
the loom to hear Mary teach.\
8:40\
She spoke of the appearance of Heavenly\
Father and Jesus Christ to Joseph\
8:48\
Smith, the visitation of angels\
and the Book of Mormon,\
8:54\
remembering the accounts of Alma,\
8:57\
she taught about the doctrine\
of the Resurrection.\
9:01\
She testified that families can be\
reunited in the celestial kingdom.\
9:09\
Now Mary’s enthusiasm to share\
the doctrine of\
9:13\
the restored gospel soon caused trouble.\
9:18\
It was not long before the police\
took Mary off to jail.\
9:24\
On the way, she asked the policeman\
for the name of\
9:29\
the judge she was to appear before.\
9:33\
The next morning, she also asked about\
his family and if he was a good father\
9:41\
and husband. The policeman described\
the judge as a man of the world.\
9:48\
In the jail, Mary requested\
a pencil and some paper.\
9:54\
She spent the night writing a letter\
to the judge bearing witness to\
10:00\
the Resurrection of Jesus Christ as\
described in the Book of Mormon,\
10:05\
discussing the spirit world,\
and explaining repentance.\
10:11\
She suggested that the judge\
would need time to reflect\
10:15\
on his life before facing\
final judgment.\
10:22\
She wrote that she knew he\
had much to repent of,\
10:27\
which would deeply sadden his family\
and bring him great sorrow.\
10:36\
In the morning when she had\
finished her letter,\
10:40\
she gave it to the policeman and asked\
him to deliver it to the judge,\
10:45\
and he agreed to do so. Later,\
10:49\
the policeman was summoned by the\
judge to his office.\
10:56\
The letter Mary had written was\
irrefutable evidence that she was\
11:01\
teaching the doctrine of the restored\
gospel, and by so doing,\
11:06\
breaking the law. However,\
11:11\
it wasn't long before the policeman\
returned to Mary's cell.\
11:16\
He told her that all charges were\
dismissed and that she was free to go.\
11:23\
Her teaching the doctrine of the\
restored gospel of Jesus Christ\
11:28\
had caused her to be cast into jail,\
11:32\
and her declaring the doctrine\
of repentance to\
11:36\
the judge got her cast out of jail.\
11:41\
Mary Bommeli’s teaching did\
not end with her release.\
11:47\
The record of her words passing true\
doctrine down through generations\
11:54\
yet unborn. Her belief that even\
a new convert could teach\
12:01\
the doctrine of Jesus Christ has ensured\
that her descendants will be\
12:06\
strengthened in their own battle.\
12:11\
As we do our best to teach those we love\
about the doctrine of Jesus Christ,\
12:17\
some may still not respond. Doubts\
may creep into your mind.\
12:24\
You might question whether you know\
12:27\
the Savior's doctrine well enough\
to teach it effectively.\
12:32\
And if you've already made\
attempts to teach it,\
12:35\
you may wonder why the positive\
effects aren't more visible.\
12:42\
Don’t give in to those doubts.\
Turn to God for help. “Yea,\
12:50\
and cry unto God for all thy support ...\
12:54\
let the affections of thy heart be\
placed upon the Lord forever.”\
13:00\
“And I would that ye should be humble,\
and be submissive and gentle;\
13:06\
easy to be entreated; full of\
patience and long-suffering,\
13:12\
being temperate in all things;\
13:14\
being diligent in keeping the\
commandments of God at all times;\
13:19\
asking for whatsoever things ye stand in\
need, both spiritual and temporal;\
13:25\
always returning thanks unto God for\
whatsoever things you do receive.”\
13:32\
If you pray, if you talk to God,\
13:36\
and if you plead for His help\
for your loved one,\
13:41\
and if you thank Him not only for help,\
13:44\
but for the patience and gentleness that\
come from not receiving all you\
13:50\
desire right away, or perhaps ever,\
13:55\
then I promise you that you\
will draw closer to Him.\
14:00\
You will become diligent\
and long-suffering,\
14:04\
and then you can know that you have done\
all that you can to help those you\
14:10\
love and those you pray to navigate\
through Satan’s attempt to derail them.\
14:20\
“But they that wait upon the Lord\
shall renew their strength;\
14:25\
and they shall mount up\
with wings as eagles;\
14:31\
and they shall run and not be weary;\
and they shall walk and not faint.”\
14:39\
You can find hope in the scriptural\
record of families.\
14:43\
We read of those who turned away\
from what they were taught,\
14:48\
or who were wrestling with\
God for forgiveness,\
14:51\
such as Alma the Younger,\
14:53\
the sons of Mosiah, and Enos. In\
their moments of crisis,\
15:01\
they remembered the words\
of their parents,\
15:06\
words of the doctrine of Jesus Christ.\
Remembering saved them.\
15:13\
Your teaching of that sacred doctrine\
will be remembered.\
15:20\
I bear witness of the sacred work of\
teaching Heavenly Father's children\
15:28\
the simple doctrine of Jesus Christ,\
15:32\
which allows us to be\
spiritually cleansed\
15:36\
and ultimately be welcomed into God's\
presence to live with Him\
15:42\
and His Son in glory forever\
15:46\
in families. In the name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
