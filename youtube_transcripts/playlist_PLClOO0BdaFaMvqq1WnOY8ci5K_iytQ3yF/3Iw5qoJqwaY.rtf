In 2015, in the state of Pernambuco,\
Brazil, 62 members of the\
0:07\
J. Reuben Clark Law Society\
cooperated with\
0:10\
the State Prosecutor's Office\
and investigated\
0:13\
the legal challenges of residents\
in four different nursing homes.\
0:17\
For five hours one Saturday,\
0:20\
these attorneys interviewed over\
200 residents, one by one,\
0:25\
each of whom had been functionally\
forgotten by society.\
0:29\
During their interviews, they discovered\
several crimes that had been\
0:33\
committed against the elderly residents,\
such as abandonment, mistreatment,\
0:39\
and misappropriation of funds.\
0:41\
A key pillar of this law society is\
to care for the poor and in need.\
0:46\
Just two months later, the prosecutors\
successfully filed charges against\
0:52\
the responsible parties.\
Their assistance is\
0:56\
a perfect example of King Benjamin’s\
teaching “that when ye are in\
1:00\
the service of your fellow beings, ye\
are only in the service of your God.”\
1:06\
One resident I personally interviewed\
during the pro bono project was\
1:11\
a kind-hearted 93-year-old woman named\
Lucia. Grateful for our service,\
1:17\
she jokingly exclaimed, “Marry me!”\
1:20\
Surprised, I responded, “Look over there\
at that beautiful young woman.\
1:26\
She is my wife and a state prosecutor.”\
She quickly fired back, “So what?\
1:32\
She is young, pretty, and can\
easily get married again.\
1:40\
All I have is you.” The wonderful\
residents did not have all their\
1:46\
problems solved that day.\
1:48\
They undoubtedly continued to experience\
hardship from time to time,\
1:52\
like the Jaredites in their are boats\
on the challenging journey to\
1:56\
the promised land, “buried in\
the depths of the sea\
2:00\
because of the mountain waves\
which broke upon them.”\
2:04\
But that Saturday, the nursing home\
residents knew that regardless of their\
2:10\
earthly anonymity, they were known\
personally by a loving Heavenly Father,\
2:15\
One who responds to even the\
simplest of prayers.\
2:20\
The Master of masters caused a furious\
wind to blow the Jaredites towards\
2:26\
the promised blessings. Similarly,\
2:29\
we can decide to serve as a humble\
gust of wind in the Lord’s hands.\
2:34\
Just as “the wind did never cease\
to blow” the Jaredites towards\
2:39\
the promised land, we can help others\
progress in their journey to receive\
2:45\
God's blessings. Several years ago,\
when Chris, my dear wife,\
2:49\
and I were interviewed for\
my calling as bishop,\
2:52\
our stake president asked me to\
prayerfully consider names to recommend\
2:57\
as counselors. After hearing\
the names I recommended,\
3:01\
he said I should know a few things\
about one of the brethren.\
3:05\
First, this brother could not read.\
Second, he didn’t have a car\
3:10\
he could use to visit members.\
3:13\
Third, he always, always used\
sunglasses at church.\
3:18\
Despite the president’s honest concerns,\
3:21\
I felt strongly that I should still\
recommend him as my counselor and\
3:26\
the stake president supported.\
3:29\
The Sunday my counselors and I were\
sustained in sacrament meeting,\
3:33\
the surprise on the members’\
faces was evident.\
3:37\
This dear brother slowly made\
his way up to the stand,\
3:42\
where the overhead lights reflected\
brightly across his sunglasses.\
3:47\
As he stood by my side,\
I asked him, “Brother,\
3:51\
do you have problems with your vision?”\
“No,” he said.\
3:56\
“Then why do you use sunglasses\
at church?” I asked my friend.\
4:01\
“The members need to see your eyes\
4:03\
and you must be able to\
see them better too.”\
4:06\
In that moment, he took\
off his sunglasses\
4:09\
and never used them at church again.\
4:12\
This beloved brother served at my\
side until my release as bishop.\
4:18\
Today, he continues to serve faithfully\
in the Church and is\
4:22\
an example of dedication and commitment\
to the Lord Jesus Christ.\
4:27\
And yet, years ago, he was an unknown\
sunglass wearer, sitting\
4:33\
essentially forgotten in\
the pews of the chapel.\
4:37\
I often wonder how many\
faithful brothers\
4:41\
and sisters sit forgotten\
among us today.\
4:44\
Whether we are well known or forgotten,\
4:47\
trials will inevitably come\
to each one of us.\
4:51\
As we turn to the Savior,\
4:53\
He can “consecrate [our] afflictions\
for [our] gain”\
4:56\
and help us respond to our trials in\
4:59\
a way that facilitates our\
spiritual progression.\
5:03\
Whether for nursing home residents,\
a misjudged Church member,\
5:07\
or anyone else, we can be “the wind\
[that] did never cease to blow,”\
5:12\
bringing hope and guiding others\
to the covenant path.\
5:16\
Our beloved prophet, President\
Russell M. Nelson,\
5:19\
made an exciting and inspiring\
invitation to the youth.\
5:22\
Quote: “I reaffirm strongly that\
the Lord has asked every worthy,\
5:27\
able young man to prepare\
for and serve a mission.\
5:31\
For Latter-day Saint young men,\
5:33\
missionary service is a priesthood\
responsibility. ... For you\
5:38\
young and able sisters,\
5:40\
a mission is also a powerful, but\
optional, opportunity.” Close quote.\
5:46\
Every day, thousands of young men\
5:48\
and women answer the Lord’s\
prophetic call by serving\
5:51\
as missionaries. You are brilliant.\
5:54\
And as President Nelson has said,\
5:56\
you can “have more impact on the world\
than any previous generation!”\
6:01\
Of course, that does not mean you will\
be the best version of yourself\
6:06\
the moment you step foot in the\
Missionary Training Center.\
6:09\
Instead, you might feel like Nephi,\
“led by the Spirit,\
6:14\
not knowing beforehand the things\
which [you] should do.\
6:18\
Nevertheless, [you] went forth.”\
6:21\
Perhaps you feel insecure like Jeremiah\
did and want to say, “I cannot speak,\
6:28\
for I am a child.” You might even\
see your personal shortcomings\
6:33\
and want to cry out like Moses did,\
6:35\
“Oh my Lord, I am not eloquent ...\
6:38\
but I am slow of speech,\
and of a slow tongue.”\
6:42\
If any of you beloved and mighty\
young men and women are having\
6:48\
a thought like this right now,\
6:50\
remember that the Lord has answered,\
“Say not, I am a child,\
6:55\
for thou shalt go to all\
that I shall send thee.”\
6:59\
And He promises, “Therefore go, and\
I will be with thy mouth,\
7:04\
and teach thee what thou shalt say.”\
7:06\
Your transformation from your natural to\
your spiritual self will occur line\
7:12\
upon line, precept upon precept\
7:15\
as you earnestly strive to\
serve Jesus Christ in\
7:18\
the mission field through\
daily repentance, faith,\
7:22\
exact obedience, and hard work to “find\
constantly, teach repentance,\
7:27\
and baptize converts.” Though\
you wear a name tag,\
7:31\
sometimes you may feel unrecognized\
or forgotten.\
7:35\
However, you must know that you have\
7:38\
a perfect Heavenly Father who\
knows you personally and\
7:43\
a Savior that loves you. You\
have mission leaders who,\
7:47\
despite their imperfections,\
7:49\
will serve you as the “wind [that]\
did never ceased to blow”\
7:53\
and guide you along your journey\
of personal conversion.\
7:57\
In the “land that floweth with milk\
and honey,” you’ll serve\
8:01\
on your mission, you will be\
spiritually reborn and become\
8:06\
a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ.\
As you draw near to Him,\
8:11\
you can come to know that\
you are never forgotten.\
8:16\
Though some may wait a\
“long time” for relief,\
8:18\
for they “have no man”\
that can yet help,\
8:22\
the Lord Jesus Christ has taught us\
that no one is ever forgotten by Him.\
8:28\
On the contrary, He was a perfect\
example of seeking out\
8:33\
the one in every moment of\
His mortal ministry.\
8:37\
Each of us, and those around us, face\
our own storms of opposition\
8:43\
and waves of trials that\
submerge us daily.\
8:47\
But “the wind [will not] cease to blow\
towards the promised land ...\
8:52\
and thus [we shall be] driven\
forth before the wind.”\
8:56\
Each of us can be a part of this wind—\
8:59\
the same wind that blessed the\
Jaredites in their journey,\
9:03\
and the same wind that, with our help,\
9:05\
will bless the unrecognized\
9:07\
and forgotten to reach their\
own promised lands.\
9:11\
I testify that Jesus Christ is\
our Advocate with the Father.\
9:19\
He is a living God and acts as\
9:22\
a strong wind that will always guide\
us along the covenant path.\
9:28\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
