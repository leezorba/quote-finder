My purpose this day and always is to\
testify of Jesus Christ. That He is\
0:07\
the Son of God, the Creator\
and Savior of the world,\
0:10\
our Deliverer and Redeemer.\
0:14\
Because “the fundamental principles of\
our religion is the testimony of\
0:19\
the apostles and prophets,\
concerning Jesus Christ,”\
0:22\
today I share with you my knowledge\
and testimony of the Savior,\
0:27\
as it has been strengthened\
and deepened by the life\
0:30\
and teachings of one key\
apostle and prophet.\
0:37\
On the morning of a beautiful, clear day\
early in the spring of 1820,\
0:44\
14-year-old Joseph Smith entered\
0:46\
a grove of trees near his family's\
home to pray about his sins\
0:51\
and to ask which church to join.\
0:54\
His sincere prayer, offered\
with unwavering faith,\
0:59\
received the attention of the most\
powerful forces in the universe,\
1:03\
including the Father and\
the Son, and the devil.\
1:09\
Each of these had an intense\
interest in that prayer\
1:14\
and in that boy. What we now call\
the “First Vision” marked\
1:20\
the beginning of the Restoration of all\
things in this last dispensation.\
1:25\
But for Joseph, the experience was\
also personal and preparatory.\
1:32\
All he wanted was forgiveness and\
direction. The Lord gave him both.\
1:38\
The instruction to join none of\
the churches was directive,\
1:43\
and the words “Thy sins are forgiven\
thee” were redemptive. For all\
1:49\
the beautiful truths we might learn\
from that First Vision,\
1:53\
perhaps Joseph’s main takeaway\
was simply, “I had found\
1:57\
the testimony of James to be true—\
2:00\
that a man who lacked wisdom might\
ask of God and obtain.”\
2:06\
As one scholar noted, quote,\
2:08\
“The real resonance of the First Vision\
today is to know that it’s\
2:13\
the nature of God to give to\
those who lack wisdom. ...\
2:17\
The God that reveals himself to Joseph\
Smith in the Sacred Grove is\
2:23\
a God who answers teenagers in times\
of trouble.” Close quote.\
2:30\
Joseph’s experience in the grove gave\
him confidence to ask for forgiveness\
2:35\
and direction for the rest of his life.\
2:39\
His experience has also given me\
confidence to ask for forgiveness\
2:45\
and direction for the rest of my life.\
2:49\
On September 21, 1823, Joseph\
earnestly prayed for forgiveness,\
2:56\
confident that because\
of his experience in\
2:59\
the grove three years earlier, heaven\
would respond again. And it did.\
3:06\
The Lord sent an angel, Moroni,\
3:10\
to instruct Joseph and inform\
him of an ancient record\
3:14\
he would later translate by the gift and\
power of God: the Book of Mormon.\
3:20\
Almost 13 years after that, Joseph and\
Oliver Cowdery knelt in solemn,\
3:26\
silent prayer in the newly dedicated\
Kirtland Temple.\
3:31\
We do not know what they prayed for,\
3:35\
but their prayers likely included\
a plea for forgiveness.\
3:41\
For as they arose the Savior appeared\
and declared, “Behold,\
3:48\
your sins are forgiven you;\
you are clean before me.”\
3:55\
In the months and years\
after this experience,\
3:58\
Joseph and Oliver would\
sin again and again.\
4:04\
But in that moment, for that moment,\
in response to their plea,\
4:10\
and in preparation for the glorious\
restoration of priesthood keys that was\
4:15\
about to happen, Jesus\
made them sinless.\
4:22\
Joseph’s life of regular repentance\
gives me confidence to “come boldly unto\
4:30\
the throne of grace, that\
[I] may obtain mercy.”\
4:34\
I have learned that Jesus Christ truly\
is of a forgiving disposition.\
4:40\
It is neither His mission nor His nature\
to condemn. He came to save.\
4:51\
As part of the promised “restitution\
of all things,” the Lord,\
4:55\
through Joseph Smith, brought\
forth the Book of Mormon\
5:00\
and other revelations that contain\
the fulness of His gospel.\
5:04\
Vital truths were given clarity\
and completeness,\
5:09\
as Joseph repeatedly inquired\
of the Lord for direction.\
5:15\
Consider the following. The Father and\
the Son have bodies as tangible\
5:22\
as man’s. Jesus took upon Himself not\
only our sins, but also our sicknesses,\
5:31\
afflictions, and infirmities.\
5:35\
His Atonement was so excruciating it\
caused Him to bleed from every pore.\
5:45\
We are saved by His grace\
after all we can do.\
5:51\
There are conditions to Christ’s mercy.\
5:57\
As we come unto Christ, He will\
not only forgive our sins,\
6:01\
but He will also change our very nature\
6:04\
so that we have no more disposition\
to do evil.\
6:11\
Christ always commands His\
people to build temples,\
6:14\
where He manifests Himself unto them\
and endows them with power from\
6:20\
on high. I testify that all these\
things are true and necessary.\
6:27\
They represent only a fraction of\
6:30\
the fulness that was restored by Jesus\
Christ through Joseph Smith in response\
6:36\
to Joseph's recurring requests\
for direction.\
6:42\
In 1842, Joseph wrote of amazing things\
that would come to pass in this last\
6:49\
dispensation. He declared that\
during our day, quote,\
6:54\
“The heavenly Priesthood will unite with\
6:57\
the earthly, to bring about\
those great purposes;\
7:01\
and whilst we are thus united in\
one common cause, to roll forth\
7:06\
the kingdom of heaven, the heavenly\
Priesthood are not idle spectators.”\
7:13\
Close quote. In a statement to his\
friend Benjamin Johnson, Joseph said,\
7:19\
“Benjamin, [if I die] I would\
not be far away from you,\
7:25\
and if on the other side of the veil,\
7:27\
I would still be working\
with you and with\
7:30\
the power greatly increased\
to roll on this kingdom.”\
7:37\
On June 27, 1844, Joseph Smith and\
his brother Hyrum were murdered.\
7:47\
Joseph's body was laid to rest,\
7:50\
but his testimony continues to\
reverberate around the world\
7:54\
and in my soul. His words:\
“I had seen a vision.\
8:01\
I knew it, and I knew that God knew it,\
and I could not deny it.”\
8:07\
“I never told you I was perfect;\
8:10\
but there is no error in the revelations\
which I have taught.”\
8:16\
“The fundamental principles of our\
religion is the testimony of\
8:21\
the apostles and prophets,\
concerning Jesus Christ.\
8:24\
That He died, was buried,\
8:26\
and rose again the third day and\
ascended up into heaven.\
8:30\
And all other things are only appendages\
to these which pertain to\
8:36\
our religion.”\
8:40\
What was said of John the Baptist might\
also be said of Joseph Smith.\
8:47\
“There was a man sent from God\
whose name was [Joseph]. ...\
8:55\
He was not that Light, but was sent to\
bear witness of that Light ... that all\
9:01\
men through him, might believe.”\
9:07\
I believe. I believe and am sure\
that Jesus is the Christ,\
9:15\
the Son of the living God.\
9:16\
I testify that the living God\
is our loving Father.\
9:22\
I know this because the voice of\
the Lord has spoken it to me,\
9:27\
and so has the voice of His servants,\
the apostles and prophets,\
9:31\
including and beginning\
with Joseph Smith.\
9:36\
I testify that Joseph Smith was\
and is a prophet of God,\
9:40\
a witness and servant of\
the Lord Jesus Christ.\
9:44\
He was blessed to open the\
last dispensation,\
9:47\
and we are blessed that he did.\
9:51\
The Lord commanded Oliver Cowdery,\
“Stand by my servant Joseph faithfully.”\
9:59\
I testify that the Lord stands\
by His servant Joseph and\
10:05\
the Restoration wrought through him.\
10:10\
Joseph Smith is now part of that\
heavenly priesthood of which he spoke.\
10:17\
As he promised his friend,\
10:19\
he is not far away from us, and\
on the other side of the veil\
10:24\
he is still working with us and with\
a power greatly increased to roll\
10:30\
on this kingdom. With joy\
and thanksgiving,\
10:34\
I raise my voice in praise to the\
man who communed with Jehovah,\
10:41\
and above all, praise to Jehovah,\
who communed with that man.\
10:50\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
