President Nelson, we love you.\
0:03\
My wife, Mary, and I recently saw a\
t-shirt with the picture of a book and\
0:08\
a message on the front which read: “A\
Book: The Original Handheld Device.”\
0:16\
I thought about this\
interesting message\
0:18\
and how significant handheld devices\
of all kinds have become.\
0:24\
Upon further contemplation, I\
realized that any device,\
0:29\
or even one equipped with artificial\
intelligence, will never be\
0:34\
as important or significant as\
0:37\
the spiritual guidance that comes\
from divine revelation.\
0:41\
Whether handheld or digital,\
0:44\
the Holy Bible and the Book of Mormon:\
Another Testament of Jesus Christ\
0:50\
provide spiritual guidance and\
teaching from Jesus Christ,\
0:54\
the Savior of the world.\
We treasure these books\
0:58\
for their profound role in documenting\
God's direction to ancient prophets\
1:04\
and people, and the guidance\
they provide for us\
1:08\
for our own personal lives.\
1:10\
Combined with the teachings\
of living prophets,\
1:14\
these sacred scriptures provide\
doctrinal direction\
1:17\
for us in today's world. These\
scriptures are most powerful when they\
1:23\
give instruction, correction, comfort,\
1:26\
and consolation to individuals and\
families who seek guidance from\
1:30\
the Lord. The scriptures,\
1:33\
combined with spiritual inspiration\
from the Holy Spirit,\
1:37\
continue to be the primary\
source that facilitates\
1:43\
the conversion of those who have broken\
hearts and contrite spirits,\
1:49\
and a desire to follow Jesus Christ.\
1:52\
The scriptures help build a foundation\
that can withstand\
1:56\
the adversary's constant efforts\
to undermine faith.\
2:00\
New converts have blessed and\
been the lifeblood of\
2:04\
the Church throughout its history.\
2:06\
One example is particularly precious\
to me. When I was a young bishop,\
2:12\
two marvelous sister missionaries\
were teaching\
2:14\
the William Edward Mussman family.\
2:17\
The father, a very capable lawyer, was\
general counsel of a major corporation.\
2:23\
His devoted wife, Janet, was helping\
the family strive to live\
2:28\
a more Christlike life.\
2:30\
Their exceptional son and daughter,\
both in their early 20s,\
2:34\
were also being taught. All four\
had received the lessons\
2:39\
and were attending church.\
2:41\
The sister missionaries had emphasized\
reading the Book of Mormon and praying\
2:46\
for a testimony of that\
sacred scripture.\
2:49\
Remarkably, the family prayerfully\
read the entire Book of Mormon in\
2:56\
a short time. The ward missionaries,\
2:59\
both of whom were prior ward\
Relief Society presidents,\
3:02\
accompanied them to sacrament meetings.\
3:05\
As the family was nearing baptism,\
3:08\
they received a barrage of literature\
critical of the Church.\
3:13\
This was before the internet,\
3:15\
but the material filled\
a large cardboard box.\
3:20\
The sister missionaries invited me as\
3:22\
a recently called 34-year-old bishop to\
help answer the questions being raised.\
3:28\
When we gathered in their living room,\
3:30\
the large box of pamphlets critical\
of the Church was in the middle of\
3:35\
the room. I had prayerfully approached\
this assignment.\
3:39\
During the prayer, the Spirit whispered\
to me, “He already knows it is true.”\
3:44\
This was important. The sisters\
believed that the rest of\
3:47\
the family already had a testimony.\
They were unsure about the father.\
3:53\
I immediately informed him that\
the Spirit had prompted me\
3:57\
that he already had a testimony.\
Was that true?\
4:01\
He looked at me intently and said\
that the Spirit had confirmed\
4:05\
the truth of the Book of Mormon\
and the Church to him.\
4:09\
I then asked whether it would\
be necessary to review\
4:12\
the pamphlets if they already had\
a spiritual confirmation.\
4:16\
The father replied that it\
would not be necessary.\
4:20\
The rest of the family concurred\
with his answer.\
4:24\
He said he did have a significant\
question.\
4:27\
One reason they had received\
so much literature opposing\
4:31\
the Church was that they were\
members of another faith.\
4:35\
In addition, he had made a large pledge\
to help build a new chapel\
4:40\
for that faith. He informed me that\
4:42\
the sister missionaries had taught him\
about the importance of tithing,\
4:46\
which he gratefully accepted,\
4:50\
but he wondered if it would\
be wrong to also honor\
4:53\
the pledge he had previously made.\
4:56\
I assured him that payment of the\
pledge would be both honorable\
5:00\
and appropriate. The entire\
family was baptized.\
5:05\
One year later, they were\
sealed as a family in\
5:07\
the California Oakland Temple. I\
was privileged to be present.\
5:12\
The son completed law school, passed\
the California bar exam,\
5:16\
and immediately served a faithful\
mission in Japan.\
5:19\
I have watched over the years as\
5:22\
the succeeding generations have remained\
faithful to the gospel.\
5:26\
I was privileged to officiate\
at the sealing of one of\
5:29\
the granddaughters. The conversions\
that are occurring in our day are\
5:35\
equally remarkable. Last June,\
Coach Andy Reid,\
5:39\
head football coach of the Kansas\
City Chiefs, and I,\
5:42\
along with others representing\
our faith and other faiths,\
5:47\
spoke in a multi-faith event at the\
Riverside Church in New York City.\
5:52\
Coach Reid emphasized second chances\
and responding to invitations\
5:58\
and opportunities, which is what the\
gospel of Jesus Christ is all about.\
6:04\
The next morning, with our wives, Tammy\
Reid and Mary,\
6:07\
we attended the sacrament meeting\
at the Manhattan Second Ward.\
6:11\
It was a spiritual service. There were\
many new converts in the congregation.\
6:17\
Five recently baptized members,\
four men and one young man,\
6:22\
were among the Aaronic Priesthood\
members passing the sacrament.\
6:26\
I'm happy to report that a similar\
influx of new members is happening\
6:32\
throughout the Church.\
We are grateful for\
6:35\
the noticeable increase in those who\
respond to sacred invitations,\
6:40\
change their lives, and accept\
6:42\
the opportunity to follow Jesus\
Christ. They enter\
6:46\
the covenant path through faith,\
repentance, baptism,\
6:49\
and confirmation as taught in the Holy\
Bible and the Book of Mormon.\
6:54\
We cannot underestimate the significance\
of sacred scriptures,\
6:58\
both in conversions and in remaining\
faithful in the gospel.\
7:03\
The ancient prophets described in\
the Book of Mormon knew about\
7:07\
the mission of Jesus Christ\
and taught His gospel.\
7:11\
The Book of Mormon helps us draw closer\
to God as we learn, understand,\
7:15\
and apply its teachings. The Prophet\
Joseph Smith taught,\
7:20\
“A man [or woman] would get nearer\
to God by abiding by\
7:24\
the book’s precepts than\
by any other book.”\
7:27\
To know that the Book of Mormon\
is the word of God,\
7:30\
we need to read, ponder,\
and pray about it,\
7:34\
and then act according to its precepts.\
7:37\
The prophet Moroni promised that\
God would reveal the truth of\
7:41\
the book to us as we pray, with\
a sincere heart, with real intent,\
7:48\
and with faith in Christ.\
7:50\
Studying the Book of Mormon is essential\
for enduring conversion.\
7:55\
As we contemplate the relationship\
between the Bible and\
7:59\
the Book of Mormon as handheld devices,\
8:02\
one might ask a question: How useful\
8:05\
and complementary do you think\
two books would be if the Lord\
8:09\
declared they would be “joined together”\
and “become one in thine hand”?\
8:16\
That is what the Lord declared\
concerning the stick of Judah—\
8:20\
the Bible—and the Stick of Joseph—\
the Book of Mormon.\
8:24\
In many significant respects,\
8:27\
the Book of Mormon provides fundamental\
doctrine that enhances\
8:31\
and builds upon the Bible.\
8:33\
The doctrine of the Atonement of Jesus\
Christ is a profound example.\
8:37\
The Bible provides an accurate account\
of the mortal ministry of Jesus Christ,\
8:44\
including His death and resurrection.\
8:47\
The Book of Mormon is more explicit\
about the Atonement of Jesus Christ,\
8:52\
something prophets explained in\
detail prior to His death.\
8:56\
The heading to Alma chapter 42 reflects\
the doctrinal significance of\
9:01\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It reads:\
9:05\
“Mortality is a probationary time to\
enable man to repent and serve God—\
9:11\
The fall brought temporal and spiritual\
death to all mankind—\
9:15\
Redemption comes through repentance—\
9:19\
God himself atoneth for the\
sins of the world—\
9:23\
Mercy is for those who repent—All\
others are subject to God’s justice—\
9:29\
Mercy cometh because of the Atonement—\
Only the truly penitent are saved.”\
9:36\
End quote. President Russell\
M. Nelson has said,\
9:40\
“I promise that as you prayerfully study\
the Book of Mormon every day,\
9:45\
you will make better decisions—\
every day.”\
9:48\
He also promises that “If you daily\
immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon,\
9:54\
you can be immunized against the\
evils of the day.” End quote.\
9:59\
As I mentioned, I was impressed\
with the concept of\
10:03\
the original handheld device: a book.\
10:06\
However, I recognize the incredible\
significance of the internet in\
10:11\
the world today. One modern handheld\
device can provide\
10:15\
the information that historically\
has filled a major library.\
10:19\
We are grateful to live in\
such a time as this.\
10:24\
I am particularly grateful that\
it allows sacred books\
10:27\
and Church materials to be\
available digitally.\
10:32\
The internet is a powerful tool\
for studying the gospel.\
10:36\
Today, many people share scriptures\
with friends using technology.\
10:41\
The Book of Mormon app, for example,\
10:44\
is a wonderful way to introduce\
friends to the Book of Mormon\
10:48\
and can easily be shared in normal and\
natural ways wherever you may be.\
10:54\
While the internet provides many\
blessings, unfortunately,\
10:58\
like the written pamphlets critical\
of the Church I described earlier,\
11:03\
it has also been used to create doubt\
11:06\
and undermine faith in precious\
gospel principles.\
11:11\
It can be part of the evils of the day\
that President Nelson mentioned.\
11:16\
The adversary and those who assist him\
knowingly or unwittingly have created\
11:22\
on the internet the equivalent of\
11:24\
the box full of written\
material critical of\
11:27\
the Church described earlier, intended\
to draw you away from God’s truth.\
11:33\
The issues raised to create doubt over\
the years have been remarkably similar.\
11:38\
This is especially true when you\
compare our day with the 1960s,\
11:43\
when I was in my 20s. The scriptures\
teach us to use judgment\
11:47\
and be wise in all things.\
11:50\
The internet can be used in a positive\
way or a destructive way.\
11:54\
Both long-term members and those\
newly studying\
11:58\
the gospel need to be intentional\
about what they view.\
12:02\
Do not entertain immoral, dishonest,\
or unrighteous material.\
12:06\
If you do, algorithms can lead you\
down a path that destroys faith\
12:12\
and impairs your eternal progression.\
12:15\
You can be acted upon positively\
or negatively.\
12:18\
Seek righteousness and\
avoid dark internet\
12:22\
rabbit holes and doomscrolling.\
12:25\
Fill your life with positive,\
righteous ideas. Be joyful.\
12:31\
Have fun, but avoid foolishness.\
There is a difference.\
12:37\
The 13th Article of Faith\
is a marvelous guide.\
12:41\
Above all, immerse yourself regularly\
in the Book of Mormon,\
12:45\
which will draw the Spirit\
into your life\
12:48\
and help you discern truth from error.\
12:51\
My counsel for those who have in any way\
deviated from the covenant path\
12:57\
is to return to the sacred scriptures,\
prophetic guidance,\
13:02\
religious observance in the home,\
and the music of faith.\
13:07\
Every soul is precious to the Lord.\
We need you.\
13:12\
The Lord needs you and you need Him.\
You will always be welcome.\
13:18\
During my many years of Church service,\
13:20\
I have cherished the wonderful people\
who returned to the covenant path\
13:25\
and then served and blessed\
everyone they loved\
13:28\
or with whom they came in contact.\
13:30\
The sacred scriptures and living\
prophets are a major way\
13:35\
a loving Heavenly Father makes His plan\
of happiness available to all His\
13:41\
children. I bear my sure witness of\
the divinity of Jesus Christ and\
13:46\
the reality of His Atonement. In the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
