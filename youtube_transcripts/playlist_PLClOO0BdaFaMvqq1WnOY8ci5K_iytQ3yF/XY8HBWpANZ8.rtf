Thank you. Elder Cook. Today, I would\
like to address one of the most joyful,\
0:06\
glorious, and powerful gospel truths\
that God has revealed at\
0:11\
the same time it is ironically, one\
for which we have been criticized.\
0:16\
An experience I had some years ago\
profoundly deepened my appreciation\
0:20\
for this particular truth.\
0:22\
As a representative of the Church,\
0:24\
I was once invited to a religious\
conference when it was announced that\
0:28\
from that moment on, they\
would recognize\
0:30\
as valid all baptisms performed by\
almost all other Christian churches,\
0:35\
as long as the ordinance was done with\
water, and in the name of the Father,\
0:39\
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\
0:42\
Then it was explained that this policy\
did not apply to baptisms performed\
0:46\
by The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
0:49\
After the conference, I was able to\
delve deeper into the reasons for\
0:53\
the exception with a leader in\
charge of the announcement.\
0:56\
We had a wonderful and insightful\
conversation.\
0:59\
In short, he explained to me that\
1:01\
the exception was primarily to do\
with our particular belief about\
1:06\
the Godhead, which other Christian\
denominations often refers to as\
1:09\
the Trinity. I expressed my\
appreciation for him\
1:12\
taking the time to explain to me his\
beliefs and the policies of his church.\
1:18\
At the end of our conversation, we\
hugged and then say goodbye.\
1:22\
As I later contemplated our discussion,\
what this leader said about the\
1:27\
Latter-day Saints not understanding what\
he called the mystery of\
1:29\
the Trinity stayed in my mind.\
What he was referring to—\
1:34\
well, it had to do with our\
understanding of the nature of God.\
1:39\
We believe that God the Father\
“is an exalted man” with\
1:44\
a glorified “body of flesh and bones\
1:46\
as tangible as man’s; [and]\
the Son also.”\
1:51\
Thus, every time we talk about the\
nature of God in some way,\
1:55\
somehow we are also talking\
about our own nature.\
1:59\
And this is true not only because\
we are all made “in [His] image,\
2:03\
after [His] likeness,” but also\
because, as the Psalmist recorded,\
2:08\
God said, “Ye are gods; and all of you\
are the children of the most High.”\
2:14\
This is for us a precious doctrine\
2:16\
now recovered with the advance\
of the Restoration.\
2:19\
In summary, it's nothing more\
2:21\
or less than what our missionaries\
teach every first lesson,\
2:24\
first paragraph, first line:\
2:27\
“God is our Heavenly Father\
[and] we are His children.”\
2:31\
Now you may say, “But many people\
believe we are children of God.”\
2:34\
Yes, that is true, but they understand\
it maybe a little bit different from\
2:38\
the implication of its deeper meaning\
that we affirm. For Latter-day Saints,\
2:44\
this teaching is not metaphorical.\
2:46\
We truly believe that we are literally\
the children of God.\
2:51\
He is the Father of our spirits,\
and because of that,\
2:54\
we have the potential\
to become like Him,\
2:57\
which seems to be inconceivable to some.\
3:00\
It’s now been over 200 years since\
the First Vision opened the doors\
3:04\
for the Restoration. At the time,\
3:07\
young Joseph Smith sought guidance from\
heaven to know what church to join.\
3:13\
Through revelations he received that day\
and later revelations given to him, the\
3:18\
Prophet Joseph obtained knowledge\
about the nature of God\
3:21\
and our relationship with\
Him as His children.\
3:24\
Because of that, we learn more clearly\
that Heavenly Father has taught this\
3:29\
precious doctrine from\
the very beginning.\
3:31\
Allow me to cite at least two accounts\
from the scriptures to illustrate this.\
3:35\
You might remember God's instruction\
to Moses as recorded in\
3:39\
the Pearl of Great Price. We read:\
3:42\
“God spake to Moses, saying, behold,\
I am the Lord ... Almighty,\
3:46\
and Endless is my name.” In other words,\
“Moses, I want you to know who I am.”\
3:52\
And then He added, “And behold,\
thou art my son.”\
3:56\
And later He said, “And I have a\
work for thee, Moses, my son;\
4:00\
and thou art in the similitude\
of mine Only Begotten.”\
4:04\
And then finally ended with, “And now,\
behold, this one thing I show unto thee,\
4:10\
Moses, my son.” It appears that God was\
determined to teach Moses at least\
4:15\
one lesson: “You are my child,” which\
He repeated at least three times.\
4:20\
He could not even mention the name of\
Moses without immediately adding\
4:23\
afterwards that he was His son.\
4:26\
However, after Moses was left alone,\
4:29\
he felt weak because he was no longer\
in the presence of God.\
4:33\
That is when Satan came to tempt him.\
Can we see a pattern here?\
4:37\
The first thing he said was, “Moses\
son of man, worship me.”\
4:42\
In this context, Satan's request to\
worship him may have only been\
4:47\
a distraction. A significant temptation\
4:50\
for Moses in that moment of weakness\
was to become confused\
4:53\
and believe that he was only a son of\
man, rather than a child of God.\
4:58\
“And it came to pass that Moses looked\
upon Satan and said, who art thou?\
5:04\
For behold, I am a Son of God, in the\
similitude of his Only Begotten.”\
5:09\
Fortunately, Moses was not confused and\
did not allow himself to be distracted.\
5:14\
He had learned a lesson\
of who he really was.\
5:18\
The next account is found\
in Matthew 4.\
5:21\
Scholars entitled this “The Three\
Temptations of Jesus,”\
5:25\
as if the Lord has been only\
tempted three times,\
5:27\
which of course is not the case.\
5:30\
Hundreds of gallons of ink has been\
used to explain the meaning\
5:34\
and content of these temptations.\
5:36\
As we know, the chapter begins by\
explaining that Jesus had gone into\
5:40\
the desert, “And when he had fasted\
for 40 days and 40 nights,\
5:45\
he was afterwards an hungered.”\
5:48\
Then Satan's first temptation\
would apparently,\
5:51\
apparently have only to do with\
satisfying the Lord's physical needs.\
5:56\
“Command these stones be made bread,”\
he challenged him. A second\
6:01\
enticement may have to do\
with tempting God:\
6:04\
“Cast thyself down; for it is written,\
he will give his angels charge of thee.”\
6:10\
Finally, Satan’s third temptation\
refers to the aspirations of the\
6:14\
glory of the world. After Jesus had been\
shown “all the kingdoms of the world ...\
6:19\
[Satan] said unto him, all these\
things I will give thee,\
6:23\
if thou will fall down and worship me.”\
6:26\
In truth, Satan's ultimate temptation\
may have less to do with those three\
6:33\
specific provocations, and more to do\
with tempting Jesus Christ to question\
6:38\
His divine nature. At least twice,\
6:41\
the enticement was preceded by\
6:43\
the challenging accusation from Satan\
“if thou be the Son of God.”\
6:48\
If you really believe it,\
then do this or do that.\
6:52\
Please notice what had happened\
immediately before Jesus went into\
6:56\
the desert to fast and pray.\
6:57\
We find the account of Christ’s baptism.\
And when He came out of the water,\
7:02\
then the voice came from heaven, saying,\
“This is my beloved Son,\
7:08\
in whom I am well pleased.”\
Do we see the connection?\
7:12\
Can we recognize the pattern here?\
7:14\
It is no wonder that every time we are\
taught about our divine nature\
7:19\
and destiny, the adversary of all\
righteousness tempts us to call them\
7:24\
into question. How different our life\
7:27\
and decisions would be if we really\
knew who we really are.\
7:32\
We live in a challenging world, a\
world of increasing commotion,\
7:36\
where honorable people strive\
to at least emphasize\
7:41\
a divine human dignity, while we\
belong to a Church and embrace\
7:46\
a gospel that lifts our vision and\
invites us into the divine.\
7:51\
Jesus’s commandment to be “perfect, even\
as [our] Father which is in heaven,\
7:55\
is perfect” is a clear reflection\
of His expectations\
7:59\
and eternal possibilities. And none\
of this will happen overnight.\
8:03\
In the words of President Jeffrey R.\
Holland, it will happen “eventually.”\
8:07\
But the promise is that if we come unto\
Christ, we will be perfected in Him.\
8:13\
That requires a lot of work. Not just\
any work, a divine work, His work. Now,\
8:19\
the good news is that it is precisely\
our Heavenly Father who has said,\
8:23\
“For behold, this is my work and my\
glory—to bring to pass the immortality\
8:29\
and eternal life of man.” President\
Nelson’s invitation to think celestial\
8:34\
implies a wonderful reminder of\
our divine nature, origin,\
8:39\
and potential destination.\
8:41\
We can only obtain the celestial through\
Jesus Christ’s atoning sacrifice.\
8:46\
Perhaps that is why Satan\
enticed Jesus with\
8:51\
the very same temptation\
from the beginning to\
8:54\
the end of His earthly ministry.\
8:56\
Matthew recorded that while\
Jesus hung on the cross, those\
8:59\
“that passed by reviled him, ... saying,\
... if thou be the Son of God,\
9:06\
come down the cross.” Glory be to God,\
that He did not hearken,\
9:11\
but instead provided the way for us to\
receive all celestial blessings.\
9:16\
Let us always remember there was a great\
price paid for our happiness.\
9:22\
I testify, as with the Apostle Paul,\
9:25\
that “The Spirit itself beareth\
witness with our spirit,\
9:28\
that we are the children of God:\
9:30\
And if children, then heirs; heirs of\
God, and joint heirs with Christ;\
9:35\
if so be that we suffer with him, that\
we may be also glorified together.”\
9:40\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
