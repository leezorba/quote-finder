My dear brothers and sisters\
across the world,\
0:05\
as we begin this very special\
time of general conference,\
0:09\
the eyes of heaven will certainly\
be focused upon us.\
0:13\
We will hear the voice of the\
Lord through His servants.\
0:16\
We will feel the “guiding, directing,\
0:19\
and comforting” influence\
of the Holy Ghost,\
0:21\
and our faith will be strengthened.\
0:24\
Three years ago, President Russell M.\
Nelson began general conference with\
0:29\
these words: “Pure revelation for\
0:32\
the questions in your heart will\
make this conference rewarding\
0:37\
and unforgettable. If you have not\
yet sought for the ministering of\
0:41\
the Holy Ghost to help you to hear what\
0:44\
the Lord would have you hear\
during these two days,\
0:48\
I invite you to do so now.\
0:51\
Please make this conference a time\
of feasting on messages from\
0:56\
the Lord through His servants.”\
1:01\
The scriptures link three words\
powerfully together: faith, hope,\
1:07\
charity. The gift of hope is a\
priceless endowment from God.\
1:14\
The word “hope” is used in many\
things we want to happen.\
1:18\
For example, “I hope it won’t rain,”\
or, “I hope our team wins.”\
1:25\
My intent is to speak of our\
sacred and eternal hopes\
1:30\
centered in Jesus Christ and\
the restored gospel,\
1:34\
and our “confident expectations of the\
promised blessings of righteousness.”\
1:41\
Our hope of eternal life is assured\
through the grace of Christ\
1:46\
and our own choices, allowing us\
1:49\
the remarkable blessing of returning\
to our heavenly home\
1:53\
and living forever in peace and\
happiness with our Heavenly Father,\
1:58\
His Beloved Son, our faithful\
family and precious friends,\
2:03\
and the righteous men and women from\
every continent and every century.\
2:10\
On earth, we experience joy and sorrow\
as we are tested and proven.\
2:17\
Our victory comes through faith in Jesus\
Christ as we triumph over our\
2:23\
sins, difficulties, temptations,\
unfairness,\
2:27\
and the challenges of this mortal life.\
We are strengthened\
2:34\
As we strengthen our faith\
in Jesus Christ,\
2:37\
we see beyond our struggles to the\
blessings and promises of eternity.\
2:43\
Like a light whose brilliance grows,\
2:46\
hope brightens the darkened world,\
and we see our glorious future.\
2:53\
Since the beginning, our Heavenly Father\
and His Beloved Son have eagerly\
2:58\
blessed the righteous with the\
precious gift of hope.\
3:03\
The power of the Lord's Spirit\
enlightens the faithful today,\
3:08\
illuminating the reality\
of eternal life.\
3:12\
The Savior sends us a Comforter,\
the Holy Ghost, a companion\
3:18\
bringing faith, hope, and peace, “not\
as the world giveth.” “In the world,”\
3:25\
the Savior said, “ye shall have\
tribulation: but be of good cheer\
3:30\
[keep a brightness of hope]; I\
have overcome the world.”\
3:35\
In times of difficulty, we choose\
to trust the Lord in faith.\
3:41\
We quietly pray, “Not my will,\
but thine be done.”\
3:47\
We feel the Lord's approval\
for our meek willingness,\
3:51\
and we await the promised peace the\
Lord will send in His chosen timing.\
3:59\
The Apostle Paul taught: “The God of\
hope [will] fill you with joy and peace,\
4:07\
that ye may abound in hope, [’Rejoicing\
in hope; patient in tribulation,’]\
4:13\
through the power of the Holy Ghost.”\
4:17\
The Prophet Moroni knew firsthand\
about having hope in Christ during\
4:23\
tribulation. He explained his harrowing\
situation: “I am alone.\
4:29\
I have not whither to go.”\
4:31\
“I make not myself known lest\
they should destroy me.”\
4:36\
Remarkably, in this dark\
and lonely hour,\
4:41\
Moroni records his father’s words\
of hope. “If a man have faith\
4:48\
he must needs have hope.” “What is\
it that ye shall hope for?\
4:53\
Ye shall have hope through the\
atonement of Christ and\
4:57\
the power of his resurrection, to\
be raised unto life eternal.”\
5:04\
My brothers and sisters,\
hope is a living gift,\
5:10\
a gift that grows as we increase\
our faith in Jesus Christ.\
5:14\
“Faith is the [substance]\
of things hoped for.”\
5:18\
We build this substance, the evidence\
blocks of our faith through prayer,\
5:24\
temple covenants, keeping\
the commandments,\
5:27\
continually feasting on the scriptures\
and the words of modern-day prophets,\
5:32\
taking the sacrament, serving others,\
5:35\
and worshiping weekly with\
our fellow saints.\
5:41\
To fortify our hope in a time\
of increasing wickedness,\
5:45\
the Lord has directed His prophet to\
dot the earth with His temples.\
5:50\
As we enter the Lord’s house, we feel\
the Spirit of God verifying our hope.\
5:57\
The temple testifies of the empty tomb\
and that life beyond the veil continues\
6:03\
for all. For those who do not\
have an eternal companion,\
6:09\
the ordinances powerfully confirm that\
every righteous person will receive\
6:16\
every promised blessing. There\
is sublime hope as\
6:22\
a young couple kneels across the altar\
to be sealed, not just for time\
6:27\
but for eternity. There is an\
immensity of hope for us in\
6:33\
the promises made to our posterity,\
whatever their current circumstances.\
6:39\
There is no pain, no sickness,\
no injustice, no suffering,\
6:44\
nothing that can darken\
our hope as we believe\
6:49\
and hold tightly to our covenants with\
God in the house of the Lord.\
6:54\
It is a house of light, a house of hope.\
7:01\
We shed tears of sorrow\
as we see the sadness\
7:04\
and despair in those who\
have no hope in Christ.\
7:09\
I recently observed from a distance\
7:12\
a couple who at one time\
had faith in Christ,\
7:15\
but then decided to discard\
their belief.\
7:19\
They were successful in the world,\
7:22\
and they found pleasure\
in their intellect and\
7:25\
the rejection of their faith.\
7:27\
All seemed well until the husband,\
still young and energetic,\
7:33\
suddenly fell ill and died.\
7:37\
Like an eclipse of the sun, they had\
blocked the light of the Son,\
7:43\
and the result was an eclipse of hope.\
7:47\
The wife, in her disbelief, now felt\
disoriented, painfully unprepared,\
7:54\
unable to comfort her children.\
7:57\
Her intellect had told her that her\
life was in perfect order until\
8:02\
suddenly she could see no tomorrow. Her\
despair brought darkness and confusion.\
8:11\
Let me contrast her painful despair with\
another family's hope in Christ\
8:18\
during a heartbreaking\
time. Twenty-one years ago,\
8:23\
the newborn son of my nephew, Ben\
Andersen, and his wife, Robbie,\
8:28\
was life-flighted from their Idaho\
farming community to Salt Lake City.\
8:34\
I arrived at the hospital and\
Ben explained the severe,\
8:38\
life-threatening complications\
with their baby’s heart.\
8:42\
We placed our hands on Trey's tiny head.\
8:47\
The Lord blessed him with\
continued life.\
8:52\
Trey had heart surgery the\
first week of his life\
8:56\
and more surgeries followed.\
9:00\
As the years passed, it became apparent\
that Trey would need a heart transplant.\
9:06\
Although his physical activities were\
limited, his faith expanded.\
9:12\
He wrote: “I have never felt sorry for\
myself because I have always known\
9:19\
the importance of having faith in\
Jesus Christ and a testimony of\
9:24\
the plan of salvation.” Trey\
kept on his phone\
9:29\
this well-known quote from\
President Nelson:\
9:33\
“The joy we feel has little to do with\
the circumstances of our lives\
9:38\
and everything to do with the focus\
of our lives.” Trey wrote:\
9:47\
“I’ve always looked forward to\
serving a full-time mission,\
9:50\
but my doctors won’t let me serve\
a mission until at least\
9:55\
a year after my transplant. I’ve\
put my faith in Jesus Christ.”\
10:04\
Trey was excited at being accepted into\
10:06\
the accounting major at BYU\
beginning this semester,\
10:11\
but even more excited in late\
July when he received\
10:16\
the very anticipated telephone\
call to come to the hospital\
10:20\
for his heart transplant. “One year,”\
10:24\
Trey said, “and I will be\
on my mission.”\
10:30\
There were great expectations as\
he entered the operating room.\
10:37\
However, during the surgery there were\
devastating complications And Trey\
10:46\
never regained consciousness.\
10:50\
His mother, Robbie, said, “Friday had\
been the most heartbreaking day,\
10:56\
just trying to wrap our minds around it.\
10:59\
I had stayed up late just trying\
to process everything.\
11:04\
But Saturday, I woke up with a feeling\
of absolute joy. It wasn’t just peace;\
11:12\
it wasn’t denial. I felt joy for my son,\
and I felt joy as his mother.\
11:21\
Ben had gotten up a lot\
earlier than me\
11:24\
and when we finally got\
a chance to talk,\
11:27\
Ben had awakened with the exact\
same feeling.” Ben explained:\
11:35\
“Clarity came to my soul as God taught\
me through His Holy Spirit.\
11:40\
I awoke at 4:00 a.m. and was filled with\
indescribable peace and joy.\
11:47\
How is this possible? The passing of\
Trey is so very painful, and I miss him\
11:54\
so much. But the Lord does\
not leave us comfortless.\
11:58\
I look forward to a joyful reunion.”\
12:04\
Trey had noted in his journal\
these words from\
12:08\
President Nelson’s General\
Conference talk:\
12:11\
“It doesn’t seem possible to feel joy\
when your child suffers with\
12:16\
an incurable illness or\
when you lose your job\
12:20\
or when your spouse betrays you.\
12:22\
Yet that is precisely the\
joy the Savior offers.\
12:27\
His joy is constant, assuring us that\
our ’afflictions shall be but\
12:33\
a small moment’ and be consecrated\
to our gain.”\
12:40\
Brothers and sisters, the peace you\
seek may not come as quickly\
12:45\
as you desire, but I promise you\
that as you trust in the Lord,\
12:51\
His peace will come. May we nurture\
our precious faith,\
12:57\
pressing forward with a perfect\
brightness of hope.\
13:01\
I testify that our hope is\
our Savior Jesus Christ.\
13:05\
He is the God of hope, the Triumph of\
Hope. He lives and He loves you.\
13:13\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
