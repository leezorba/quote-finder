I testify of a loving\
Heavenly Father. In\
0:03\
the April 2019 general conference\
moments after being sustained in\
0:09\
a new responsibility as a\
General Authority Seventy, the\
0:12\
choir sang a rendition of “I Stand All\
Amazed” that pierced my heart and soul.\
0:18\
“I marvel that he would descend from his\
throne divine to rescue a soul\
0:23\
so ... proud as mine, that he should\
extend his great love unto such as I,\
0:28\
sufficient to own, to redeem,\
and to justify.”\
0:31\
As I heard those words,\
I was all amazed.\
0:34\
I felt that despite my\
inadequacies and flaws,\
0:39\
the Lord blessed me to know that in\
His strength I can do all things.\
0:44\
The common feeling of inadequacy,\
weakness,\
0:47\
or even unworthiness is something\
with which many of us struggle.\
0:53\
I still struggle with this. I felt\
it the day I was called.\
0:56\
I have felt it many times, and I still\
feel it right now speaking to you.\
1:01\
However, I have learned that I am\
not alone with these feelings.\
1:05\
In fact, there are many accounts in\
1:07\
the scriptures of those who have seemed\
to have felt similar feelings.\
1:12\
For example, we remember Nephi as a\
faithful and valiant servant of\
1:16\
the Lord. At times even he struggled\
with feelings of unworthiness,\
1:21\
weakness, and inadequacy.\
1:23\
He said, “Notwithstanding the great\
goodness of the Lord in showing me\
1:29\
his great and marvelous works, my heart\
exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am!\
1:35\
Yea, my heart sorroweth\
because of my flesh;\
1:39\
my soul grieveth because\
of my iniquities.”\
1:42\
The Prophet Joseph Smith spoke of often\
feeling condemned in his youth\
1:47\
for his weakness and imperfections.\
1:49\
But Joseph’s feelings of inadequacy\
1:52\
and worry were part of what led him\
to ponder, study, learn, and pray.\
1:58\
As you may remember, he went to pray in\
the grove near his home to find truth,\
2:04\
peace, and forgiveness. He heard\
the Lord say, “Joseph, my son,\
2:09\
thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way,\
2:13\
walk in my statutes, and\
keep my commandments.\
2:17\
Behold, I am the Lord of glory.\
2:20\
I was crucified for the world\
2:22\
that all those who believe in my\
name may have eternal life.”\
2:28\
Joseph's sincere desire to repent and\
seek the salvation of his soul,\
2:33\
helped him to come to Jesus Christ and\
receive forgiveness of his sins.\
2:37\
The continuous effort opened the door\
to the continuing Restoration of\
2:43\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
2:45\
This remarkable experience of\
2:47\
the Prophet Joseph Smith illustrates\
how feeling of weaknesses\
2:52\
and inadequacy can help us recognize\
our fallen nature.\
2:57\
If we are humble, this will help us come\
to recognize our dependance upon\
3:03\
Jesus Christ and stir within our heart a\
sincere desire to turn to the Savior\
3:08\
and repent of our sins. My friends,\
repentance is joy! Sweet\
3:14\
repentance is part of a daily process\
through which line upon line,\
3:19\
precept upon precept the Lord teaches us\
to live a life centered in His teaching.\
3:24\
Like Joseph and Nephi, we can “cry unto\
[God] for mercy; for He is mighty to\
3:31\
save.” He can fulfill any righteous\
desire and longing\
3:35\
and can heal any wound in our lives.\
3:38\
In the Book of Mormon: Another\
Testament of Jesus Christ,\
3:41\
you and I can find countless accounts\
of individuals who learned how to come\
3:45\
unto Christ through sincere repentance.\
3:48\
I'd like to share with you an example of\
a tender mercy of the Lord through\
3:53\
an experience that occurred in my\
beloved island of Puerto Rico.\
3:57\
It was in my hometown of Ponce that a\
sister in the Church, Celia Ayala,\
4:03\
decided that she was going to give\
a Book of Mormon to a friend.\
4:09\
She wrapped it and went to deliver\
4:12\
the gift more precious to her\
than diamonds and rubies,\
4:15\
she said. On her way a\
thief approached her,\
4:20\
grabbed her, and grabbed her\
purse, and ran away with\
4:24\
the special gift inside.\
4:26\
When she told the story at church,\
her friend said, “Who knows,\
4:30\
maybe this was your opportunity\
to share the gospel.”\
4:34\
Well, a few days later, you know what\
happened? Celia received a letter.\
4:39\
I hold that letter that Celia shared\
with me in my hand today,\
4:43\
and it says the same, “Miss Cruz,\
forgive me, forgive me.\
4:48\
You will never know how sorry\
I am for attacking you.\
4:52\
But because of it, my life has changed\
and will continue to change.\
4:57\
[The Book of Mormon] has\
helped me in my life.\
5:00\
The dream of that man of\
God has shaken me.\
5:03\
I am returning your five dollars,\
for I cannot spend them.\
5:07\
I want you to know that you seemed\
to have a radiance about you.\
5:12\
That light seemed to stop me [from\
harming you], so I ran away instead.\
5:17\
I want you to know that\
you will see me again.\
5:21\
But when you do, you won’t recognize me,\
for I will be your brother. ...\
5:27\
Here, where I live, I have to\
find the Lord and go to\
5:31\
the church you belong to.\
5:32\
The message you wrote in that book\
brought tears to my eyes.\
5:38\
Since Wednesday night, I have not\
been able to stop reading it.\
5:42\
I have prayed and asked God to forgive\
me. And I ask you to forgive me.\
5:47\
I thought your wrapped gift was\
something I could sell.\
5:51\
Instead, it has made me want to change\
my life. Forgive me, forgive me.\
5:58\
I beg you. Your friend.”\
Brothers and sisters,\
6:03\
the light of the Savior can reach us\
all, no matter our circumstances.\
6:07\
“It is not possible for you\
to sink lower than\
6:11\
the infinite light of Christ’s\
atonement shines,”\
6:14\
says President Jeffrey R. Holland. As of\
6:17\
the unintended recipient of Celia’s\
gift, the Book of Mormon,\
6:22\
the brother went to witness\
more of the Lord’s mercy.\
6:27\
Although it took time for\
him to forgive himself,\
6:32\
he found joy in repentance.\
What a miracle!\
6:37\
One faithful sister, one Book of Mormon,\
6:41\
sincere repentance, and the Savior’s\
power led to the enjoyment\
6:46\
of the blessings\
of the fulness of the gospel\
6:50\
and sacred covenants in\
the house of the Lord.\
6:53\
Other family members followed and\
accepted sacred responsibility in\
6:58\
the Lord’s vineyard, including\
full-time missionary service.\
7:02\
As we come unto Jesus Christ in\
our path of sincere repentance\
7:09\
will eventually lead us to\
the Savior’s holy temple.\
7:13\
What a righteous motive\
to strive to be clean,\
7:16\
to be worthy of the fulness of\
7:18\
the blessings made possible by our\
Heavenly Father and His Son through\
7:23\
sacred temple covenants. Serving\
regularly in the house of the Lord,\
7:27\
striving to keep the sacred\
covenants we make\
7:30\
there, will increase both our desire\
and our ability to experience\
7:34\
the change of heart, might, mind,\
7:37\
and soul necessary for us to become\
more like our Savior.\
7:41\
President Russell M. Nelson has\
testified, “Nothing will open\
7:46\
the heavens more [than worshiping\
in the temple]. Nothing.”\
7:50\
My dear friends, do you feel\
inadequate? Do you feel unworthy?\
7:56\
Are you second guessing yourself?\
7:58\
Perhaps you might worry and ask, “Do I\
measure up? Is it too late for me?\
8:03\
Why do I keep failing when I’m\
trying my absolute best?”\
8:08\
Well, brothers and sisters,\
8:10\
surely we will make mistakes\
in our lives along the way.\
8:14\
But please remember that as Elder Gerrit\
W. Gong has taught, “Our Savior’s\
8:20\
Atonement is infinite and eternal. Each\
of us strays and falls short.\
8:27\
We may for a time lose our way.\
8:30\
God lovingly assures us [that] no matter\
where we are or what we have done,\
8:37\
there is no point of no return.\
He waits, ready to embrace us.”\
8:43\
As my dear Cari Lu has also taught me,\
8:46\
we need to repent, rewind, and reset\
the time to 0:00 every single day.\
8:53\
Obstacles will come. Let us not wait\
8:56\
for things to get hard before\
turning to God.\
8:59\
Let us not wait until the end of our\
mortal life to truly repent.\
9:03\
Instead, let us now, no matter which\
part of the covenant path we're on,\
9:09\
focus on the redemptive power of Jesus\
Christ and on Heavenly Father's desire\
9:16\
for us to return. The Lord’s house,\
9:19\
His holy scriptures, His holy prophets\
9:22\
and apostles inspire us to strive\
to our personal holiness through\
9:27\
the doctrine of Christ. And Nephi said,\
“And now, my beloved brethren,\
9:32\
this is the way, and there is no other\
way nor name given under heaven,\
9:37\
whereby men and women can be saved\
in the kingdom of God.\
9:42\
And now this is the doctrine of Christ,\
9:45\
and the only true doctrine of\
the Father, and of the Son,\
9:48\
and of the Holy Ghost.” Our process\
of “At-One-Ment” with God may feel\
9:54\
challenging, but you and\
I can pause, be still,\
9:59\
look to the Savior and\
seek to find and\
10:03\
act out how will have us change.\
10:05\
If we do so with full intent,\
10:08\
we will witness His healing and think\
how our posterity will be blessed\
10:13\
as we embrace the Lord's\
gift of repentance.\
10:16\
The Master Potter, taught my dad,\
will mold and refine us,\
10:22\
which can be difficult. Nonetheless, the\
Master Healer will also cleanse us.\
10:28\
I have experienced and continue\
to experience that power.\
10:31\
I testify it comes through faith in\
Jesus Christ and daily repentance.\
10:36\
“Oh, it is wonderful that he should\
care for me enough to die for me.”\
10:41\
I testify of God and of His infinite\
power, His Son’s Atonement.\
10:47\
We can fully and profoundly\
sincerely and wholeheartedly repent.\
10:54\
My friends, I am a witness of\
the glorious Restoration of\
10:59\
the gospel to the Prophet Joseph Smith\
and the current divine guidance of\
11:03\
the Savior to His prophet\
and mouthpiece,\
11:06\
President Russell M. Nelson.\
11:08\
I know Jesus Christ lives and that He\
is the Master Healer of our soul.\
11:13\
I know, and I testify these\
things are true\
11:16\
in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
