For centuries, black powder was the\
most powerful explosive available.\
0:05\
It could launch cannon balls,\
0:08\
but it wasn't effective for most mining\
and road construction projects.\
0:12\
It was just too weak to shatter rock.\
0:16\
In 1846, an Italian chemist named\
Ascanio Sobrero synthesized\
0:22\
a new explosive, nitroglycerin.\
0:25\
This oily fluid was at least\
0:27\
a thousand times more powerful\
than black powder.\
0:31\
It could easily shatter rock.\
0:34\
Unfortunately, nitroglycerin\
was unstable.\
0:38\
If you dropped it from a small height,\
it would blow up.\
0:42\
If it got too hot, it would blow up. If\
it got too cold, it would blow up.\
0:48\
Even placed in a cool dark room\
and left alone, it would\
0:53\
eventually blow up. Most countries\
banned its transportation,\
0:58\
and many banned its manufacture.\
1:01\
In 1860, a Swedish scientist named\
Alfred Nobel began trying to stabilize\
1:08\
nitroglycerin. After seven\
years of experimentation,\
1:12\
he achieved his goal by absorbing\
nitroglycerin into\
1:17\
a nearly worthless substance known as\
diatomaceous earth or kieselguhr.\
1:25\
Kieselguhr is a porous rock\
that can be crumbled into\
1:29\
a fine powder. When mixed\
with nitroglycerin,\
1:34\
kieselguhr absorbs the nitroglycerin,\
1:37\
and the resultant paste can\
be shaped into “sticks.”\
1:42\
In this form, nitroglycerin\
was much more stable.\
1:46\
It could be safely stored, transported,\
1:48\
and used with undiminished\
explosive power.\
1:52\
Nobel named the combination of\
nitroglycerin and kieselguhr dynamite.\
1:59\
Dynamite changed the world. It\
also made Nobel wealthy.\
2:05\
Without a stabilizer, nitroglycerin was\
just too hazardous to be commercially\
2:11\
valuable. As Ascanio Sobrero found\
out by itself, as I mentioned,\
2:18\
kieselguhr was of little value.\
2:22\
But the combination of the two\
components made dynamite transformative\
2:28\
and precious. In a similar way,\
2:32\
the combination of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ and The Church of Jesus Christ\
2:39\
of Latter-day Saints provides powerful\
and transformative benefits for us.\
2:45\
The gospel is perfect, but\
2:48\
a divinely commissioned church\
is required to preach it,\
2:51\
maintain its purity, and administer\
its sacred ordinances with\
2:56\
the Savior's power and authority.\
2:59\
Consider the combination of\
3:00\
the Savior’s gospel and His\
Church as established by\
3:04\
the Book of Mormon prophet Alma.\
3:07\
The Church was responsible\
for preaching “nothing\
3:10\
save it were repentance\
and faith on the Lord,\
3:13\
who [would redeem] his people.”\
Using God’s authority,\
3:17\
the Church was responsible\
for administering\
3:19\
the ordinance of baptism “in\
the name of the Lord,\
3:22\
as a witness [of entering] into a\
covenant with him [to] serve him\
3:26\
and keep his commandments.”\
3:29\
The people who were baptized took upon\
themselves the name of Jesus Christ,\
3:34\
joined His Church, and were promised\
great power through an outpouring of\
3:39\
the Spirit. People flocked to\
3:42\
the waters of Mormon to hear\
Alma preach the gospel.\
3:46\
Though they revered those waters\
and the surrounding forests,\
3:50\
the Lord’s Church was not a location\
or a building; nor is it today.\
3:58\
The Church is simply ordinary people,\
4:01\
disciples of Jesus Christ, gathered\
and organized into\
4:06\
a divinely appointed structure that\
helps the Lord accomplish His purposes.\
4:12\
The Church is the instrument\
through which we learn\
4:15\
the central role of Jesus Christ\
in Heavenly Father's plan.\
4:19\
The Church offers the authoritative way\
4:22\
for individuals to participate\
in ordinances\
4:25\
and make lasting covenants with God.\
4:28\
Keeping those covenants draws\
us closer to God,\
4:32\
gives us access to His power,\
4:35\
and transforms us into who\
He intends us to become.\
4:41\
Just as dynamite without nitroglycerin\
is unremarkable,\
4:46\
the Savior’s Church is special only\
if it’s built on His gospel.\
4:53\
Without the Savior's gospel and\
the authority to administer\
4:56\
the ordinances thereof, the\
Church isn’t exceptional.\
5:02\
Without the stabilizing\
effect of kieselguhr,\
5:05\
nitroglycerin had limited\
value as an explosive.\
5:10\
As history has shown, without\
the Lord’s Church,\
5:15\
humanity’s understanding of His\
gospel was likewise unstable—\
5:20\
prone to doctrinal drift and subject to\
the influence of different religions,\
5:26\
cultures, and philosophies.\
5:29\
An amalgamation of those influences has\
been manifested in every dispensation\
5:34\
leading up to this last one.\
5:37\
Though the gospel was initially\
revealed in its purity,\
5:41\
the interpretation and application\
of that gospel gradually took on\
5:46\
a form of godliness that lacked power\
5:49\
because the divinely authorized\
framework was absent.\
5:54\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
Saints enables access to God’s\
6:00\
power because it’s authorized by Him\
both to teach the doctrine of Christ\
6:05\
and to offer the gospel’s saving\
and exalting ordinances.\
6:10\
The Savior yearns to forgive our sins,\
help us access His power,\
6:15\
and transform us. He suffered for our\
sins and longs to pardon us from\
6:22\
the punishment that we otherwise\
would deserve.\
6:25\
He wants us to become holy\
and be perfected in Him.\
6:30\
Jesus Christ has the power to do this.\
6:34\
He didn't simply sympathize\
with our imperfections\
6:37\
and lament our eternal condemnation\
in consequence of sin.\
6:41\
No, He went beyond that,\
infinitely beyond that,\
6:46\
and restored His Church to enable\
access to His power.\
6:52\
The core of the gospel that\
6:54\
the Church teaches is\
that Jesus Christ\
6:57\
bore “our griefs and\
carried our sorrows.”\
7:01\
He had “laid on him the\
iniquity of us all.”\
7:04\
He “endured the cross,” broke the bands\
of death, “ascended into heaven,\
7:10\
and sat down on the right\
hand of God, to claim of\
7:13\
the Father his rights of mercy.”\
7:16\
The Savior did all this because He\
loves His father and He loves us.\
7:22\
He’s already paid the infinite price.\
7:24\
So He can “claim all those\
who have faith\
7:27\
in him [and] advocate for them—\
7:30\
for us. Jesus Christ wants nothing\
more than for us to repent\
7:36\
and come unto Him, so that He can\
justify and sanctify us. In this desire,\
7:43\
He is relentless and unwavering.\
7:47\
The access to God's covenantal power\
7:51\
and His covenantal love\
is through His Church.\
7:56\
The combination of the Savior’s gospel\
and His Church transforms our lives.\
8:02\
It transformed my maternal grandparents.\
8:06\
My grandfather, Oskar Andersson,\
8:08\
worked in a shipyard on Högmarsö,\
an island in the Stockholm archipelago.\
8:14\
His wife, Albertina, and their\
children lived on\
8:18\
the Swedish mainland. Once every\
two weeks, on Saturday,\
8:22\
Oskar rowed his boat home for\
8:25\
the weekend before returning to\
Högmarsö on Sunday evening.\
8:31\
One day, while in Högmarsö,\
8:33\
he heard two American missionaries\
preach the restored\
8:37\
gospel of Jesus Christ.\
8:40\
Oskar felt that what he\
heard was pure truth\
8:45\
and he was filled with unspeakable joy.\
8:49\
The next time he returned home,\
8:51\
Oskar excitedly told Albertina\
all about the missionaries.\
8:55\
He explained that he believed\
what they taught.\
8:58\
He asked her to read the pamphlets\
they had given him;\
9:01\
and he told her that he didn't think any\
of their future children should be\
9:05\
baptized as infants. Albertina was\
furious and threw the pamphlets on\
9:13\
the rubbish heap. Not much was said\
between them before Oskar returned to\
9:18\
work on Sunday evening. As\
soon as he was gone,\
9:23\
Albertina retrieved those pamphlets.\
9:26\
She carefully compared\
their doctrine with\
9:29\
the teachings in her well-worn Bible.\
9:32\
She was astonished to feel that\
what she read was true.\
9:37\
The next time Oskar returned home,\
he received a warm welcome,\
9:41\
as did the copy of the Book of\
Mormon he brought with him.\
9:45\
Albertina eagerly read, again comparing\
the doctrine to that in her Bible.\
9:52\
Like Oskar, she recognized pure truth\
and was filled with unspeakable joy.\
10:01\
Oskar, Albertina, and their children\
moved to Högmarsö to be close to\
10:06\
the few Church members there.\
10:09\
A week after Oscar and Albertina\
were baptized in 1916,\
10:13\
Oskar was called to be the group\
leader on Högmarsö.\
10:18\
Like many converts, Oskar and\
Albertina faced criticism\
10:22\
because of their new faith.\
10:25\
Local farmers refused to sell them milk,\
10:28\
so Oskar rowed across the fjord every\
day to purchase milk from\
10:32\
a more tolerant farmer. Yet\
during the ensuing years,\
10:38\
Church membership on Högmarsö increased,\
10:42\
in part because of Albertina's powerful\
testimony and burning missionary zeal.\
10:49\
When the group became a branch, Oskar\
was called as the branch president.\
10:55\
Members of that Högmarsö\
branch revered that island.\
11:00\
This was their waters of Mormon.\
11:04\
This was where they came to a\
knowledge of their Redeemer.\
11:10\
Over the years, as they kept\
their baptismal covenant,\
11:14\
Oskar and Albertina were transformed\
by the power of Jesus Christ.\
11:19\
They longed to make more covenants and\
receive their temple blessings.\
11:24\
To obtain those blessings,\
11:26\
they permanently emigrated from their\
11:28\
home in Sweden to\
Salt Lake City in 1949.\
11:31\
Oskar had served as the leader of\
the members on Högmarsö for 33 years.\
11:41\
The combination of nitroglycerin and\
kieselguhr made dynamite valuable;\
11:48\
the combination of the gospel of Jesus\
Christ and His Church is beyond price.\
11:56\
Oskar and Albertina heard about\
the restored gospel\
11:59\
because a prophet of God\
had called, assigned,\
12:02\
and sent missionaries to Sweden.\
By divine commission,\
12:05\
missionaries taught the doctrine of\
Christ and by priesthood authority\
12:09\
baptized Oskar and Albertina.\
As members,\
12:12\
Oskar and Albertina continued learning,\
developing, and serving others.\
12:16\
They became Latter-day Saints\
because they kept\
12:20\
the covenants they made. The Savior\
refers to The Church of Jesus Christ of\
12:26\
Latter-day Saints as “my Church,”\
12:28\
because He commissioned it to accomplish\
His purposes—preaching His\
12:32\
gospel, offering His ordinances\
and covenants,\
12:35\
and making it possible for His power\
to justify and sanctify us.\
12:41\
Without His restored Church today,\
there is no authority,\
12:45\
no preaching of revealed truths in His\
name, no ordinances or covenants,\
12:50\
no manifestation of the\
power of godliness,\
12:53\
no transformation into who\
God wants us to become.\
12:56\
And God’s plan for His children\
is set at naught.\
13:00\
The Church in this dispensation\
is integral to His plan.\
13:04\
I invite you to commit yourself\
more fully to the Savior\
13:08\
and His Gospel and His Church.\
13:10\
As you do so, you’ll find\
that the combination of]\
13:13\
the Savior’s Gospel and His Church\
brings power into your life.\
13:17\
This power is far greater than dynamite.\
13:20\
It will shatter the rocks in your way,\
13:22\
transform you into an inheritor\
in God’s kingdom,\
13:26\
and you will be “filled with that joy\
which is unspeakable and full of glory,”\
13:31\
in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
