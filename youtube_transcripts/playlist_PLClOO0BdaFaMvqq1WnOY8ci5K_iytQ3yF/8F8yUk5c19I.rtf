The Savior taught that when we are\
called unto His everlasting gospel\
0:06\
and covenant with an everlasting\
covenant,\
0:10\
we are counted as the salt of the earth.\
0:13\
Salt is made of two elements bonded\
together. We can’t be salt on our own;\
0:20\
if we are to be salt of the earth,\
we must be bonded to the Lord,\
0:26\
and that is what I see as I mingle with\
members of the Church around the world—\
0:31\
I see faithful members of the\
Church bonded to the Lord,\
0:34\
committed in their efforts\
to serve others,\
0:37\
and being the salt of the earth.\
0:39\
Your unwavering dedication\
is a shining example.\
0:43\
Your service is appreciated\
and cherished.\
0:48\
Our youth have shown remarkable\
courage and devotion.\
0:52\
They have enthusiastically embraced\
the work of family history,\
0:56\
and their frequent visits to\
the house of the Lord are\
0:59\
a testament to their dedication.\
1:02\
Their willingness to devote time and\
energy to serve missions across\
1:07\
the globe reflect a deep\
and abiding faith.\
1:11\
They are not merely participating,\
1:13\
but leading the way in becoming\
disciples bonded to Jesus Christ.\
1:18\
Their service radiates light and hope,\
touching countless lives.\
1:24\
To you, the youth of the Church,\
1:27\
we express our heartfelt thanks\
for your inspiring service.\
1:31\
You’re not just the Church’s future,\
but its present.\
1:35\
And you are indeed the\
salt of the earth!\
1:39\
I love the Lord Jesus Christ\
and feel blessed by\
1:43\
the opportunity to serve alongside\
you in the Lord's Church.\
1:47\
Our unity and strength, grounded\
in our shared faith,\
1:51\
reassures us that we are never\
alone in this journey.\
1:55\
Together, we can continue to build the\
kingdom of God, rooted in service,\
2:01\
love, and unwavering faith.\
2:04\
When Jesus Christ taught\
by the Sea of Galilee,\
2:07\
He often used everyday elements familiar\
to His audience to convey\
2:12\
profound spiritual truths. One\
such element was salt.\
2:16\
Jesus declared, “You are\
the salt of the earth,”\
2:21\
a statement rich in meaning\
and significance,\
2:24\
especially for the people of\
His time who understood\
2:27\
the multifaceted value of salt.\
2:30\
The ancient craft of salt harvesting\
in the Algarve,\
2:34\
the southern region of my home\
country of Portugal,\
2:37\
dates back thousands of years to\
the era of the Roman Empire.\
2:43\
Remarkably, the methods used\
by the salt workers, known\
2:46\
as “Marnotos,” have changed\
little since then.\
2:50\
These dedicated artisans employ\
traditional techniques,\
2:55\
performing their work entirely by hand,\
2:58\
maintaining a legacy that has endured\
through the centuries.\
3:02\
This ancient method harvests what\
is called “Flower of Salt.” To\
3:07\
fully appreciate the intricate process\
of harvesting the Flower of Salt,\
3:12\
it is essential to understand the\
environment in which it is produced.\
3:16\
The Algarve's coastal salt marshes\
provide the ideal conditions\
3:21\
for salt production. Seawater is\
channeled into shallow ponds known\
3:26\
as salt pans, where it is left to\
evaporate under the intense sun.\
3:31\
As the water evaporates, the Flower of\
Salt forms delicate crystals on\
3:36\
the surface of the salt pans.\
3:39\
These crystals are incredibly pure\
and have a unique, crisp texture.\
3:45\
The Marnotos carefully skim\
the crystals from\
3:49\
the water surface using\
specialized tools,\
3:52\
a process that requires great\
skill and precision.\
3:57\
In Portugal, this fine quality salt\
is referred as “salt cream”\
4:02\
because it can be gently skimmed away\
like cream rising to the top of milk.\
4:09\
This delicate salt is cherished for\
its purity and exceptional flavor,\
4:15\
making it a prized ingredient\
in culinary arts.\
4:19\
Just like the Marnotos put forth great\
effort to ensure they harvest\
4:25\
the highest quality of salt,\
so should we,\
4:29\
as the Lord’s covenant people,\
always do our very best\
4:33\
so that our love and example\
are, as much as possible,\
4:38\
a pure reflection of our Savior,\
Jesus Christ.\
4:42\
In the ancient world, salt was\
more than just a seasoning.\
4:46\
It was a vital preservative and a\
symbol of purity and covenant.\
4:51\
People knew that salt was essential\
for preserving food\
4:55\
and enhancing flavor.\
They also understood\
4:58\
the grave implications of salt\
losing its saltiness,\
5:02\
or savor, by becoming contaminated\
or diluted.\
5:06\
Like salt can lose its essence,\
5:09\
we can also lose our spiritual vitality\
if our faith in Jesus Christ becomes\
5:15\
casual. We may look the\
same on the outside,\
5:19\
but without a strong inner faith,\
5:21\
we lose our ability to make a difference\
in the world and bring out\
5:25\
the best in those around us.\
5:28\
So how can we channel our energy and\
efforts to make a difference\
5:33\
and be the change\
the world needs today?\
5:35\
How can we preserve discipleship and\
continue to be a positive influence?\
5:40\
The words of our dear prophet\
still echo in my mind,\
5:44\
and I quote, “God wants us to work\
together and help each other.\
5:49\
That is why He sent us on earth in\
families and organizes us into wards\
5:54\
and stakes. That is why He asks us to\
serve and to minister to each other.\
5:59\
That is why He asks us to live in the\
world but not be of the world.”\
6:05\
When our lives are filled with purpose\
and service, we avoid spiritual apathy.\
6:10\
On the other hand, when our lives\
are deprived of divine purpose,\
6:14\
meaningful service to others,\
6:17\
and sacred opportunities for\
pondering and reflection,\
6:21\
we gradually become suffocated by our\
own activity and self-interest,\
6:27\
risking losing our savor.\
6:29\
The antidote to this is to continue\
to be involved in service,\
6:34\
being anxiously engaged in good works\
and the betterment of ourselves\
6:39\
and the society we live in.\
6:41\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
6:43\
what a blessing we all have\
today to belong to\
6:46\
the Church of Jesus Christ and have the\
opportunity to serve in His Church.\
6:52\
Our circumstances may vary, but\
we all can make a difference.\
6:57\
You remember the Marnotos,\
the salt workers?\
7:01\
They used simple tools to harvest the\
best crystals, the best salt.\
7:06\
We too can do simple things that,\
7:09\
with consistent efforts in small\
and meaningful acts,\
7:13\
can deepen our discipleship and\
commitment to Jesus Christ.\
7:17\
Here are four simple yet profound ways\
we can strive to be the salt of\
7:22\
the earth. Keeping the house of the Lord\
at the center of our devotion.\
7:26\
Now the temples are closer\
than ever before.\
7:30\
Prioritizing regular worship\
in the house of\
7:32\
the Lord will help us focus\
on what matters most\
7:36\
and keeps our lives centered\
in Christ. In the temple,\
7:41\
we find the heart of our faith\
in Jesus Christ and\
7:46\
the soul of our devotion to Him.\
7:49\
Being deliberate in our efforts\
to strengthen others by living\
7:53\
the gospel together. We can strengthen\
our families through consistent\
7:57\
and intentional efforts to bring the\
gospel principles into our lives\
8:02\
and to our homes. Being willing to\
accept a calling and serving in\
8:07\
the Church. Service in our local\
congregations allows us to support one\
8:12\
another and grow together.\
8:14\
While serving is not always convenient,\
it is always rewarding.\
8:20\
And finally, using digital communication\
tools with purpose.\
8:25\
Today, digital communication tools\
allows us to connect as never before.\
8:30\
Like most of you, I use these tools to\
connect with brothers and sisters in\
8:34\
the Church and with my\
family and friends.\
8:38\
As I connect with them,\
I feel closer to them.\
8:41\
We can minister to each other in times\
of need when we cannot be physically\
8:46\
present. These tools are\
undoubtedly a blessing.\
8:50\
Yet these very same tools\
can drag us away from\
8:55\
the depth of meaningful interactions\
8:57\
and eventually cause us to be pulled\
into habits that waste our time in less\
9:03\
purposeful activities. Striving to\
be the salt of the earth includes\
9:09\
so much more than an endless scrolling\
of reels on a six-inch screen.\
9:16\
As we keep the house of the\
Lord central in our lives,\
9:22\
intentionally strengthen others\
by living the gospel,\
9:26\
accepting callings to serve, and using\
digital tools with purpose,\
9:33\
we can preserve our spiritual vitality.\
9:37\
Just as salt in its purest form has\
the power to enhance and preserve,\
9:44\
so too does our faith in Jesus\
Christ when it is nourished\
9:50\
and protected by our dedication to\
Christlike service and love.\
9:57\
As we remain bonded to the Lord,\
9:59\
our lives will naturally reflect\
His light and\
10:04\
we will become the salt of the earth.\
10:07\
In this effort, we not only\
enrich our lives,\
10:11\
but also strengthen our families\
and our communities.\
10:16\
May we strive to maintain this bond with\
the Lord, never lose our savor, and\
10:24\
be the small little crystal of salt\
that the Lord wants us to be.\
10:31\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
