When I was about five years old, I was\
playing football with my friends behind\
0:05\
the church in my small village\
in Cote d'Ivoire.\
0:08\
I vividly remember the preacher's call\
to his congregation to cleanse their\
0:14\
clothes in preparation for\
the Savior's arrival.\
0:19\
I ran home as fast as my little\
legs could carry me,\
0:24\
and begged my mother to clean my few\
clothes so that I could be spotless\
0:29\
and ready for the Savior's\
coming the next day.\
0:33\
Although my mother was skeptical about\
the Savior's imminent return,\
0:37\
she still washed my best outfit.\
0:41\
The next morning, I put on the\
still slightly damp clothing\
0:45\
and eagerly waited for\
the announcement of\
0:48\
the Savior’s arrival. As the day\
wore on and nothing happened,\
0:53\
I decided to go to the meetinghouse.\
0:56\
I was deeply disappointed to\
find the church empty and\
1:00\
the Savior had not arrived.\
1:02\
You can imagine my feelings\
as I slowly walked home.\
1:07\
Years later, as I was receiving\
1:10\
the missionary lessons in preparation to\
join The Church of Jesus Christ of\
1:14\
Latter-day Saints, I read the following:\
1:18\
“And no unclean thing can\
enter into his kingdom;\
1:21\
therefore, nothing entereth in his rest\
1:26\
save it be those who have washed\
their garments in my blood,\
1:30\
because of their faith, and the\
repentance of all their sins,\
1:35\
and their faithfulness unto the end.”\
1:39\
The clarification I received at that\
time helped me to understand\
1:43\
the important truth that had eluded\
my young mind many years prior.\
1:49\
The preacher's message was centered on\
the importance of spiritual purity.\
1:54\
He urged the congregation to seek\
repentance, make changes in their lives,\
2:01\
and turn to the Savior for redemption.\
2:04\
Our Heavenly Father understands\
our mortal journey and\
2:09\
the inevitability of sins in our lives.\
2:12\
I am deeply thankful that He has\
provided a Savior to atone\
2:17\
for our transgressions. Through the\
Savior’s redemptive sacrifice,\
2:22\
each of us can repent and seek\
forgiveness and become clean.\
2:29\
Repentance, a foundational\
principle of the gospel,\
2:33\
is essential for our spiritual\
development and resilience\
2:37\
as we navigate life's challenges.\
2:41\
During the April 2022\
general conference,\
2:44\
President Russell M. Nelson\
invited every member of\
2:48\
the Church to experience the\
joy of daily repentance.\
2:52\
He said, “Please do not fear\
or delay repenting.\
2:57\
Satan delights in your misery.\
Cut it short.\
3:02\
Cast his influence out of your life!\
3:06\
Start today to experience the joy\
of putting off the natural man.\
3:11\
The Savior loves us always, but\
especially when we repent. ...\
3:18\
If you feel you have strayed off the\
covenant path too far or too long\
3:23\
and have no way to return,\
that simply is not true.”\
3:28\
If there is something that you\
have not fully repented of,\
3:32\
I encourage you to heed President\
Nelson's call not to procrastinate your\
3:37\
repentance. It may require some courage\
to engage in this process;\
3:43\
however, I can assure you that\
3:45\
the joy that emanates from genuine\
repentance surpasses understanding.\
3:51\
Through repentance, our burdens of guilt\
are lifted and replaced with\
3:56\
a sense of peace and tranquility.\
As we repent earnestly,\
4:01\
we are sanctified through\
the Savior’s blood,\
4:04\
increasing our sensitivity\
to the promptings and influence of\
4:09\
the Holy Ghost. My eternal companion\
was born with a hearing impairment\
4:15\
and as a result,\
must wear hearing aids.\
4:20\
Dust and sweat can affect the\
performance of these devices.\
4:24\
And so each morning, I observe\
her diligently cleaning\
4:30\
the connecting tube before\
wearing the aids.\
4:33\
This simple yet consistent routine\
eliminates any dirt, moisture,\
4:40\
or condensation, thereby improving\
her ability to hear\
4:45\
and communicate effectively.\
4:47\
When she overlooks this daily ritual,\
4:50\
her ability to hear suffers\
throughout the day;\
4:53\
spoken words gradually fade and\
eventually become inaudible.\
4:59\
Just like a daily hearing aid cleaning\
allows her to hear clearly,\
5:04\
daily repentance allows us to discern\
the guidance of the Lord through\
5:09\
the Holy Ghost. Near the end of\
the Lord's mortal ministry\
5:14\
and before His departure to\
the Garden of Gethsemane,\
5:18\
He prepared His disciples to\
face the upcoming trials.\
5:22\
He assured them, saying, “But the\
Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,\
5:27\
whom the Father will send in my name,\
he shall teach you all things,\
5:33\
and bring all things to your\
remembrance whatsoever\
5:37\
I have said unto you.” One of the Holy\
Ghost’s essential functions is to\
5:44\
caution, lead, and guide every\
individual who listens to the soft inner\
5:48\
voice. Just as the blocked\
communication tubes of\
5:53\
a hearing aid can hinder\
proper functionality,\
5:56\
our spiritual connection with our\
Heavenly Father can also be impaired,\
6:01\
leading to dangerous misconceptions\
or failure to heed His counsel.\
6:07\
The advent of the internet has made\
information more accessible than ever\
6:12\
before. This can lead us\
to turn to the world\
6:16\
for guidance rather than to God.\
6:20\
President Russell M. Nelson\
taught, “In coming days\
6:24\
it will not be possible to survive\
spiritually without the guiding,\
6:29\
directing, comforting, and constant\
influence of the Holy Ghost.”\
6:34\
I am grateful that each of us can\
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost at\
6:40\
the time of our confirmation; however,\
President Dallin H. Oaks\
6:45\
warned that “the blessings available\
through the gift of\
6:49\
the Holy Ghost are conditioned\
upon worthiness”\
6:52\
and “the Spirit of the Lord does\
not dwell in unholy temples.”\
6:59\
When we consciously choose to follow the\
guidance of prophets and apostles,\
7:04\
our capacity to have the Holy Ghost\
as a constant companion grows.\
7:09\
The Holy Ghost provides clarity\
in decision making,\
7:13\
prompting thoughts and impressions that\
align with our Heavenly Father's will.\
7:18\
Having the Holy Ghost as a constant\
companion is crucial\
7:23\
for our spiritual growth.\
7:25\
I was recently assigned to preside\
over a stake conference at\
7:29\
the Salt Lake Granger\
West Stake in Utah.\
7:33\
During this event, I met a stake\
president who had diligently developed\
7:37\
his ability to discern the promptings\
of the Holy Ghost\
7:41\
through righteous living\
and daily repentance.\
7:44\
As part of our ministering efforts, we\
coordinated visits to three households.\
7:50\
Upon completing our final visit,\
7:53\
we found ourselves with approximately\
30 minutes\
7:56\
remaining before our next engagement. As\
we traveled back to the stake center,\
8:02\
President Chesnut received\
8:03\
an impression to visit one\
additional family.\
8:07\
We both agreed to follow this prompting.\
8:10\
We proceeded to visit the Jones family,\
where we discovered Sister Jones\
8:14\
confined to bed due to illness.\
8:18\
It was apparent that she needed\
a priesthood blessing.\
8:21\
With her permission, we\
administered to her.\
8:24\
As we prepared to depart, Sister Jones\
asked how we knew of her urgent need\
8:31\
for a blessing. The truth is,\
we didn’t know.\
8:35\
However, our Heavenly Father,\
who was aware of a need,\
8:39\
did know and inspired President\
Chesnut to visit their home.\
8:44\
When we are receptive to the guidance\
of the still small voice,\
8:49\
we are better equipped to more\
effectively minister to those in need.\
8:55\
I testify of a kind and loving\
Heavenly Father.\
8:59\
Jesus Christ is the Savior\
and Redeemer of mankind.\
9:03\
I testify that the Atonement\
of Jesus Christ is real,\
9:07\
and that as we learn to follow the\
guidance of the Holy Ghost,\
9:11\
He will lead us to repent\
and use the power of\
9:15\
the Savior's Atonement in our lives.\
9:18\
President Russell M. Nelson is the true\
and living prophet of the Lord,\
9:23\
with all priesthood keys\
on the earth today.\
9:25\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
