I was baptized into The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints\
0:05\
on Christmas Eve of 1987,\
nearly 37 years ago.\
0:10\
That was a truly wonderful day in my\
life and in my eternal journey,\
0:16\
and I'm profoundly grateful for the\
friends who prepared the way\
0:21\
and brought me to the waters\
of that new birth.\
0:24\
Whether your baptism was\
yesterday or years ago,\
0:28\
whether you meet in a large multi-\
ward church building or under\
0:33\
a thatched canopy, whether you receive\
the sacrament in remembrance of\
0:36\
the Savior in Thai or Swahili,\
0:40\
I would like to say to you, welcome\
to the church of joy!\
0:46\
Welcome to the church of joy!\
Because of\
0:52\
the loving plan of our Heavenly Father\
for each of His children,\
0:56\
and because of the redeeming life and\
mission of our Savior Jesus Christ,\
1:00\
we can and should be the most\
joyful people on earth.\
1:06\
Even as the storms of life in an often\
troubled world pound upon us,\
1:11\
we can cultivate a growing and abiding\
sense of joy and inner peace\
1:16\
because of our hope in Christ and our\
understanding of our own place in\
1:21\
the beautiful plan of happiness.\
1:24\
The Lord’s senior apostle, President\
Russell M. Nelson,\
1:28\
has spoken of the joy that comes\
from a life centered\
1:31\
on Jesus Christ in nearly every address\
he has given since becoming\
1:36\
the president of the Church. He\
summed it up so concisely:\
1:40\
“Joy comes from and because of Him. ...\
For Latter-day Saints,\
1:46\
Jesus Christ is joy!” We are members\
of the Church of Jesus Christ.\
1:55\
We are members of the church of joy!\
2:00\
And nowhere should our joy as\
2:03\
a people be more apparent than when we\
gather together each Sabbath in our\
2:08\
sacrament meetings to worship\
the Source of all joy.\
2:13\
Here we assemble with our ward and\
branch families to celebrate\
2:17\
the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper\
and our deliverance from sin\
2:22\
and death and the Savior's\
powerful grace.\
2:25\
Here we come to experience the joy,\
refuge, forgiveness, thanksgiving,\
2:32\
and belonging found through\
Jesus Christ.\
2:36\
Is this spirit of collective rejoicing\
in Christ what you find?\
2:42\
Is this what you bring? Maybe you think\
this doesn't have much to do with\
2:47\
you, or perhaps you're simply used to\
how things have always been done.\
2:52\
But we can all contribute, no matter\
our age or our calling,\
2:57\
to making our sacrament meetings\
the joy-filled, Christ-focused,\
3:03\
welcoming hour they can be, alive with\
a spirit of joyful reverence.\
3:11\
“Joyful reverence—is that a thing?”\
you may ask. Well, yes it is.\
3:16\
We deeply love, honor,\
and respect our God,\
3:20\
and our reverence flows from a soul that\
rejoices in Christ's abundant love,\
3:26\
mercy, and salvation. This\
joyful reverence to\
3:31\
the Lord characterizes our sacred\
sacrament meetings.\
3:36\
However, for many, reverence\
only means this:\
3:43\
Folding our arms tightly around\
our chest, bowing our heads,\
3:48\
closing our eyes, and holding\
still ... indefinitely.\
3:55\
This might be a helpful way to teach\
energetic young children,\
4:02\
but as we grow and learn,\
4:04\
let us see that reverence is\
so much more than this.\
4:10\
Is that how we would be if the\
Savior were with us? No, for\
4:16\
“in [His] presence is fullness of joy”!\
4:21\
Well, for many of us, this\
transformation in sacrament services\
4:25\
will take practice. We do not gather on\
4:29\
the Sabbath simply to attend sacrament\
meeting and check it off a list.\
4:34\
We come together to worship.\
4:37\
There is a significant difference\
between the two.\
4:40\
To attend means to be present at.\
4:42\
But to worship is to intentionally\
praise and adore our God in\
4:48\
a way that transforms us.\
4:50\
If we're gathering in remembrance\
of the Savior and\
4:53\
the redemption He has made possible,\
4:56\
our faces should reflect\
our joy and gratitude.\
5:01\
Elder F. Enzio Busche once told\
the story of when he was\
5:04\
a branch president, and a young boy in\
the congregation looked at him on\
5:09\
the stand and asked loudly,\
5:11\
“What is the man with that mean\
face doing up there?”\
5:17\
Those who sit on the stand as speakers,\
leaders, choirs,\
5:23\
and those who gather in the congregation\
communicate to each\
5:28\
other this welcome to the church of joy\
through the expressions they wear\
5:33\
on their faces.\
As we sing\
5:37\
are we joining together to\
praise our God and King,\
5:41\
no matter the quality of our voices?\
5:43\
Or are we just mumbling\
or not singing at all?\
5:48\
Scripture records that the\
song of the righteous is\
5:51\
a prayer to God in which His soul\
delights. So let’s sing and praise Him!\
5:59\
We center our talks and testimonies on\
Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ,\
6:03\
and the fruit of humbly living their\
gospel—fruits that are “sweet above all\
6:09\
that is sweet.” Then we truly “feast ...\
even until [we’re] filled,\
6:13\
that [we] hunger not,\
neither ... thirst,”\
6:16\
and our burdens become lighter\
through the joy of the Son.\
6:21\
The glorious focal point of our\
services is the blessing\
6:25\
and receiving of the sacrament itself,\
the bread and the water,\
6:28\
representing the atoning\
gift of our Lord and\
6:32\
the whole purpose of our gathering.\
6:34\
This is a sacred time of spiritual\
renewal, when we\
6:37\
witness anew that we are willing\
to take upon us\
6:40\
the name of Jesus Christ and make again\
the covenant to always remember\
6:45\
the Savior and keep His commandments.\
6:50\
In some seasons of life,\
we may approach\
6:53\
the sacrament with heavy hearts\
and overwhelming loads.\
6:56\
At other times we come free and\
unburdened from cares and troubles.\
7:01\
As we listen intently to the blessing\
of the bread and water\
7:05\
and partake of those sacred tokens,\
7:07\
we may feel to reflect on the\
sacrifice of the Savior,\
7:11\
His agonies in Gethsemane,\
His anguish on the cross,\
7:15\
and the sorrows and pains He\
endured on our behalf.\
7:21\
That will be what relieves our souls\
as we connect our suffering to His.\
7:26\
At other times we will feel to wonder\
with grateful awe at the exquisite\
7:33\
and sweet joy of what\
7:35\
Jesus’s magnificent\
7:36\
gift has made possible in our\
lives and in our eternities!\
7:41\
We will rejoice for what is yet to come—\
7:44\
our cherished reunion with our beloved\
Father and risen Savior.\
7:51\
We may have been conditioned to\
suppose that the purpose of\
7:55\
the sacrament is to sit in the pew,\
7:57\
thinking only about all the ways we\
messed up during the week before.\
8:04\
But let's turn that practice\
on its head.\
8:09\
In the stillness, we can ponder\
the many ways we have seen\
8:12\
the Lord relentlessly pursue\
us with His wonderful love.\
8:16\
That week, we can reflect on\
what it means to “discover\
8:19\
the joy of daily repentance.”\
8:21\
We can give thanks for the times the\
Savior entered into our struggles\
8:26\
and our triumphs, and the occasions\
where we felt His grace, forgiveness,\
8:31\
and power giving us strength\
to overcome our hardships\
8:35\
and bear our burdens with patience\
and even good cheer.\
8:40\
Yes, we ponder the sufferings\
8:43\
and injustices inflicted upon\
our Redeemer for our sin,\
8:47\
and that does cause sober reflection.\
8:49\
But we sometimes get stuck there\
in the garden, at the cross,\
8:55\
inside the tomb. We fail to move upward\
to the joy of the tomb bursting open,\
9:04\
the defeat of death, and Christ’s\
victory over all that might prevent us\
9:08\
from gaining peace and returning\
to our heavenly home.\
9:12\
Whether we shed tears of sorrow\
or tears of gratitude during\
9:16\
the sacrament, let it be in awesome\
wonder at the good news of\
9:22\
the Father’s gift of His Son.\
9:27\
Now, for parents of children who are\
young or who have special needs,\
9:30\
there is often no such thing\
as a time of stillness\
9:33\
and quiet reflection during\
the sacrament.\
9:37\
But in small moments throughout the\
week you can teach by example\
9:41\
the love, gratitude, and joy you\
feel for and from the Savior\
9:45\
as you constantly care\
for His little lambs.\
9:49\
No effort in this pursuit is wasted,\
and God is so aware of you.\
9:56\
Likewise at home, we can begin to\
enhance our hopes and expectations\
10:01\
for our time at church.\
In family councils,\
10:04\
we can discuss how each individual can\
contribute in meaningful ways to\
10:09\
welcoming all to the church of joy.\
10:12\
We can plan and expect to have a\
joyful experience at church.\
10:18\
The ward council can\
envision and create\
10:20\
a culture of joyful reverence\
for our sacrament hour,\
10:23\
identifying practical steps\
and visual cues to help.\
10:29\
Joy looks different for\
different people.\
10:31\
For some it may be exuberant\
greetings at the door.\
10:35\
For others, it might be quietly helping\
people feel comfortable by smiling\
10:39\
and sitting next to them with\
a kind and open heart.\
10:43\
For those who feel left\
out or on the margins,\
10:47\
the warmth of this welcome\
will be crucial.\
10:51\
Ultimately, we can ask ourselves how\
10:55\
the Savior would want our\
sacrament hour to be.\
10:59\
How would He want each one of His\
children to be welcomed, cared for,\
11:04\
nourished, and loved? How would He want\
us to feel when we come to be renewed\
11:11\
through remembering and worshiping Him?\
11:16\
At the start of my journey of faith,\
11:20\
joy in Jesus Christ was my first great\
discovery, and it changed my world.\
11:27\
If you have yet to discover\
this joy, embark on its quest.\
11:33\
This is an invitation to receive\
the Savior's gift of peace,\
11:37\
light, and joy; to revel in it,\
to wonder at it,\
11:42\
and to rejoice in it every Sabbath.\
11:46\
Ammon in the Book of Mormon expresses\
the feelings of my heart when he says,\
11:52\
“Now have we not reason to rejoice?\
11:56\
Yea, I say unto you, there never\
were [a people] that had\
11:59\
so great reason to rejoice as\
we, since the world began;\
12:03\
yea, and my joy is carried away,\
even unto boasting in my God;\
12:07\
for he has all power, all wisdom,\
and all understanding;\
12:13\
he comprehendeth all things,\
and he is a merciful Being,\
12:19\
even unto salvation to those who will\
repent and believe on his name.\
12:25\
Now if this is\
12:27\
boasting, even\
12:28\
so will I boast; for this is\
my joy, my life, my light, ...\
12:34\
and my great thanksgiving.” Welcome\
to the church of joy.\
12:42\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
