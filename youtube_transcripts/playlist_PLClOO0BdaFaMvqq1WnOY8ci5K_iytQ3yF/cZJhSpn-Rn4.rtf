On June first of 1843, Addison Pratt\
left Nauvoo, Illinois,\
0:07\
to preach the gospel in the Hawaiian\
Islands leaving his wife,\
0:11\
Louisa Barnes Pratt, to care\
for their young family.\
0:15\
As persecutions in Nauvoo intensified,\
0:18\
forcing the Saints to leave, and\
later at Winter Quarters\
0:22\
as they prepared to migrate\
to the Salt Lake Valley,\
0:24\
Louisa faced the decision of whether\
to make the journey.\
0:29\
It would have been easier\
to stay and to wait\
0:32\
for Addison to return than\
to travel alone.\
0:36\
On both occasions, she sought guidance\
from the prophet Brigham Young,\
0:40\
who encouraged her to go.\
Despite the great difficulty\
0:45\
and her personal reluctance, she\
successfully made the journey each time.\
0:50\
Initially, Louisa found little\
joy in traveling.\
0:54\
However, she soon began to welcome\
the green prairie grass,\
0:58\
the colorful wildflowers, and patches\
of ground along the riverbanks.\
1:04\
“The gloom on my mind\
wore gradually away,” she recorded,\
1:08\
“and there was not a more mirthful\
woman in the whole company.”\
1:13\
Louisa's story has deeply inspired me.\
1:16\
I admire her willingness to set aside\
her personal preferences,\
1:21\
her ability to trust God,\
1:23\
and how exercising her faith helped her\
to see the situation differently.\
1:29\
She has reminded me that we have a\
loving Father in Heaven who cares\
1:34\
for us wherever we are, and that we\
can trust Him more than anyone\
1:40\
or anything else. God trusts us to\
make many important decisions,\
1:46\
and, in all matters, He asks\
us to trust Him.\
1:51\
This is especially difficult\
when our judgment,\
1:54\
or public opinion, differs from\
His will for His children.\
1:58\
Some suggest that we should redraw\
the lines between what is right\
2:02\
and what is wrong because they\
say that truth is relative,\
2:05\
reality is self-defined, or that God is\
2:09\
so generous that He does not actually\
care about what we do.\
2:14\
As we seek to understand\
and accept God's will,\
2:18\
it is helpful to remember that\
the boundaries between right\
2:22\
and wrong are not for us to define.\
2:25\
God has established these boundaries\
Himself, based on eternal truths\
2:30\
for our benefit and blessing.\
2:33\
The desire to change God's eternal\
truth has a long history.\
2:36\
It started before the world began, when\
Satan rebelled against God’s plan,\
2:41\
seeking selfishly to destroy\
human agency.\
2:45\
Following this pattern, people\
like Sherem, Nehor,\
2:49\
and Korihor have argued that faith is\
foolish, revelation is irrelevant,\
2:55\
and whatever we want to do is right.\
2:58\
Sadly, so very often, these deviations\
from God’s truth have led to great\
3:04\
sorrow. While some things may depend\
on context, not everything does.\
3:12\
President Russell M. Nelson has\
consistently taught that God’s saving\
3:17\
truths are absolute, independent,\
and defined by God Himself.\
3:26\
Whom we choose to trust is one of\
life’s important decisions.\
3:30\
King Benjamin instructed his people,\
“Believe in God; believe that he is;\
3:37\
believe that he has all wisdom;\
3:40\
believe that man doth not comprehend\
all of the things which\
3:44\
the Lord can comprehend.”  Fortunately,\
3:47\
we have the scriptures and guidance\
from living prophets to help us\
3:51\
understand God's truth. If clarification\
beyond what we have is\
3:56\
needed, God provides it\
through His prophets.\
3:59\
And He will respond to our sincere\
prayers through the Holy Ghost\
4:03\
as we seek to understand truths we\
do not yet fully appreciate.\
4:09\
Elder Neil L. Andersen once taught that\
we should not be surprised “if at times\
4:14\
[our] personal views are not initially\
in harmony with the teachings of\
4:18\
the Lord’s prophet. These are moments\
of learning,” he said, “of humility,\
4:24\
when we go to our knees in prayer.\
4:27\
We walk forward in faith,\
trusting in God,\
4:31\
knowing that with time we will receive\
more spiritual clarity from our\
4:36\
Heavenly Father.” At all times,\
4:39\
it's helpful to remember Alma's teaching\
that God gives His Word\
4:43\
according to the attention and\
effort we devote to it.\
4:48\
If we heed God’s word,\
we will receive more;\
4:53\
If we ignore His counsel,\
4:55\
we will receive less and less\
until we have none.\
5:02\
This loss of knowledge does not\
mean that the truth was wrong;\
5:06\
rather, it shows that we have lost\
the capacity to understand it.\
5:11\
In Capernaum, the Savior taught about\
His identity and mission.\
5:15\
Many found His words difficult to hear,\
5:18\
leading them to turn their backs\
and “[walk] no more with him.”\
5:23\
Why did they walk away? Because\
they did not like what He said.\
5:31\
So, trusting their own judgment,\
they walked away,\
5:35\
denying themselves blessings that\
would have come had they stayed.\
5:40\
It is easy for our pride to come\
between us and eternal truth.\
5:43\
When we don’t understand,\
5:45\
we can pause, let our feelings settle,\
and then choose how to respond.\
5:49\
The Savior urged us to “look unto [Him]\
in every thought; doubt not, fear not.”\
5:55\
When we focus on the Savior, our faith\
can start to overcome our concerns.\
6:00\
As Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf\
encouraged us to do,\
6:04\
“Please, first doubt your doubts\
before you doubt your faith.\
6:07\
We must never allow doubt to hold\
us prisoner and keep us from\
6:13\
the divine love, peace, and gifts that\
come through the through faith in\
6:18\
the Lord Jesus Christ.” As the\
disciples walked away from\
6:22\
the Savior that day, He then asked\
the Twelve, “Will ye also go away?”\
6:28\
Peter answered: “Lord,\
to whom shall we go?\
6:32\
Thou hast the words of eternal life.\
6:35\
And we believe and are\
sure that thou art,\
6:39\
that Christ, the Son of the living God.”\
6:43\
Now, the Apostles lived\
in the same world\
6:46\
and they faced the same\
social pressures as\
6:49\
the disciples who walked away.\
6:51\
However, in this moment, they chose\
their faith and trusted God,\
6:55\
thus preserving blessings God\
gives to those who stay.\
7:01\
Perhaps you, like me, sometimes find\
yourself on both sides of this decision.\
7:06\
When we find it difficult to understand\
or embrace God’s will,\
7:10\
it is comforting to remember that He\
loves us as we are, wherever we are.\
7:16\
And He has something better for us.\
7:19\
If we reach out to Him,\
He will assist us.\
7:24\
While reaching out to Him\
can be difficult,\
7:26\
just as the father who sought healing\
for his son was told by the Savior,\
7:30\
“all things are possible\
to him that believeth.”\
7:33\
In our moments of struggle, we too can\
cry out, “Help thou [my] unbelief.”\
7:42\
Editor Neal A. Maxwell once taught that\
the “submission of one’s will is really\
7:47\
the only uniquely personal thing we\
have to place on God’s altar.”\
7:51\
No wonder King Benjamin was so eager\
that his people become “as a child,\
7:55\
submissive, meek, humble, patient,\
full of love,\
8:01\
willing to submit to all things which\
the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him,\
8:05\
even as a child doth submit\
to his father.”\
8:08\
As always, the Savior set the perfect\
example for us. With a heavy heart,\
8:13\
and knowing the painful work He had to\
do, He submitted to His Father’s will,\
8:17\
fulfilling His messianic\
mission and opening\
8:20\
the promise of eternity to you and me.\
8:23\
The choice to submit our will to God's\
is an act of faith that lies at\
8:28\
the heart of our discipleship.\
8:30\
In making that choice, we discover that\
our agency is not diminished;\
8:34\
rather, it is magnified and rewarded\
by the presence of\
8:38\
the Holy Ghost, who brings purpose, joy,\
peace, and hope\
8:43\
we can find nowhere else.\
8:45\
Several months ago, a stake president\
and I visited a sister in his stake\
8:50\
and her young adult son. After\
years away from the Church,\
8:53\
wandering difficult and unfriendly\
paths, she had returned.\
8:58\
During our visit, we asked her\
why she had come back.\
9:01\
“I had made a mess of my life,” she\
said, “and I knew where I needed to be.”\
9:07\
I then asked her what she had learned\
in her journey. With some emotion,\
9:12\
she shared that she had learned that she\
needed to attend church long enough\
9:15\
to break the habit of not coming,\
9:17\
and that she needed to stay until\
it was where she wanted to be.\
9:22\
Her return was not easy, but as she\
exercised faith in the Father’s plan,\
9:26\
she felt the Spirit return.\
9:28\
And then she added, “I have learned\
for myself that God is good\
9:33\
and that His ways are better than mine.”\
9:37\
I bear witness of God, our Eternal\
Father, who loves us; of His Son,\
9:43\
Jesus Christ, who saved us. They\
know our hurts and challenges.\
9:48\
They will never forsake us and know\
perfectly how to succor us.\
9:54\
We can be of good cheer as we trust Them\
more than anyone or anything else.\
10:02\
In the sacred name\
of Jesus Christ, amen.\
