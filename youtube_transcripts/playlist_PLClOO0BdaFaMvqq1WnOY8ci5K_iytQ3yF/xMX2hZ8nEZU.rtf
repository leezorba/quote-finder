For several years, I was assigned to\
home teach an older sister in my ward.\
0:06\
She did not have an easy life.\
0:08\
She had various health problems\
and experienced\
0:11\
a lifetime of pain due to a childhood\
accident on the playground.\
0:15\
Divorced at age 32 with four young\
children to raise and provide for,\
0:20\
she remarried at age 50. Her second\
husband passed away when she was 66,\
0:26\
and this sister lived an additional\
26 years as a widow.\
0:31\
Despite her lifelong challenges,\
0:33\
she was faithful to her\
covenants to the end.\
0:36\
The sister was an avid genealogist,\
temple attender,\
0:40\
and a collector and writer\
of family histories.\
0:44\
Though she had many difficult trials,\
and without question\
0:47\
she felt at times sadness\
and loneliness,\
0:50\
she had a cheerful countenance and a\
gracious and pleasant personality.\
0:56\
Nine months after her passing,\
0:57\
one of her sons had a remarkable\
experience in the temple.\
1:01\
He learned by the power of the Holy\
Ghost that his mother had a message\
1:05\
for him. She communicated with him, but\
not by vision or audible words.\
1:11\
The following unmistakable message came\
into the son’s mind from his mother:\
1:16\
“I want you to know\
that mortality works,\
1:20\
and I want you to know that\
1:21\
I now understand why everything happened\
[in my life] the way it did,\
1:25\
and it is all okay.” The message is all\
1:30\
the more remarkable when one considers\
her situation and the difficulties\
1:34\
the sister endured and overcame.\
Brothers and sisters, mortality works.\
1:40\
It is designed to work. Despite\
the challenges,\
1:44\
heartaches and difficulties we all face,\
1:46\
our loving, wise, and perfect Heavenly\
Father has designed\
1:50\
the plan of happiness such that\
we are not destined to fail.\
1:55\
His plan provides a way for us to\
rise above our mortal failures.\
2:00\
The Lord has said, “This is my work\
and my glory—to bring to pass\
2:04\
the immortality and\
eternal life of man.”\
2:07\
Nonetheless, if we are to be the\
beneficiaries of the Lord’s “work\
2:11\
and glory,” even “immortality\
and eternal life,”\
2:14\
we must expect to be schooled\
and taught,\
2:17\
and to pass through the refiner’s fire,\
sometimes to our utter limits.\
2:23\
To completely avoid the problems,\
2:25\
challenges, and difficulties of this\
world would be to sidestep\
2:29\
the process that is truly necessary\
for mortality to work.\
2:33\
And so we should not be surprised\
when hard times come upon us.\
2:38\
We will encounter situations that try us\
2:41\
and people who enable us to practice\
true charity and patience.\
2:45\
But we need to bear up under\
our difficulties\
2:48\
and remember as the Lord said,\
2:50\
“And whoso layeth down his\
life in my cause\
2:54\
for my name’s sake, shall find\
it again, even life eternal.\
2:58\
Therefore be not afraid of your enemies,\
[or your problems, challenges,\
3:03\
or the tests of this life],\
for I have decreed...\
3:05\
saith the Lord, that\
I will prove you in all things,\
3:09\
whether you will abide in my covenant,\
... that you may be found worthy.”\
3:14\
When we feel distraught or anxious\
about our problems,\
3:17\
or feel that we might be receiving more\
than our fair share of life's\
3:21\
difficulties, we can remember what the\
Lord said to the children of Israel,\
3:26\
“And thou shalt remember\
all the way[s] which\
3:28\
the Lord thy God led thee these\
forty years in the wilderness,\
3:31\
to humble thee, and to prove thee,\
to know what [is] in thine heart,\
3:36\
whether thou wouldest keep his\
commandments or no.”\
3:39\
As Jacob taught his—or excuse me,\
as Lehi taught his son Jacob:\
3:44\
“Thou hast suffered afflictions\
and much sorrow...\
3:47\
nevertheless ... [God] shall consecrate\
thine afflictions for thy gain. ...\
3:51\
Wherefore, I know that thou\
art redeemed because of\
3:54\
the righteousness of thy Redeemer.”\
Because this life is a testing ground,\
3:59\
and “dark clouds of trouble hang o’er us\
and threaten our peace to destroy,”\
4:03\
it is helpful to remember this counsel\
4:05\
and promise found in Mosiah 23 relating\
to life’s challenges:\
4:10\
“Nevertheless—whosoever putteth\
his trust in the Lord,\
4:13\
the same shall be lifted\
up at the last day.”\
4:17\
As a youth, I personally experienced\
great emotional pain\
4:20\
and shame that came as the result of\
4:23\
the unrighteous actions\
of another which\
4:25\
for many years affected my self-worth\
and my sense of worthiness before\
4:29\
the Lord. Nevertheless, I bear\
personal witness that\
4:33\
the Lord can strengthen us\
4:35\
and bear us up in whatever difficulties\
we are called upon to experience during\
4:40\
our sojourn in this vale of tears. We\
are familiar with Paul’s experience:\
4:47\
“And lest I should be exalted above\
measure through the abundance of\
4:50\
the revelations [I have received], there\
was given to me a thorn in the flesh,\
4:55\
the messenger of Satan to buffet me,\
lest I should be exalted above measure.\
5:00\
For this thing I besought the Lord\
thrice, that it might depart from me.\
5:04\
And he said unto me, My grace\
is sufficient for thee,\
5:08\
for my strength is made\
perfect in weakness.\
5:11\
Most gladly, therefore, will I rather\
glory in my infirmities,\
5:15\
that the power of Christ\
may rest upon me.”\
5:19\
We don't know what Paul's\
thorn in the flesh was.\
5:21\
He chose not to describe whether\
it was a physical ailment,\
5:25\
a mental or emotional infirmity,\
or a temptation.\
5:28\
But we don't need to know that detail\
to know that he struggled\
5:32\
and pleaded with the Lord for help,\
and that ultimately,\
5:35\
the Lord's strength and power are\
what helped him through it.\
5:39\
Like Paul, it was through\
the Lord's help that\
5:41\
I was eventually strengthened\
emotionally and spiritually,\
5:44\
and finally recognized after many\
years that I have always been\
5:49\
a person of worth and worthy of\
the blessings of the gospel.\
5:53\
The Savior helped me overcome\
my feelings of unworthiness\
5:56\
and to extend sincere forgiveness\
to the offender.\
6:00\
I finally understood that the Savior's\
Atonement was a personal gift for me,\
6:04\
and that my Heavenly Father and His\
Son loved me perfectly. Because of\
6:08\
the Savior’s Atonement, mortality works.\
6:12\
While I was eventually blessed to\
recognize how the Savior rescued me\
6:16\
and stood by me through\
those experiences,\
6:18\
I clearly understand that\
6:20\
the unfortunate situation of my teenage\
years was my personal journey\
6:24\
and experience. The resolution of which\
6:27\
and eventual outcome cannot be projected\
onto those who have suffered\
6:32\
and continue to suffer from the\
unrighteous behavior of others.\
6:38\
I recognize that life's experiences,\
good and bad,\
6:42\
can teach us important lessons.\
6:44\
I now know and bear testimony\
that mortality works.\
6:49\
I hope that as a result of the sum of\
my life's experiences, good and bad,\
6:54\
I have compassion for innocent victims\
of another's actions and empathy\
6:58\
for the downtrodden. I sincerely\
hope that as\
7:02\
a result of my life’s experiences, good\
and bad, I am kinder to others,\
7:07\
treat others as the Savior would, have\
greater understanding for the sinner,\
7:11\
and that I have complete integrity. As\
we come to rely on the Savior’s grace\
7:17\
and keep our covenants, we\
can serve as examples of\
7:20\
the far-reaching effects of\
the Savior’s Atonement.\
7:24\
I share a final example that mortality\
works. My mother did not have\
7:31\
an easy journey through mortality.\
7:34\
She received no accolades\
or worldly honors\
7:37\
and did not have educational\
opportunities beyond high school.\
7:40\
She contracted polio as a child,\
7:43\
resulting in a lifetime of pain and\
discomfort in her left leg.\
7:48\
As an adult, she experienced many\
difficult and challenging physical\
7:52\
and financial circumstances,\
7:53\
but was faithful to her covenants\
and loved the Lord.\
7:57\
When my mother was 55, my next\
older sister passed away,\
8:01\
leaving an eight-month-old\
baby daughter, my niece,\
8:04\
motherless. For various reasons,\
8:07\
mom ended up largely raising my\
niece for the next 17 years,\
8:10\
often under very trying circumstances.\
8:13\
Yet, notwithstanding these experiences,\
8:15\
she happily and willingly served her\
family, neighbors, and ward members,\
8:19\
and served as an ordinance worker\
in the temple for many years.\
8:23\
During the last several\
years of her life,\
8:25\
mom suffered from a form of dementia,\
was often confused,\
8:29\
and was confined to a nursing facility.\
8:31\
Regrettably, she was alone when\
she passed away unexpectedly.\
8:37\
Several months after her passing, I had\
a dream I have never forgotten.\
8:41\
In my dream, I was sitting in my office\
at the Church Administration Building.\
8:45\
Mom entered the office. I knew she\
had come from the spirit world.\
8:49\
I will always remember\
the feelings I had.\
8:52\
She did not say anything,\
8:54\
but she radiated a spiritual beauty that\
I had never before experienced\
8:58\
and which I have difficulty describing.\
9:01\
Her countenance and being\
were truly stunning.\
9:05\
I remember saying to her, “Mother,\
you are so beautiful.”\
9:09\
Referencing her spiritual\
power and beauty.\
9:13\
She acknowledged me again\
without speaking.\
9:16\
I felt her love for me, and I\
knew then that she is happy\
9:19\
and healed from her worldly\
cares and challenges,\
9:23\
and eagerly awaits a glorious\
resurrection.\
9:27\
I know that for mom, mortality worked\
and that it works for us too.\
9:32\
God's work and glory is to bring\
to pass the immortality\
9:36\
and eternal life of man. The experiences\
of mortality are part of\
9:40\
the journey that allows us to grow and\
progress toward that immortality\
9:44\
and eternal life. We were\
not sent here to fail,\
9:48\
but to succeed in God's plan for us.\
9:51\
As King Benjamin taught, “And moreover,\
9:54\
I would desire that ye should\
consider on the blessed\
9:56\
and happy state of those that keep\
the commandments of God.\
9:59\
For behold, they are blessed in all\
things, both temporal and spiritual.\
10:03\
And if they hold out faithful to the\
end, they are received into heaven,\
10:08\
that thereby they may dwell with God in\
a state of never-ending happiness.”\
10:12\
In other words, mortality works.\
10:16\
I testify that as we receive the\
ordinances of the gospel,\
10:19\
enter into covenants with God, and then\
keep those covenants, repent,\
10:24\
serve others, and endure to the end,\
10:26\
we, too, can have the assurance\
and complete trust in\
10:30\
the Lord that mortality works.\
10:33\
I testify of Jesus Christ and that\
our glorious future with our\
10:36\
Heavenly Father is made possible by the\
grace and Atonement of the Savior.\
10:41\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
