My dear brothers and sisters,\
0:03\
I am grateful that the Lord has\
blessed me to speak with you.\
0:08\
My eyes are getting older.\
0:11\
So today I will present my message with\
the aid of a desktop teleprompter.\
0:19\
In this conference, the Lord has spoken\
to us through His servants.\
0:24\
I urge you to study their messages.\
0:28\
Use them as a litmus test of what\
is true and what is not\
0:33\
during the next six months.\
0:37\
The preservation and renovation of the\
Salt Lake Temple and other areas\
0:42\
on Temple Square has been underway\
for nearly five years.\
0:48\
Present projections indicate that\
this work will be completed by\
0:54\
the end of 2026.\
0:57\
We are grateful for all who are\
working on this massive project.\
1:05\
During the last six months,\
1:07\
we have dedicated or rededicated\
nine temples in five countries.\
1:13\
Between now and the end of the year,\
we will dedicate five more.\
1:19\
Today we are pleased to announce plans\
to construct 17 more temples.\
1:29\
Please listen reverently as\
I announce the locations.\

2:30\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
2:32\
do you see what is happening\
right before our eyes?\
2:38\
I pray that we will not miss\
the majesty of this moment.\
2:44\
The Lord is indeed hastening His work.\
2:50\
Why are we building temples at such\
an unprecedented pace? Why?\
2:56\
Because the Lord has instructed us to\
do so. The blessings of the temple\
3:03\
help to gather Israel on both sides\
of the veil. These blessings also\
3:11\
help to prepare a people who will\
help prepare the world for\
3:17\
the Second Coming of the Lord.\
3:21\
As the prophet Isaiah prophesied and as\
memorialized in Handel’s Messiah,\
3:29\
when Jesus Christ returns, “the glory\
of the Lord shall be revealed,\
3:37\
and all flesh shall see it together.”\
3:43\
In that day “the government shall\
be upon his shoulder:\
3:48\
and his name shall be called Wonderful,\
3:53\
Counsellor, the mighty God,\
the everlasting Father,\
3:58\
the Prince of Peace.” Jesus Christ will\
govern from old Jerusalem and\
4:06\
the New Jerusalem built upon\
the American continent.\
4:11\
From these two centers, He will direct\
the affairs of His Church.\
4:17\
In that day the Lord will be known as\
“King of Kings” and “Lord of Lords.”\
4:27\
Those who are with Him will be called\
and chosen and faithful.\
4:37\
Brothers and sisters, now is the time\
for you and for me to prepare for\
4:42\
the Second Coming of our Lord\
and Savior, Jesus the Christ.\
4:51\
Now is the time for us to make our\
discipleship our highest priority.\
4:58\
In a world filled with dizzying\
distractions, how can we do this?\
5:06\
Regular worship in the temple will\
help us. In the house of the Lord,\
5:12\
we focus on Jesus Christ. We learn of\
Him. We make covenants to follow Him.\
5:22\
We come to know Him. As we keep\
our temple covenants,\
5:28\
we gain greater access to the\
Lord's strengthening power.\
5:35\
In the temple, we receive protection\
from the buffetings of the world.\
5:42\
We experience the pure love of Jesus\
Christ and our Heavenly Father\
5:49\
in great abundance.\
5:53\
We feel peace and spiritual reassurance\
5:57\
in contrast to the turbulence\
of the world.\
6:04\
Here is my promise to you.\
6:07\
Every sincere seeker of Jesus Christ\
will find Him in the temple.\
6:15\
You will feel His mercy. You will find\
answers to your most vexing questions.\
6:23\
You will better comprehend\
6:27\
the joy\
6:30\
of His gospel. I have learned that\
6:34\
the most crucial question we\
each must answer is this:\
6:42\
To whom or to what will I give my life?\
6:49\
My decision to follow Jesus Christ\
is the most important decision\
6:55\
I have ever made. During medical school,\
7:00\
I gained a testimony of the divinity\
of God the Father and His Son,\
7:05\
Jesus Christ. Since then,\
7:10\
our Savior has been the rock upon\
which I have built my life.\
7:17\
That choice has made all the difference.\
7:23\
That decision has made so many\
other decisions easier.\
7:29\
That decision has given me\
purpose and direction.\
7:35\
It has also helped me weather\
the storms of life.\
7:42\
Let me share two examples.\
7:46\
First, when my wife Dantzel\
unexpectedly passed away,\
7:54\
I could not reach any of our children.\
8:00\
There I was alone, devastated,\
8:06\
and crying out for help.\
8:11\
Gratefully, through His Spirit,\
8:14\
the Lord has taught me why my dear\
Dantzel has been taken home.\
8:23\
With that understanding,\
I was comforted.\
8:26\
Over time I was better able\
to cope with my grief.\
8:33\
Later, I married my beloved wife Wendy.\
8:40\
She was a central part\
of my second example.\
8:45\
When Wendy and I were on an assignment\
in a distant land,\
8:49\
armed robbers put a gun to my\
head and pulled the trigger.\
8:59\
But the gun didn't fire. Throughout\
that experience,\
9:03\
both of our lives were threatened. Yet\
Wendy and I felt an undeniable peace.\
9:13\
It was the peace “which passeth\
all understanding.”\
9:18\
Brothers and sisters, the Lord\
will comfort you, too.\
9:23\
He will strengthen you. He will bless\
you with peace, even amidst chaos.\
9:33\
Please listen to this promise\
of Jesus Christ\
9:40\
to you, quote: “I will be on your\
right hand and on your left,\
9:48\
and my Spirit shall be in\
your hearts, and mine\
9:52\
angels round about you to\
bear you up.” End quote.\
9:58\
There is no limit to the Savior's\
capacity to help you.\
10:04\
His incomprehensible suffering\
in Gethsemane and on Calvary\
10:11\
was for you. His infinite\
Atonement is for you.\
10:19\
I urge you to devote time each week\
10:26\
for the rest of your life,\
10:29\
to increase your understanding of\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
10:35\
My heart aches for those who are mired\
in sin and don't know how to get out.\
10:43\
I weep for those who struggle\
spiritually,\
10:47\
or who carry heavy burdens alone\
10:51\
because they do not understand what\
Jesus Christ did for them.\
10:57\
Jesus Christ took upon Himself your\
sins, your pains, your heartaches,\
11:07\
and your infirmities. You do not\
have to bear them alone.\
11:17\
He will forgive you as you repent. He\
will bless you with what you need.\
11:25\
He will heal your wounded soul.\
As you yoke yourself to Him,\
11:32\
your burdens will feel lighter.\
If you will make\
11:39\
and keep covenants to\
follow Jesus Christ,\
11:43\
you will find that the painful moments\
of your life are temporary.\
11:52\
Your afflictions will be swallowed\
up in the joy of Christ.\
12:00\
It is neither too early or too\
late for you to become\
12:04\
a devout disciple of Jesus Christ.\
12:08\
Then you will experience fully the\
blessings of His Atonement.\
12:16\
You will also be more effective\
in helping to gather Israel.\
12:22\
My dear brothers and sisters,\
in a coming day,\
12:26\
Jesus Christ will return to the earth\
as the millennial Messiah.\
12:34\
So today I call upon you to rededicate\
your lives to Jesus Christ.\
12:42\
I call upon you to help gather scattered\
Israel and to prepare\
12:47\
the world for the Second\
Coming of the Lord.\
12:52\
I call upon you to talk of Christ,\
testify of Christ,\
12:57\
have faith in Christ, and\
rejoice in Christ.\
13:03\
Come unto Christ and offer\
your whole soul to Him.\
13:12\
This is the secret of a life of joy.\
13:19\
The best is yet to come, my\
dear brothers and sisters,\
13:22\
because the Savior is coming again.\
13:27\
The best is yet to come because the\
Lord is hastening His work.\
13:33\
The best is yet to come as\
we fully turn our hearts\
13:39\
and our lives to Jesus Christ.\
13:44\
I bear my solemn witness that Jesus\
Christ is the Son of God.\
13:50\
I am His disciple.\
13:54\
I’m honored to be His servant.\
14:00\
At His Second Coming,\
14:04\
the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,\
14:09\
and all flesh shall see it together.\
14:15\
That day will be filled with\
joy for the righteous.\
14:22\
Through the power of the sacred\
priesthood keys I hold,\
14:26\
I declare this truth to you and to all\
the world. In the name of Jesus Christ,\
14:35\
amen.\
