My dear brothers and sisters,\
0:03\
the history of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints in this\
0:06\
dispensation is resplendent with divine\
experiences that demonstrate how\
0:12\
the Lord has guided His Church.\
0:15\
There is one decade in\
our history, however,\
0:17\
that stands strikingly supreme\
above any other—\
0:20\
the decade from 1820 to 1830,\
0:25\
beginning with the Prophet Joseph\
Smith's experience in\
0:28\
the Sacred Grove in the spring of 1820,\
0:31\
when he saw God the Father and Jesus\
Christ, and continuing until April 6,\
0:37\
1830. That decade is unlike any other.\
Consider these remarkable events:\
0:44\
The young prophet conversed\
with the angel Moroni,\
0:47\
translated the gold plates, and\
published the Book of Mormon.\
0:51\
It was he through which the Aaronic\
0:53\
and Melchizedek Priesthoods\
were restored.\
0:56\
And then he organized the Church. Oliver\
Cowdery described that era well:\
1:02\
“These were days never to be forgotten.”\
1:06\
Miraculous events have continued\
to this very day.\
1:10\
May I be so bold as to suggest that\
this year we have commenced\
1:14\
a decade that may prove\
to be as momentous\
1:17\
as any that has followed that\
unparalleled founding decade two\
1:22\
centuries ago. Let me explain.\
Between now 2024 and 2034,\
1:29\
we will experience the seminal events\
that will result in extraordinary\
1:34\
opportunities to serve, to unite\
with members and friends,\
1:38\
and to introduce The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints to more\
1:43\
people than ever before. We just\
witnessed a truly historic moment\
1:49\
as we celebrated with tens of millions\
1:51\
the 100th birthday of President\
Russell M. Nelson.\
1:55\
Reporting on President\
Nelson's birthday,\
1:59\
Newsweek wrote a headline that read:\
“World’s Oldest Religious Leader Turns\
2:04\
100.” They then listed the 10\
oldest faith leaders,\
2:09\
with President Nelson first on\
2:11\
a list that included Pope\
Francis and Dalai Lama.\
2:15\
This statement from The New York\
Times article represents\
2:19\
the spirit of much of the international\
coverage, quote,\
2:22\
“In a presidential election cycle that\
has prompted soul searching about aging\
2:27\
and leadership, Mr. Nelson’s milestone\
suggests that, at least in his church,\
2:33\
a triple digit birthday does not\
merit much hand-wringing.\
2:38\
He remains a popular figure among church\
members who view their president\
2:43\
not just as an executive, but as\
a prophet, seer, and revelator.”\
2:50\
How grateful we are that President\
Nelson's landmark birthday gave us\
2:54\
an opportunity to introduce a global\
audience to a prophet of God,\
3:00\
a celebration never to be forgotten.\
3:04\
Earlier this spring, a refurbished\
plaza on Temple Square featuring\
3:09\
a display of international flags\
representing countries where\
3:14\
the Church is organized was unveiled.\
3:17\
The plaza entrance is marked by\
3:19\
a granite monument with\
these prophetic words:\
3:22\
“And it shall come to pass in the\
last days that the mountain of\
3:25\
the Lord's house shall be established\
in the top of the mountains,\
3:29\
and shall be exalted above the hills,\
and all nations shall flow unto it.”\
3:35\
Surely the monumental events\
that will occur during\
3:39\
the next 10 years constitute\
one manifestation\
3:43\
this prophecy of Isaiah\
is being fulfilled.\
3:48\
Contemplate the unprecedented\
number of temple open houses\
3:52\
and dedications that are planned to\
take place over the next decade,\
3:57\
even the potential of 164\
temples and counting.\
4:02\
Imagine tens of millions of you and\
your friends walking through\
4:08\
a house of the Lord. The symbolic\
center of these events will be\
4:13\
the rededication of the\
Salt Lake Temple and\
4:17\
the activities associated with it.\
4:19\
These will certainly be days\
never to be forgotten.\
4:25\
2030 will bring opportunities worldwide\
to commemorate the bicentennial of\
4:31\
the organization of the Church.\
4:34\
Although it's too early to say how\
4:35\
the Church will recognize\
this milestone,\
4:38\
it will certainly allow\
us to invite family, friends,\
4:41\
and colleagues and distinguished\
guests to come\
4:45\
and see and to better understand\
the powerful,\
4:48\
the powerful impact it has in\
the lives of Church members.\
4:53\
And in 2034, thousands of dignitaries,\
4:58\
visitors, and athletes from around\
the world will flood\
5:02\
the streets of Salt Lake City, the stage\
for the Winter Olympic Games.\
5:07\
There is perhaps no greater\
demonstration of worldwide unity than\
5:11\
that embodied in the Olympic Games.\
5:13\
The eyes of the world will be upon\
the Church and its members,\
5:18\
affording a multiple of opportunities\
to volunteer,\
5:22\
serve, and share glad tidings\
through kind deeds—\
5:26\
an event never to be forgotten.\
5:29\
These upcoming moments will provide\
members of the Church everywhere,\
5:33\
with increased opportunities\
to share glad tidings of\
5:38\
the gospel of Jesus Christ\
through word and deed.\
5:41\
A decade never to be forgotten.\
5:45\
In a meeting just weeks\
before his birthday,\
5:47\
President Nelson shared the reason he\
cherishes the phrase “glad tidings.”\
5:52\
On the face of it, he noted the phrase\
rings of joy and happiness,\
5:57\
but glad tidings convey\
much more than that.\
6:00\
He explained that this phrase comes from\
the original Greek word “euangelion,”\
6:07\
which literally means “good\
news” or the “gospel.”\
6:12\
Happiness and joy in this life and\
the next are always linked with\
6:17\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
6:19\
Thus, the phrase “glad tidings” captures\
this double meaning in\
6:23\
a wonderful way. “Men [and women]\
are that they might have joy.”\
6:28\
Heavenly Father has provided\
6:30\
the plan of happiness that enables\
joy through His blessings.\
6:35\
These include living in His presence\
eternally as families.\
6:40\
The Atonement of Jesus Christ is central\
to God’s plan. To receive\
6:44\
eternal life we must come unto Christ.\
As we do so and help others do\
6:50\
the same, we participate in God’s work\
of salvation and exaltation.\
6:55\
This message of the glad tidings of\
the gospel of Jesus Christ is\
6:59\
the most important message on earth,\
7:02\
and that is where the youth and young\
adults of the Church come in.\
7:07\
Now, while this upcoming decade may be\
filled with days never to be forgotten\
7:12\
for every member of the Church,\
7:13\
this especially can be true\
for the rising generation.\
7:17\
You are here on earth now because\
you were selected to be here now.\
7:20\
You have the strength and\
7:23\
the capacity to be disciples of Christ\
in an unprecedented way.\
7:28\
President George Q. Cannon taught,\
“God has reserved spirits\
7:32\
for this dispensation who have the\
courage and determination to face\
7:36\
the world, and all the powers\
of the evil one ...\
7:39\
and [to] build up the Zion of our God,\
fearless of all consequences.”\
7:45\
To that end, I wish to speak to\
you of the rising generation,\
7:49\
to invite you to imagine how\
exciting this next decade,\
7:53\
one never to be forgotten,\
can be for you.\
7:57\
I offer simple words of counsel\
8:00\
and encouragement that may empower\
you during this coming decade.\
8:05\
Like many of you, I have a smartphone\
that, on occasion, without any prompt,\
8:11\
pulls together a reel of photos showing\
what I was doing on a certain day.\
8:18\
It is always surprising to see how\
much things have changed for me\
8:22\
and my family in just a few years.\
Picture your photos\
8:28\
your phone will serve up\
10 years from now.\
8:32\
You may see yourself graduating\
from high school or college,\
8:36\
receiving your endowment, going\
on a mission, getting married,\
8:41\
and having your first child.\
8:43\
For you personally, this will be\
a decade never to be forgotten,\
8:50\
but it will be doubly so if you actively\
strive to become a light unto\
8:55\
the world of how the glad tidings of the\
gospel of Jesus Christ can enrich\
9:01\
and enhance not only your lives, but\
those of your family, friends,\
9:05\
and social media followers. You may\
be wondering how to do this.\
9:10\
Prophets of God have taught us this is\
done through four simple activities\
9:16\
referred to as “divinely appointed\
responsibilities.” First, living\
9:21\
the gospel of Jesus Christ. Second,\
caring for those in need.\
9:25\
Third, inviting all to receive\
the gospel. And fourth,\
9:30\
uniting families for eternity.\
9:33\
Remarkably, each can be done in the\
most normal and natural ways.\
9:39\
I promise this will be a decade\
never to be forgotten\
9:43\
for you if you embrace these divinely\
appointed responsibilities.\
9:48\
Let's consider what this might entail.\
First, love the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
9:54\
Study the words of the prophets and\
learn to love your Heavenly Father.\
9:58\
Incline your hearts to Him and\
strive to walk in His way.\
10:02\
Be lifted by the covenant confidence\
that Elder Ulisses Soares has described.\
10:08\
This confidence comes from making\
covenants to follow Jesus Christ,\
10:12\
knowing that the Savior will in turn\
strengthen and support you.\
10:16\
Let your friends see the joy you\
feel in living the gospel,\
10:19\
and you will be the best gospel\
message they ever receive.\
10:24\
Second, reach out in compassion\
to care for those in need.\
10:27\
Your generation is unusually mindful\
of the less fortunate.\
10:31\
Whenever disaster strikes and Church\
members rush to help clear away debris\
10:36\
and comfort the afflicted,\
10:38\
it seems the majority wearing Helping\
Hands T-shirts are teenagers\
10:43\
and 20-somethings. It is in your nature\
to bear one another’s burdens\
10:48\
and to comfort those that stand\
in need of comfort.\
10:50\
By doing this, we fulfill\
the law of Christ.\
10:54\
Evan, a young Primary-age boy,\
10:56\
decided to spend his summer vacation\
from school gathering supplies\
11:01\
for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches\
to donate to his local food bank.\
11:07\
He found the project on\
the JustServe website.\
11:10\
Young Evan enlisted his entire school\
class to help collect over 700 jars\
11:16\
of jelly. Let the people you serve\
know that your concern\
11:21\
for them is rooted in your love of God,\
11:24\
and your desire to treat your\
neighbor as yourself.\
11:28\
Third, invite all to receive the gospel.\
11:31\
This year, we open 36 new missions\
worldwide to accommodate all who have\
11:37\
a desire to serve full-time missions.\
11:39\
In an era when many youth are opting\
out of formal religious activity\
11:44\
altogether, this is remarkable\
and speaks to\
11:48\
the magnificent nature\
of your testimonies.\
11:52\
Whether serving full time or not,\
11:54\
please realize your immense capacity to\
influence your peers as you love,\
12:00\
share, and invite them to explore\
the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
12:06\
Fourth, unite families for eternity.\
12:10\
As I visit temples around the world,\
12:12\
I marvel at the standing-room-only\
crowds of youth waiting at\
12:16\
the baptistry and at the increased\
number of young adults serving\
12:21\
as ordinance workers. Recently,\
12:23\
a group of over 600 youth from Scotland\
and Ireland traveled to the Preston\
12:29\
England Temple, performing\
over 4,000 ordinances,\
12:34\
many of which were their personal\
deceased ancestors.\
12:39\
I urge you to become engaged in family\
history. Spend time in the temple.\
12:43\
Carefully prepare yourself to\
be the kind of man\
12:47\
or woman ready to marry an equally\
worthy companion in the temple.\
12:53\
Develop a pattern in your life\
now to make the temple\
12:57\
a regular part of your lives.\
13:00\
My beloved brothers and sisters,\
my dear young friends,\
13:03\
there will be likely difficulties for\
each of us in the days ahead.\
13:09\
However, as we enter this coming decade\
of unprecedented moments,\
13:15\
may we share glad tidings through the\
simple activities of loving, caring,\
13:21\
inviting, and uniting. As we do so,\
13:24\
the Lord will bless us with experiences\
never to be forgotten.\
13:30\
I testify that to those who approach\
the Lord with a sincere heart\
13:34\
and real intent, to those who have the\
name of the Savior upon their lips\
13:40\
and the Holy Spirit in their souls,\
13:42\
to those who embark upon this grand\
and glorious pilgrimage,\
13:47\
you will discover and experience\
bounteous celestial blessings\
13:52\
and receive a witness that God hears\
you, knows you, and loves you.\
13:57\
You will experience days\
never to be forgotten.\
14:01\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
