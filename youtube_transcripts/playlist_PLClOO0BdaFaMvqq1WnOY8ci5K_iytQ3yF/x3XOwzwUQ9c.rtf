In a world\
0:01\
filled with contention and division,\
0:04\
where civil discourse has been replaced\
with judgment and scorn,\
0:07\
and friendships are defined\
by -isms and -ites,\
0:12\
I have come to know that\
there is a clear,\
0:14\
simple, and divine example we can look\
to for unity, love, and belonging.\
0:22\
That example is Jesus Christ. I testify\
that He is the great Unifier.\
0:28\
In December of 1832, as appearances\
of troubles among\
0:32\
the nations were becoming more visible\
than at any time since\
0:35\
the organization of the Church, Latter-\
day Saint leaders in Kirtland, Ohio,\
0:40\
gathered for a conference.\
0:42\
They prayed separately and vocally to\
the Lord to reveal His will unto them.\
0:48\
In acknowledgment of the prayers of\
these faithful members during times of\
0:52\
intense trouble, the Lord\
comforted them,\
0:55\
addressing the saints three times\
with two powerful words: “my friends.”\
1:01\
Jesus Christ has long called\
His faithful followers His\
1:07\
friends. Fourteen times in the\
Doctrine and Covenants,\
1:11\
the Savior uses the term “friend”\
to define a sacred\
1:15\
and cherished relationship.\
1:17\
Now, I’m not talking about the word\
“friend” as the world defines it,\
1:22\
subject to social media\
followers or likes.\
1:25\
It cannot be captured in a hashtag\
or a number on Instagram or X.\
1:30\
Admittedly, as a teenager,\
1:33\
I remember dreaded conversations when I\
heard these painful words: “Hey, can,\
1:40\
can we just be friends?” Or “Let’s\
just stay in the friend zone.”\
1:48\
Nowhere in holy writ do we hear Him\
say, “Ye are just my friends.”\
1:55\
Rather, He taught that “greater\
love hath no man than this,\
1:59\
that a man lay down his\
life for his friends.”\
2:03\
And “Ye are they whom my Father hath\
given me; ye are my friends.”\
2:10\
The sentiment is clear—the Savior\
numbers each of us and watches over us.\
2:15\
This watch care is not trivial\
or insignificant.\
2:18\
Rather, it is exalting,\
elevating, and eternal.\
2:23\
I see the Savior’s declaration\
“Ye are my friends”\
2:26\
as a clarion call to build higher\
2:28\
and holier relationships among all of\
God’s children “that we may be one.”\
2:36\
We do this as we come together,\
2:38\
seeking both opportunities to unite\
and a sense of belonging for all.\
2:43\
The Savior beautifully demonstrated this\
in His call to “come, follow me.”\
2:47\
He drew upon the gifts of individual\
and individual attributes of\
2:51\
a diverse group of followers\
to call His Apostles.\
2:54\
He called fishermen, zealots,\
2:57\
brothers known for their thunderous\
personalities, and even a tax collector.\
3:03\
Their belief in the Savior and desire\
to draw unto Him united them.\
3:09\
They looked to Him, saw God through Him,\
3:13\
and straightway left their\
nets and followed Him.\
3:17\
I, too, have seen how building higher\
3:19\
and holier relationships brings\
us together as one.\
3:24\
My wife, Jennifer, and I were blessed\
to raise our five children in\
3:27\
New York City. There, in\
that busy metropolis,\
3:30\
we formed precious and sacred\
relationships with neighbors,\
3:33\
school friends, business associates,\
faith leaders, and fellow Saints.\
3:40\
In May of 2020, just as the world\
was grappling with the spread of\
3:44\
a global pandemic, members of\
3:47\
the New York City Commission of\
Religious Leaders met virtually in\
3:50\
an abruptly called meeting. There was\
no agenda. No special guests.\
3:55\
Just a request to come\
together and discuss\
3:58\
the challenges we were all\
facing as faith leaders.\
4:02\
The Center for Disease Control had\
just reported that our city was\
4:06\
the epicenter of the covid-19 pandemic\
in the United States.\
4:10\
This meant no more gathering,\
4:13\
no more coming together. For\
these religious leaders,\
4:17\
removing the personal ministry,\
4:19\
the congregational gathering,\
and the weekly worship was\
4:22\
a devastating blow. Our small group,\
which included a Cardinal, Reverend,\
4:27\
Rabbi, Imam, Pastor, Monsignor, and\
an Elder, listened to, consoled,\
4:34\
and supported one another.\
4:36\
Instead of focusing on our differences,\
we saw what we had in common.\
4:43\
We spoke of possibilities\
and then probabilities.\
4:46\
We rallied and responded to questions\
about faith and the future.\
4:51\
And then we prayed. Oh, how we prayed.\
4:57\
In a richly diverse city filled with\
complexity and colliding cultures,\
5:01\
we saw our differences dissipate as we\
came together as friends with one voice,\
5:08\
one purpose, and one prayer.\
5:12\
No longer were we looking across\
the table at each other,\
5:18\
but heavenward with each other.\
5:23\
We left each subsequent meeting more\
united and ready to pick up our shovels\
5:27\
and go to work. The collaboration\
that resulted,\
5:30\
and the service rendered to\
thousands of New Yorkers,\
5:32\
taught me that in a world calling\
for division, distance,\
5:36\
and disengagement, there is always much\
more that unites us than divides us.\
5:43\
The Savior pled, “Be one; and if you’re\
not one, you’re not mine.”\
5:49\
Brothers and sisters, we must stop\
looking for reasons to divide\
5:55\
and seek opportunities to be one.\
5:59\
He has blessed us with unique gifts\
6:00\
and attributes that invite learning from\
one another and personal growth.\
6:05\
I often told my university students\
that if I do what you do\
6:08\
and you do what I do, we\
don't need each other.\
6:13\
But because you don't do what I\
do and I don't do what you do,\
6:17\
we do need each other. And that\
need brings us together.\
6:23\
To divide and conquer is the\
adversary's plan to destroy\
6:27\
friendships, families, and faith.\
6:30\
It is the Savior who unites. One of\
6:35\
the promised blessings of becoming one\
is a powerful sense of belonging.\
6:39\
Elder Quentin L. Cook taught that,\
6:41\
“The essence of truly belonging\
is to be one with Christ.”\
6:47\
On a recent visit with my family to\
the West African country of Ghana,\
6:51\
I was enamored with a local custom.\
6:55\
Upon arriving at a church or a home,\
6:58\
we were greeted with the\
words, “You are welcome.”\
7:01\
When food was served, our hosts would\
announce, “You are invited.”\
7:05\
These simple greetings were extended\
with purpose and intentionality.\
7:09\
“You are welcome.” “You are invited.”\
7:16\
We place similar sacred declarations\
on our meeting house doors.\
7:20\
But the sign “Visitors Welcome”\
is not enough.\
7:25\
Do we warmly welcome all who\
come through the doors?\
7:30\
Brothers and sisters, it is not enough\
to just sit in the pews.\
7:34\
We must heed the Savior's\
call to build higher\
7:37\
and holier relationships with all of\
God's children. We must live our faith.\
7:44\
My father often reminded me that\
simply sitting in a pew\
7:48\
on Sunday doesn't make\
you a good Christian,\
7:51\
any more than sleeping in a\
garage makes you a car.\
7:56\
We must live our life so that\
the world does not see us,\
8:02\
but sees Him through us. This does\
not take place only on Sundays.\
8:08\
It takes place at the grocery store,\
the gas pump, the school meeting,\
8:13\
the neighborhood gathering—\
8:14\
all places where baptized\
8:17\
and unbaptized members of our\
family work and live.\
8:22\
I worship on Sunday as a reminder\
that we need each other\
8:25\
and together we need Him.\
8:28\
Our unique gifts and talents\
that differentiate us in\
8:31\
a secular world unite us\
in a sacred space.\
8:34\
The Savior has called upon\
us to help one another,\
8:38\
lift one another, and edify each other.\
8:41\
This is what He did when He healed\
the woman with an issue of blood,\
8:46\
cleansed the leper who\
pled for His mercy,\
8:49\
counseled the young prince who\
asked what more he could do,\
8:52\
loved Nicodemus who knew\
8:55\
but faltered in his faith, and sat with\
the woman at the well who did not fit\
9:00\
the custom of the day but to whom He\
declared His messianic mission.\
9:05\
This to me is “church”—a place\
of gathering and recovery,\
9:11\
repair and refocus. As President\
Nelson has taught,\
9:14\
“The gospel net is the largest\
net in the world.\
9:17\
God has invited all to come unto Him.\
... There is room for everyone.”\
9:23\
Some may have had experiences that\
make you feel you do not belong.\
9:27\
The Savior’s message to you\
and me is the same:\
9:31\
“Come unto me, all ye that labor\
and are heavy laden,\
9:34\
and I will give you rest.”\
9:37\
The gospel of Jesus Christ is\
the perfect place for us.\
9:41\
Coming to church offers the\
hope of better days,\
9:43\
the promise that you are not alone,\
9:45\
and a family who needs us\
as much as we need them.\
9:49\
Elder D. Todd Christofferson affirms\
that “Being one with the Father, Son,\
9:54\
and Holy Spirit is without doubt\
9:56\
the ultimate in belonging.” To any who\
have stepped away and are seeking\
10:01\
a chance to return, I offer an eternal\
truth and invitation. You belong.\
10:09\
Come back. It is time. In a contentious\
and divided world,\
10:16\
I testify that the Savior, Jesus Christ,\
is the great Unifier.\
10:20\
May I invite each of us to be worthy of\
the Savior's invitation to be one,\
10:25\
and to boldly declare as He did,\
“Ye are my friends.”\
10:31\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
