This year, millions have been inspired\
by the gospel study plan known by\
0:08\
the Savior’s invitation\
“Come, Follow Me.”\
0:12\
Following Christ is not a casual\
or occasional practice.\
0:17\
It is a continuous commitment and\
way of life that should guide us\
0:23\
at all times and in all places.\
0:26\
His teachings and His example\
define the path\
0:30\
for every disciple of Jesus Christ.\
And all are invited to this path,\
0:38\
for He invites all to come unto Him,\
0:40\
“black and white, bond and free, male\
and female; and all are alike unto God.”\
0:49\
The first step in following Christ\
is to obey what He defined as\
0:54\
“the great commandment in the law.”\
0:56\
“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with\
all thy heart, and with all thy soul,\
1:03\
and with all thy mind. This is the\
first and great commandment.\
1:08\
And the second is like unto it, Thou\
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\
1:14\
On these two commandments hang\
all the law and the prophets.”\
1:20\
The commandments of God\
provide the guiding\
1:23\
and steadying force in our lives.\
1:27\
Our experiences in mortality are like\
the little boy and his father flying\
1:32\
a kite on a windy day. As\
the kite rose higher,\
1:37\
the winds caused it to tug on\
the connecting string in\
1:41\
the little boy's hand. Inexperienced\
with the force of mortal winds,\
1:47\
he proposed to cut the strings so\
the kite could rise higher.\
1:52\
His wise father counseled no,\
1:55\
explaining that the string\
is what holds\
1:58\
the kite in place against mortal winds.\
2:01\
If we lose our hold on the string,\
the kite will not rise higher;\
2:06\
it will be carried about by these winds\
and inevitably crash to the earth.\
2:13\
That essential string represents the\
covenants that connect us to God,\
2:18\
our Heavenly Father and\
His Son, Jesus Christ.\
2:23\
As we honor those covenants by\
keeping Their commandments\
2:27\
and following Their Plan of Redemption,\
2:31\
Their promised blessings enable us\
to soar to celestial heights.\
2:38\
The Book of Mormon frequently declares\
that Christ is the “light of the world.”\
2:44\
During His appearance to the Nephites,\
2:47\
the Risen Lord explained that\
teaching by telling them\
2:51\
“I have set an example for you.”\
2:54\
“I am the light which ye shall hold\
up—that which ye have seen me do.”\
3:01\
He is our role model. We learn\
that what He has said\
3:06\
and done by studying the scriptures\
and following prophetic teachings\
3:12\
as President Russell M. Nelson has urged\
us to do. In the ordinance of\
3:18\
the sacrament, we covenant\
each Sabbath day,\
3:22\
that we will always remember Him\
and keep His commandments.\
3:27\
In the Book of Mormon, the Lord gave us\
the fundamentals in what He called\
3:32\
“the doctrine of Christ.”\
These are faith in the\
3:36\
Lord Jesus Christ, repentance,\
3:40\
baptism, receiving the gift of the\
Holy Ghost, enduring to the end,\
3:47\
and becoming as a little child,\
3:50\
which means to trust the Lord and\
submit to all He requires of us.\
3:56\
The Lord’s commandments are\
of two types: permanent\
4:00\
like the doctrine of Christ,\
and temporary.\
4:05\
Temporary commandments are those\
necessary for the needs of\
4:10\
the Lord’s Church or the faithful\
in temporary circumstances,\
4:17\
but to be set aside when\
the need has passed.\
4:21\
An example of temporary commandments\
are the Lord's directions to\
4:25\
the early leadership of the Church\
4:27\
to move the Saints from\
4:31\
New York to Ohio,\
to Missouri, to Illinois,\
4:34\
and finally to lead the pioneer exodus\
to the intermountain west.\
4:40\
Though only temporary,\
when still in force,\
4:42\
these commandments were given to be\
4:46\
obeyed. Some permanent commandments\
have taken considerable time to be\
4:53\
generally observed. For example,\
4:57\
President Lorenzo Snow’s famous sermon\
on the law of tithing emphasized\
5:04\
a commandment given earlier but not\
5:07\
yet generally observed\
by Church members.\
5:11\
It needed re-emphasis in the\
circumstances then faced by\
5:16\
the Church and its members.\
5:19\
Recent examples of re-emphasis\
have also been needed\
5:24\
because of current circumstances faced\
by the Latter-day Saints or the Church.\
5:30\
These include the proclamation on\
5:33\
the family issued by President Gordon\
B. Hinckley a generation ago,\
5:39\
and President Russell M. Nelson’s\
recent call for\
5:44\
the Church to be known\
by its revealed name,\
5:47\
The Church of Jesus Christ\
of Latter-day Saints.\
5:52\
Another of our Savior's teachings\
seems to require re-emphasis in\
5:58\
the circumstances of our day.\
6:02\
This is a time of many harsh\
6:05\
and hurtful words in public\
communications\
6:09\
and sometimes even in our families.\
6:13\
Sharp differences on issues of public\
policy often result in actions of\
6:20\
hostility—even hatred—in public\
and personal relationships.\
6:27\
This atmosphere of enmity sometimes\
even paralyzes capacities\
6:33\
for law-making on matters of importance,\
6:36\
where most citizens see an urgent need\
for some action in the public interest.\
6:44\
What should followers of Christ teach\
6:47\
and do in this time of\
toxic communications?\
6:51\
What were His teachings and examples?\
6:56\
It is significant that among\
6:58\
the first principles Jesus taught\
when He appeared to\
7:01\
the Nephites was to avoid contention.\
7:06\
While He taught this in the context of\
disputes over religious doctrine,\
7:12\
The reasons He gave clearly\
apply to communications\
7:16\
and relationships in politics, public\
policy, and family relationships.\
7:24\
Jesus taught, quote, “He that hath the\
spirit of contention is not of me,\
7:30\
but is of the devil, who is\
the father of contention,\
7:36\
and he stirreth up the hearts of men to\
contend with anger one with another.\
7:43\
Behold, this is not my\
doctrine, to stir up\
7:47\
the hearts of men with anger,\
one against another;\
7:50\
but this is my doctrine, that such\
things should be done away.”\
7:55\
End of quote. In His remaining\
ministry among the Nephites,\
8:02\
Jesus taught other commandments closely\
related to this prohibition of\
8:08\
contention. We know from the Bible that\
He had previously taught each of these\
8:16\
in His great sermon on the mount,\
8:18\
usually in precisely the same language\
He later used with the Nephites.\
8:25\
I will quote the familiar\
Bible language.\
8:31\
“Love your enemies, bless\
them that curse you,\
8:35\
do good to them that hate you,\
8:38\
and pray for them which despitefully\
use you, and persecute you.”\
8:44\
This is one of Christ’s best\
known commandments—\
8:48\
most revolutionary and most\
difficult to follow.\
8:52\
Yet it is a most fundamental part of His\
invitation for all to follow Him.\
9:01\
As President David O. McKay taught,\
“There is no better way to manifest love\
9:08\
for God than to show an unselfish\
love for one’s fellowmen.”\
9:16\
Here is another fundamental teaching\
by Him who is our Role Model:\
9:21\
“Blessed are the peacemakers: for they\
shall be called the children of God.”\
9:30\
Peacemakers! How it would change\
personal relationships if followers of\
9:37\
Christ would forego harsh and hurtful\
words in all their communications.\
9:45\
In general conference last year,\
9:47\
President Russell M. Nelson\
gave us these challenges,\
9:51\
quote, “One of the easiest\
ways to identify\
9:55\
a true follower of Christ is how\
compassionately that person treats\
10:01\
other people. True disciples of\
Jesus Christ are peacemakers.\
10:08\
One of the best ways we can honor the\
Savior is to become a peacemaker,”\
10:16\
concluding his teachings. “Contention is\
a choice. Peacemaking is a choice.\
10:24\
You have your agency to choose\
contention or reconciliation.\
10:30\
I urge you to choose to be a\
peacemaker, now and always.”\
10:36\
End of quote. Potential adversaries\
should begin their discussions by\
10:44\
identifying common ground on which all\
agree. To follow our Perfect Role Model\
10:52\
and His prophet, we need to practice\
what is popularly known as\
10:57\
the Golden Rule: “all things whatsoever\
ye would that men should do to you,\
11:03\
do ye even so to them: for this\
is the law and the prophets.”\
11:11\
We need to love and do good to all.\
11:15\
We need to avoid contention\
11:17\
and be peacemakers in all\
of our communications.\
11:22\
This does not mean to compromise\
our principles and priorities,\
11:28\
but to cease harshly attacking\
others for theirs.\
11:34\
That is what our Perfect Role\
Model did in His ministry.\
11:39\
That is the example He set for us,\
as He invited us to follow Him.\
11:47\
In this conference four years ago,\
11:50\
President Nelson gave us a prophetic\
challenge for our own day:\
11:58\
“Are you willing to let God\
prevail in your life?\
12:03\
Are you willing to let God be the most\
important influence in your life?\
12:10\
Will you allow His words,\
His commandments,\
12:13\
and His covenants to influence\
what you do each day?\
12:18\
Will you allow His voice to take\
priority over any other?”\
12:26\
As followers of Christ, we teach\
and testify of Jesus Christ,\
12:32\
our Perfect Role Model. So let us follow\
Him by foregoing contention.\
12:40\
As we pursue our preferred policies\
in public actions,\
12:45\
let us qualify for His blessings\
by using the language\
12:49\
and methods of peacemakers.\
12:53\
In our families and other\
personal relationships\
12:56\
let us avoid what is harsh and hateful.\
13:01\
Let us seek to be holy, like our Savior,\
13:04\
in whose holy name I testify\
13:07\
and invoke His blessings\
to help us be Saints.\
13:12\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
