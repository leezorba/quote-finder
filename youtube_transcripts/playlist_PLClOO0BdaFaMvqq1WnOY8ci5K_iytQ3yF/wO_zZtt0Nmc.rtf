It is the Sabbath day, and we've\
gathered to speak of Christ\
0:08\
and Him crucified. I know\
that my Redeemer lives.\
0:16\
Consider this scene from the last\
week of Jesus's mortal life.\
0:22\
A multitude had gathered,\
0:24\
including Roman soldiers armed with\
staves and strapped with swords.\
0:31\
They were led by officers from\
0:33\
the chief priests who\
had torches in hand.\
0:37\
This earnest company was not off\
to conquer a city. Tonight,\
0:43\
they were looking for only one man,\
a man not known to carry a weapon,\
0:52\
receive military training,\
0:55\
or engage in physical combat at\
any time in his entire life.\
1:02\
As the soldiers approached, Jesus, in\
an effort to protect His disciples,\
1:08\
stepped forth and said, “Whom seek ye?”\
They replied, “Jesus of Nazareth.”\
1:18\
Jesus said, “I am he.\
As soon ... as he had said\
1:26\
unto them, I am he,\
1:30\
they went backward, and\
fell to the ground.”\
1:37\
To me that is one of the most stirring\
lines in all of holy scripture.\
1:45\
Among other things, it tells me\
straightforwardly that just being in\
1:52\
the presence of the Son of God—the\
great Jehovah of the Old Testament,\
1:58\
Good Shepherd of the New, who\
bears no weapon of any kind—\
2:03\
that just hearing the voice of\
this Refuge from the Storm,\
2:10\
this Prince of Peace, is enough to send\
antagonists stumbling into retreat,\
2:19\
piling them into a jumble,\
2:21\
making the whole group wish they’d been\
assigned kitchen duty that night.\
2:29\
Just a few days earlier, when He’d\
entered the city triumphantly,\
2:35\
“All the city was moved,”\
the scripture says.\
2:42\
“Who is this?” I can only imagine that\
“Who is this?”\
2:48\
is the question those muddled\
soldiers were now asking.\
2:55\
The answer to that question could\
not have been in His looks,\
3:00\
for Isaiah had prophesied some seven\
centuries earlier that “he hath no form\
3:08\
nor comeliness; and when\
we shall see him,\
3:12\
there is no beauty that\
we should desire him.”\
3:17\
It certainly wasn’t in His polished\
wardrobe, or His great personal wealth,\
3:23\
of which He had neither. It could not\
have been from professional training\
3:30\
in the local synagogues. We have no\
evidence that He ever studied at any of\
3:36\
them, though even in His youth He could\
confound superbly prepared scribes\
3:45\
and lawyers, astonishing them with His\
doctrine as “one having authority.”\
3:55\
From that teaching in the temple to His\
triumphant entry into Jerusalem,\
4:01\
and His final, unjustifiable arrest,\
4:06\
Jesus was routinely placed in difficult,\
often devious situations\
4:15\
in which He was always triumphant—\
4:19\
victories for which we have no\
explanation except His divine DNA.\
4:28\
Yet down through history,\
many have simplified,\
4:34\
even trivialized our image of Him\
and His witness of who He was.\
4:43\
They’ve reduced His righteousness\
to mere prudishness,\
4:49\
His justice to mere anger, His\
mercy to mere permissiveness.\
4:59\
We must not be guilty of such simplistic\
versions that conveniently\
5:08\
ignore teachings we find uncomfortable.\
5:15\
This dumbing down has been true even\
regarding His ultimate defining virtue,\
5:23\
His love. During His mortal mission,\
5:28\
Jesus taught that there were\
two great commandments.\
5:32\
It has been taught in this conference\
and will forever be taught.\
5:35\
Love the Lord thy God. Love\
thy neighbor as thyself.\
5:40\
If we're to follow the Savior faithfully\
in these two crucial\
5:47\
and inextricably linked rules,\
5:50\
we ought to hold firmly to what He\
5:54\
actually said and what He actually said\
6:01\
was, “If you love me, keep\
my commandments.”\
6:06\
And on that same evening, He said\
6:10\
we were to “love one another\
as I have loved you.”\
6:17\
In those scriptures, those qualifying\
phrases defining true Christlike love,\
6:26\
sometimes referred to as charity, those\
qualifiers are absolutely essential.\
6:35\
What do they define?\
How did Jesus love?\
6:41\
Well, first He loved with “all of [His]\
heart, might, mind, and strength,”\
6:47\
giving Him the ability to heal\
the deepest pain and declare\
6:55\
the hardest reality. In short,\
6:59\
He’s one who could administer grace and\
insist on truth at the same time.\
7:10\
As Lehi blessed his son Jacob:\
7:12\
“Redemption cometh in and through\
the Holy Messiah;\
7:18\
for he is full of grace and truth.”\
7:25\
His love allows an encouraging embrace\
when it's often needed,\
7:33\
and a bitter cup when occasionally\
it has to be swallowed.\
7:39\
So we try to love—with all of our heart,\
might, mind, and strength—\
7:46\
because that’s the way He loves us.\
7:51\
Now, the second characteristic of\
Jesus’s divine charity was His\
7:57\
obedience to every word that\
proceeded from God's mouth,\
8:04\
always aligning His will and His\
behavior with that of His\
8:11\
Heavenly Father. When He arrived\
8:15\
on this hemisphere following\
His Resurrection,\
8:19\
Christ said to the Nephites, “Behold,\
I am Jesus Christ. ...\
8:25\
I have drunk of that bitter cup which\
the Father hath given me, ...\
8:31\
in the which I have suffered the will\
of the Father ... from the beginning.”\
8:40\
Now of the myriad ways He could\
have introduced Himself,\
8:47\
Jesus did so by declaring His obedience\
to the will of the Father. Never mind—\
8:56\
Never mind that not long before\
this hour of greatest need,\
9:03\
this Only Begotten Son of God\
had totally felt totally\
9:09\
abandoned by His Father.\
9:14\
Christ’s charity, evident in complete\
loyalty to His divine will,\
9:20\
persisted and continues to persist.\
9:24\
And not just through\
the easy and comfortable days,\
9:31\
but especially through the darkest\
and most difficult ones.\
9:38\
Jesus was “a man of sorrows,”\
the scriptures say.\
9:42\
He experienced sadness, fatigue,\
disappointment,\
9:48\
and excruciating loneliness.\
9:53\
In these and in all times,\
9:57\
Jesus’s love faileth not and\
neither does His Father’s.\
10:04\
With such mature love, the\
kind that exemplifies,\
10:09\
empowers, and imparts, ours\
will not fail either.\
10:17\
If then sometimes the harder you try,\
the more difficult it seems to get;\
10:24\
if, just as you try to work on your\
limitations and your shortcomings\
10:30\
you find someone or something determined\
to challenge your returning\
10:36\
faith; if as you labor devotedly\
10:42\
you still feel moments of\
fear wash over you,\
10:49\
remember that it has been so for\
some of the most faithful\
10:55\
and marvelous people in\
every era of time.\
11:02\
Also, remember that there is\
11:04\
a force in this universe determined to\
oppose every good thing you try to\
11:14\
do. So through the abundance\
as well as poverty,\
11:21\
through private acclaim as\
well as public criticism,\
11:27\
through the divine elements\
of the Restoration,\
11:30\
as well as the human foibles that\
will inevitably be part of it,\
11:38\
we stay the course\
11:43\
with the true Church of Christ. Why?\
11:47\
Because, as with our Redeemer, we\
signed on for the whole term,\
11:54\
not ending with the first,\
short, introductory quiz,\
12:00\
but through to the final exam.\
12:03\
The joy in this is that the Headmaster\
gave us all open book answers before\
12:11\
the course began. Furthermore,\
12:15\
we have a host of tutors who remind us\
of these answers at regular stops along\
12:21\
the way. But of course, none of this\
works if we keep cutting class.\
12:32\
“Whom seek ye?” With all our hearts,\
we answer, “Jesus of Nazareth.”\
12:42\
And when He says, “I am He,”\
12:46\
we bow our knee and confess our tongue\
that He’s the living Christ,\
12:53\
that He alone atoned for our sins,\
12:56\
that He was carrying us even when\
we thought He had abandoned us.\
13:02\
When we stand before Him and see the\
wounds in His hands and feet,\
13:08\
we will begin to comprehend what it\
meant for Him to bear our sins\
13:12\
and be acquainted with grief,\
13:14\
to be completely obedient to\
the will of His Father. All\
13:19\
out of pure love for us, to introduce\
others to faith, repentance,\
13:27\
baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost,\
13:31\
and receiving our blessings as part\
of the temple experience.\
13:37\
We ask that the sacred blessings\
of the house of the Lord,\
13:43\
these fundamental principles\
13:46\
and ordinances that ultimately reveal\
our love of God and neighbor\
13:52\
and joyfully characterize the true\
Church of Christ, will be evident.\
13:57\
Brothers and sisters, I testify that The\
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\
14:03\
day Saints is the vehicle\
God has provided for\
14:08\
the exaltation of our souls.\
14:10\
The gospel it teaches is true,\
14:13\
and the priesthood legitimizing\
it is not derivative.\
14:19\
I testify that Russell M. Nelson\
is a prophet of our God,\
14:25\
and his predecessors were, as\
will his successors be.\
14:30\
And one day that prophetic\
generation will lead\
14:35\
a generation to see our Messenger of\
Salvation descend like “lightning out\
14:42\
of the east.” And He will exclaim, we\
will exclaim, “Jesus of Nazareth!”\
14:49\
And with arms forever outstretched and\
love unfeigned, He will reply,\
14:54\
“I am he.” I so promise with\
the apostolic power\
15:01\
and authority of His holy name,\
even Jesus Christ, amen.\
