In 1996, the Nigerian men's\
football team won gold at\
0:06\
the Olympic Games held in Atlanta\
in the United States.\
0:11\
As the final game ended,\
0:15\
jubilant crowds poured onto the\
streets of every major city\
0:20\
and town in Nigeria. This country of\
over 200 million people was instantly\
0:27\
transformed into a massive celebration\
at 2:00 in the morning.\
0:32\
There was infectious joy, happiness,\
excitement as people ate,\
0:39\
sang, and danced. Nigeria—\
0:43\
In that moment, Nigeria was united\
0:45\
and every Nigerian was content\
being Nigerian.\
0:51\
Before the Olympic Games,\
0:52\
this team faced numerous challenges.\
As the tournament began,\
0:58\
their financial support ended.\
1:01\
The team competed without proper kits,\
training venues,\
1:05\
food, or laundry services.\
1:07\
At one point they were minutes away\
from being eliminated from competition,\
1:13\
but the Nigerian team triumphed\
against all odds.\
1:17\
This pivotal moment changed how\
they saw themselves. With\
1:22\
a newfound confidence and with\
individual and team hard work\
1:27\
and dogged determination,\
1:30\
they unitedly ignored distractions\
and focused on winning.\
1:35\
This focus won them gold medals\
and Nigerians christened them\
1:42\
the “Dream Team.” The Dream Team at\
1:45\
the 1996 Olympics continues to be\
referenced in Nigerian sports.\
1:51\
Once the football team\
learned to ignore\
1:54\
the many distractions facing them\
and focused on their goal,\
1:59\
they succeeded beyond what they thought\
possible and experienced great joy,\
2:05\
as did the rest of us in Nigeria.\
2:09\
In a similar way, when we ignore\
the distractions of the world\
2:14\
and focus on Christ and His gospel,\
2:17\
we are guaranteed success beyond what\
we can fully imagine and\
2:25\
and can feel great joy. President\
Russell M. Nelson taught,\
2:31\
“When the focus of our lives is on\
Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel\
2:37\
joy regardless of what is happening—\
or not happening—in our lives.”\
2:43\
I pray that the Holy Ghost will\
help each of us to heed\
2:48\
President Nelson's invitation\
to focus our lives\
2:51\
on Jesus Christ and His gospel, so\
we can experience joy in Christ,\
2:56\
regardless of what is happening—\
or not happening—in our lives.\
3:01\
Several accounts in the Book of Mormon\
describe those who turned their lives\
3:06\
around by focusing on Jesus\
Christ and His gospel.\
3:10\
Consider Alma the Younger. He rebelled\
and fought against the church.\
3:15\
His father, Alma, prayed and fasted.\
3:18\
An angel appeared and taught Alma the\
Younger to repent.\
3:25\
In that moment, Alma began to suffer\
the “pains of a damned soul.”\
3:32\
In dark hours, he remembered his\
father's teaching that Christ would\
3:37\
come to atone for the sins of the world.\
3:41\
As his mind caught hold—focused—\
on this thought,\
3:45\
he pled with God for mercy.\
Joy was the result—\
3:50\
a joy he described as exquisite.\
The mercy\
3:55\
and joy came to Alma because he and\
his father focused on the Savior.\
4:02\
For parents who have children who\
have strayed, take heart.\
4:08\
Instead of wondering why an angel does\
not come to help your child repent,\
4:14\
know that the Lord has placed a mortal\
angel in his or her path:\
4:19\
the bishop, another Church leader, or\
a ministering brother or sister.\
4:24\
If you keep fasting and praying,\
4:27\
if you do not set a timetable\
or a deadline for God,\
4:31\
and if you trust that He is stretching\
forth His hand to help,\
4:37\
then sooner or later you will find God\
touching the heart of your child\
4:42\
when your child chooses to listen.\
This is because Christ is joy.\
4:49\
Christ is hope. He is the promise\
of good things to come.\
4:55\
So trust Jesus with your child,\
4:58\
for He is the strength of every\
parent and of every child.\
5:04\
Once Alma had experienced joy in Christ,\
5:10\
Alma the younger lived with that joy.\
5:14\
And how did he maintain such good, such\
joy, even through difficulty and trials?\
5:24\
“From that time,” Alma states,\
“...even until now,\
5:28\
I have labored without ceasing ...\
5:31\
to bring souls unto Christ,\
5:33\
that I might bring them to taste\
of the exceeding joy of which\
5:38\
I did taste ... and ...\
5:41\
the Lord doth give me exceeding great\
joy in the fruit of my labors ...\
5:46\
and I have been supported under trials\
and troubles of every kind.”\
5:52\
Joy in Christ began for Alma when he\
began to exercise faith in Christ\
5:59\
and cried for mercy, then Alma\
exercised faith in Jesus Christ by\
6:05\
laboring to help others\
taste of the same joy.\
6:08\
These continual labors produced\
great joy in Alma,\
6:13\
even in trials and troubles\
of every kind.\
6:16\
You see, the Lord loves effort,\
6:19\
and effort focused in\
Him brings blessing.\
6:23\
Even severe trials can be swallowed\
up in the joy of Christ.\
6:28\
Another group in the Book of Mormon who\
made Jesus Christ\
6:36\
and His gospel the focus of their lives\
and found joy are those who founded\
6:42\
the city Helam—\
6:45\
a place where they could raise\
their children and enjoy\
6:49\
the free exercise of religion.\
6:52\
This righteous people living good lives\
were enslaved by a marauding\
6:59\
group, and stripped of the fundamental\
rights to exercise religion.\
7:05\
Sometimes bad things do\
happen to good people:\
7:10\
“The Lord sees fit to test\
His people; yea,\
7:15\
he trieth their patience\
and their faith.\
7:17\
Nevertheless—whosoever putteth\
his trust in [the Lord],\
7:22\
the same shall be lifted up at the\
last day. Yea, and thus it was\
7:29\
[the same] with these people.”\
How did the Lord—\
7:34\
How did these people endure through\
their trials and suffering?\
7:39\
By focusing on Christ and His gospel.\
Their troubles did not define them.\
7:45\
Rather, each of them turned to God,\
7:49\
likely defining themselves as a child\
of God, a child of the covenant,\
7:54\
and a disciple of Jesus Christ.\
8:03\
As they remembered who they\
were and called upon God,\
8:08\
they received peace, strength,\
and ultimately joy in Christ.\
8:13\
“Alma and his people\
8:16\
did ... pour out their hearts to [God];\
8:18\
and he did know the thoughts [and\
intents] of their hearts.\
8:21\
And it came to pass that the voice\
of the Lord came to them in\
8:25\
the afflictions, saying: Lift up your\
heads and be of good [cheer],\
8:28\
for I know of the covenant which\
8:32\
ye have made unto me; and I\
will covenant with my people\
8:36\
and deliver them out of bondage.”\
8:38\
In response the Lord did “ease the\
burdens ... upon [their] shoulders. ...\
8:43\
Yea, the Lord did strengthen them\
8:45\
that they did bear up their\
burdens with ease,\
8:48\
and they did submit cheerfully\
8:52\
and with patience to all the will of the\
Lord.” Note that these Saints let\
8:58\
their troubles, suffering, and trials to\
be swallowed up in the joy of Christ.\
9:04\
Then in due time He showed Alma the\
way for their escape. And Alma,\
9:10\
a prophet of God, led them.\
9:13\
As we focus on Christ and follow His\
prophet, we will be led to Christ\
9:19\
and the joy of His gospel. President\
Nelson has taught,\
9:24\
“Joy is powerful, and focusing on\
9:27\
on joy brings God's power\
into our lives.\
9:30\
As in all things, Jesus Christ\
is our ultimate exemplar,\
9:34\
’who, for the joy that was set before\
him endured the cross.’”\
9:39\
My mother recently passed away.\
It was a shock.\
9:43\
I loved my mother and did not\
plan on losing her so young.\
9:47\
But through her passing, my family and\
I have experienced sorrow and joy.\
9:54\
I know because of Him she is not dead.\
9:57\
She lives and I know because of Christ,\
10:00\
that the priesthood\
keys that have been restored to\
10:04\
the Prophet Joseph Smith, I\
will be with her again.\
10:09\
The sorrow of losing my mom has been\
swallowed up in the joy of Christ.\
10:13\
I am learning that to think celestial\
10:17\
and let God prevail includes focusing\
on the joy available in Christ.\
10:24\
He lovingly invites, “Come unto me, all\
ye that labour and are heavy laden,\
10:31\
and I will give you rest.” In the\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
