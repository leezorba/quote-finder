Elder Stevenson, this is a conference\
never to be forgotten.\
0:06\
Our family has always enjoyed a little\
book called “Children’s Letters to God.”\
0:11\
Here are a few. “Dear God,\
0:14\
instead of letting people die\
and having to make new ones,\
0:18\
why don’t you just keep the\
ones you’ve got right now?”\
0:24\
“How come you only have 10 rules?\
Our school has millions.”\
0:31\
“Why did you put the tonsils in\
0:34\
if you’re just going to\
take them out again?”\
0:39\
Today there isn't time to answer\
all these questions.\
0:43\
But there is another question I often\
hear from young people that\
0:47\
I would like to address. From\
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, to Thomas, Idaho,\
0:52\
the question is the same: “Why?\
0:57\
Why must Latter-day Saints live\
so differently from others?”\
1:02\
I know it's hard to be different,\
1:04\
especially when you are young and want\
so badly for other people to like you.\
1:09\
Everyone wants to fit in and that\
desire is magnified to unhealthy\
1:15\
proportions in today’s digital world\
1:17\
filled with social media\
and cyberbullying.\
1:21\
So with all that pressure, why do\
Latter-day Saints live so differently?\
1:26\
There are many good answers. Because\
you are a child of God.\
1:30\
Because you have been saved\
for the last days.\
1:32\
Because you are a disciple\
of Jesus Christ.\
1:36\
But those answers don't always set you\
apart. Everyone is a child of God.\
1:43\
Everyone on earth right now was\
sent here in the latter days,\
1:47\
and yet not everyone lives the Word\
of Wisdom or law of chastity\
1:51\
the way you strive to. There are many\
valiant disciples of Christ who are\
1:56\
not members of this Church,\
1:58\
but they do not serve missions and\
perform ordinances in houses of\
2:03\
the Lord on behalf of ancestors\
like you do.\
2:06\
There must be more to it, and there is.\
2:11\
Today, I would like to focus on\
2:13\
an additional reason that has\
been meaningful in my life.\
2:17\
In 1988, a young apostle named\
Russell M. Nelson gave\
2:23\
an address at Brigham Young University\
called “Thanks for the Covenant.”\
2:28\
In it then-Elder Nelson explained that\
when we use our moral agency to make\
2:35\
and keep covenants with God,\
2:37\
we become heirs of the everlasting\
covenant God has made with our\
2:42\
forebearers in every dispensation.\
2:45\
Said another way, we become “children of\
the covenant.” That sets us apart,\
2:55\
that gives us access to the same\
blessings our forefathers\
2:59\
and foremothers received, including\
a birthright. “Birthright.”\
3:05\
You may have heard that word.\
We even sing hymns about it:\
3:10\
“O youth of the noble birthright,\
carry on, carry on, carry on.”\
3:15\
It’s a compelling word, but what does\
it mean? In Old Testament times,\
3:22\
if a father passed away, his birthright\
son was responsible for\
3:26\
the care of his mother and sisters.\
3:28\
His brothers received their inheritance\
and left to make their way in\
3:32\
the world. But the birthright\
son did not go anywhere.\
3:36\
He would marry and have his own family,\
3:38\
but he would stay until the\
end of his days to govern\
3:42\
the affairs of his father’s estate.\
Because of this added responsibility,\
3:49\
he was given an added measure\
of the inheritance.\
3:53\
Was leading and caring for\
others too much to ask?\
3:58\
Not when you consider the additional\
inheritance he was given.\
4:03\
Today we are not talking about our\
birth order in earthly families\
4:08\
or Old Testament gender roles.\
4:11\
We are talking about the inheritance you\
receive as a joint heir with Christ.\
4:19\
Because of the covenant relationship\
4:21\
you have chosen to enter with Him\
and your Father in Heaven,\
4:25\
is it too much for God to expect you\
to live differently than His other\
4:31\
children, so you can better\
lead and serve them?\
4:34\
Not when you consider the blessings,\
both temporal and spiritual,\
4:40\
that you have been given.\
4:42\
Does your birthright mean you\
are better than others? No.\
4:47\
But it does mean you are expected\
to help others be better.\
4:52\
Does your birthright mean\
you are chosen?\
4:55\
Yes. But not chosen to rule over others.\
You are chosen to serve them.\
5:02\
Is your birthright evidence\
of God's love? Yes.\
5:07\
But more important, it is\
evidence of His trust.\
5:13\
It is one thing to be loved,\
5:16\
and another thing entirely\
to be trusted.\
5:21\
In the For the Strength of\
Youth guide, we read,\
5:27\
“Your Father in Heaven trusts you.\
5:30\
He has given you great blessings,\
5:33\
including the fulness of the\
gospel and sacred ordinances\
5:37\
and covenants that bind you to Him and\
bring His power into your life.\
5:42\
With those blessings comes\
added responsibility.\
5:46\
He knows you can make a difference\
in the world, and that requires,\
5:50\
in many cases, being different\
from the world.”\
5:57\
Our mortal experience could be\
compared to a cruise ship\
6:01\
on which God has sent all His children\
6:04\
as they journey from one\
shore to another.\
6:07\
The voyage is filled with opportunities\
to learn, grow, be happy, and progress,\
6:13\
but it is also full of dangers.\
6:16\
God loves all His children and is\
concerned about their welfare.\
6:21\
He does not want to lose any of them,\
6:23\
so He invites those who are willing\
to become members of His crew.\
6:29\
That's you. Because of your choice\
to make and keep covenants,\
6:37\
He offers you His trust. He trusts\
you to be different,\
6:43\
peculiar, and set apart because of the\
important work He trusts you to do.\
6:51\
Think of it. Of all the people\
on the earth, God trusts you,\
6:59\
the children of the covenant,\
7:02\
His crew members, to help with His work\
of bringing all His children safely\
7:10\
home to Him. No wonder President\
Brigham Young once said,\
7:14\
“All the angels in heaven are looking\
at this little handful of people.”\
7:24\
When you look around on this\
cruise ship called Earth,\
7:28\
you might see other people sitting\
in lounge chairs, drinking,\
7:32\
gambling in casinos, wearing clothing\
that is too revealing,\
7:38\
scrolling endlessly on cell phones,\
7:40\
and wasting too much time playing\
electronic games.\
7:46\
But instead of wondering,\
“Why can’t I do that?”\
7:50\
you can remember that you are\
not an ordinary passenger;\
7:55\
you are a member of the crew.\
7:58\
You have responsibilities that\
passengers do not have.\
8:03\
As Sister Ardeth Kapp once said,\
8:05\
“You can’t be a life[guard] if you look\
like all the other swimmers on\
8:11\
the beach.” And before you become\
discouraged by all\
8:17\
the extra obligations, please remember\
that crew members receive something\
8:22\
that other passengers\
do not: compensation.\
8:26\
Elder Neil L. Andersen has said, “There\
is a compensatory spiritual power\
8:32\
for the righteous, including greater\
assurance, greater confirmation,\
8:38\
and greater confidence.”\
Like Abraham of old,\
8:42\
you receive greater happiness and peace,\
8:45\
greater righteousness and\
greater knowledge.\
8:50\
Your compensation is not merely\
a mansion in heaven\
8:53\
and streets paved with gold.\
8:56\
It would be easy for Heavenly Father\
to simply give you all that He has.\
9:02\
His desire is to help you\
become all that He is.\
9:08\
Thus, your commitments\
demand more of you\
9:14\
because that is how God\
is making more of you.\
9:22\
It’s a lot to ask of anyone, but\
you are not just anyone!\
9:29\
You are youth of the noble birthright.\
9:37\
Your covenant relationship with\
God and Jesus Christ is\
9:42\
a relationship of love and trust,\
9:46\
in which you have access to a greater\
measure of Their grace,\
9:50\
Their divine assistance, endowment\
of strength, and enabling power.\
9:57\
That power is not just wishful thinking,\
10:00\
a lucky charm, or self-fulfilling\
prophecy. It is real.\
10:07\
As you fulfill your birthright\
responsibilities, you are never alone.\
10:12\
The Lord of the vineyard\
labors with you.\
10:16\
You are working hand in hand with Jesus\
Christ. With each new covenant—\
10:24\
and as your relationship\
with Him deepens—\
10:28\
you hold each other tighter\
10:32\
and tighter until you are firmly clasped\
together. In that sacred symbol\
10:41\
of His grace, you will find\
both the desire and\
10:48\
the strength to live exactly how\
the Savior lived—differently\
10:57\
from the world. You've got this\
11:04\
because Jesus Christ has got you!\
11:10\
In 2 Nephi 2:6 we read,\
11:13\
“Wherefore, redemption cometh in\
and through the Holy Messiah;\
11:16\
for he is full of grace and truth.”\
Because He is full of truth,\
11:21\
He sees you as you really are—\
11:23\
flaws, weaknesses, regrets, and all.\
Because He is full of grace,\
11:28\
He sees you as you really can be.\
11:30\
He meets you where you are and\
helps you repent and improve,\
11:35\
overcome, and become. “O youth\
of the noble birthright,\
11:41\
carry on, carry on, carry on.”\
11:44\
I testify that you are loved\
and you are trusted\
11:49\
today, in 20 years, and forever.\
11:54\
Don't sell your birthright\
for a mess of pottage.\
11:59\
Don’t trade everything for nothing.\
Don’t let the world change you\
12:08\
when you were born to change the world.\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
