Our recent Gong family reunion included\
a fun talent show complete with\
0:07\
a dad jokes contest. But this\
contest was unusual.\
0:12\
On one team was grandpa (me) and two of\
the grandchildren, ages 12 and 11.\
0:19\
On the other team was an artificial\
intelligence (AI) program,\
0:25\
prompted by a cousin to tell dad jokes\
in the style of Gerrit W. Gong.\
0:34\
Grandpa Gerrit Gong versus\
AI Gerrit Gong.\
0:40\
The grandchildren and I went first.\
0:42\
What do you call a dinosaur who crashes\
his car? Tyrannosaurus wrecks.\
0:52\
AI Gerrit Gong was instructed to\
think like Gerrit W. Gong, talk like\
0:56\
him. AI Garrett Gong quote:\
1:00\
“Here is a dad joke of his spoken by\
Gerrit W. Gong, embracing his warm,\
1:06\
thoughtful, and uplifting style.\
1:11\
Why did the humble tree\
make people smile?\
1:15\
Because it was rooted in love\
1:18\
and reached out with branches\
of kindness. Like that tree, we\
1:22\
too can find strength in our roots and\
joy in extending kindness to others.”\
1:29\
End quote.\
1:32\
Well, what do you think? That’s\
why they’re called dad jokes. All\
1:39\
around us are opportunities to laugh,\
delight, see with grateful eyes.\
1:45\
Ours is a gospel of joy and\
holiness in everyday life.\
1:51\
Holiness sets things apart\
for sacred purpose.\
1:55\
But holiness also invites us to infuse\
daily living with the sacred—\
2:01\
to rejoice in daily bread amidst this\
world's thistles and thorns,\
2:07\
to walk with the Lord.\
We must become holy,\
2:11\
for He is holy; and to\
help us become holy,\
2:16\
the Lord invites us to walk with Him.\
We each have a story.\
2:22\
As Sister Gong and I meet you—\
2:24\
Church members and friends in many\
places and circumstances—\
2:28\
your stories of holiness to the Lord in\
everyday life inspire us. You live\
2:34\
seven Cs: communion with God,\
community and\
2:37\
compassion with each other,\
commitment and covenant with God,\
2:43\
family, and friends centered\
in Jesus Christ.\
2:48\
Growing evidence highlights\
this striking fact:\
2:52\
religious believers are,\
on average, happier,\
2:55\
healthier, and more fulfilled than those\
without spiritual commitment\
3:00\
or connection. Happiness\
and life satisfaction,\
3:04\
mental and physical health, meaning\
and purpose, character and virtue,\
3:09\
close social relationships,\
3:12\
even financial and material\
stability—on each measure,\
3:17\
religious practitioners flourish.\
3:20\
They enjoy better physical\
and mental health\
3:23\
and greater life satisfaction across\
all ages and demographic groups.\
3:29\
What researchers call “religious\
structural stability” offers clarity,\
3:35\
purpose, and inspiration amidst\
life’s twists and turns.\
3:39\
The household of faith and community\
of Saints combat\
3:43\
isolation and the lonely crowd.\
3:47\
Holiness to the Lord says “no” to\
the profane, “no” to snarky\
3:53\
cleverness at others’ expense,\
3:55\
“no” to algorithms that monetize\
anger or polarization.\
4:01\
Holiness to the Lord says “yes”\
to the sacred and reverent,\
4:06\
“yes” to our becoming our freest,\
happiest, most authentic,\
4:11\
best selves as we follow Him in faith.\
4:15\
What does holiness to the Lord\
in everyday life look like?\
4:19\
Holiness to the Lord in everyday life\
looks like two faithful young adults\
4:23\
married for a year, sharing\
with authenticity\
4:27\
and vulnerability gospel covenants,\
4:29\
sacrifice, and service in their\
unfolding lives. She begins,\
4:34\
quote, “In high school, I\
was in a dark place.\
4:38\
I felt like God wasn't there for me.\
4:41\
One night, a text from a friend said,\
‘Hey, have you read Alma 36 ever?’\
4:46\
As I started reading,” she said, “I was\
overcome with peace and love.\
4:51\
I felt like I was being given this big\
hug. When I read Alma chapter 36,\
4:57\
verse 12, I knew Heavenly Father saw me\
and knew exactly how I was feeling.”\
5:05\
She continues, “Before we got married,\
5:08\
I was honest with my fiancé\
that I didn't have\
5:11\
a great testimony of tithing.\
5:13\
Why did God need us to give money\
when others had so much to give?\
5:18\
My fiancé helped explain\
it’s not about money,\
5:21\
but following a commandment\
asked of us. He\
5:24\
challenged me to start paying  tithing.\
I really saw my testimony grow.”\
5:30\
She says, “Sometimes money gets tight,\
5:32\
but we saw so many blessings and\
somehow paychecks were enough.\
5:38\
Also, in my nursing class,” she said,\
5:41\
“I was the only member of the Church\
and the only one married.\
5:45\
Many times I left class frustrated\
or crying because\
5:49\
I felt classmates singled me out\
5:51\
and made negative comments about my\
beliefs, my wearing my garments,\
5:56\
or my being married so young.\
5:59\
Yet,” she continues,\
“this past semester,\
6:02\
I learned how to better voice my beliefs\
and be a good gospel example.\
6:07\
My knowledge and testimony grew because\
6:10\
I was tested in my ability to stand\
alone and be strong in what I believe.”\
6:16\
End quote. The young husband adds,\
quote,\
6:20\
“Before my mission, I had offers\
to play college baseball.\
6:24\
Making the difficult decision,\
6:26\
I put those offers aside and\
went to serve the Lord.\
6:29\
I wouldn't trade those two\
years for anything.\
6:33\
Returning home,” he said, “I expected\
a difficult transition,\
6:37\
but found myself stronger,\
6:40\
faster, and healthier I was throwing\
harder than when I left.\
6:44\
I had more offers to play than when\
I left, including my dream school.\
6:49\
And most importantly,” he said, “I rely\
upon the Lord more than ever.”\
6:55\
He concludes, “As a missionary,\
6:58\
I taught that Heavenly Father promises\
us power in our prayers.\
7:02\
But sometimes I forget that\
for myself.” End quote.\
7:08\
Our treasury of missionary holiness-to-\
the-Lord blessings is rich and full.\
7:14\
Finances, timing, and other\
circumstances are often not easy.\
7:18\
But when missionaries of all ages and\
backgrounds consecrate holiness to\
7:22\
the Lord, things can work out\
in the Lord's time and way.\
7:27\
Now, with the 48-year perspective, a\
senior missionary shares, quote,\
7:32\
“My dad wanted me to get a college\
education, not go on a mission.\
7:37\
Shortly after that, he had a heart\
attack and died at age 47.\
7:41\
I felt guilty. How could I make\
things right with my father?\
7:46\
Later,” he continues, “after I\
decided to serve a mission,\
7:50\
I saw my father in a dream\
peaceful and contented.\
7:54\
He was happy I would serve.”\
7:57\
This senior missionary\
continues, “As Doctrine\
8:00\
and Covenants section 138 teaches,\
8:03\
I believe my father could serve as\
a missionary in the spirit world.\
8:08\
I picture my father helping\
our great grandfather,\
8:11\
who left Germany at age 17 and was lost\
to the family, be found again,”\
8:17\
end quote. His wife adds,\
8:19\
“Among the five brothers in\
my husband’s family,\
8:23\
the four who served missions are\
the ones with college degrees.”\
8:27\
End quote. Holiness to the Lord\
in everyday life looks like\
8:31\
a young returning missionary who learned\
to let God prevail in his life.\
8:36\
Earlier, when asked to bless\
someone who was very sick,\
8:39\
this missionary said, “I have faith.\
I’ll bless him to recover.\
8:44\
Yet,” the returning missionary says,\
“I learned in that moment to pray\
8:50\
not for what I wanted, but for what the\
Lord knew the person needed.\
8:55\
I blessed the brother with\
peace and comfort.\
8:57\
He later passed away peacefully.”\
End quote.\
9:01\
Holiness to the Lord in everyday life\
looks like a spark arcing across\
9:06\
the veil to connect, comfort,\
and strengthen.\
9:10\
An administrator in a major university\
says he feels individuals he knows\
9:14\
only by reputation praying for him.\
9:17\
Those individuals devoted their\
life to the university\
9:21\
and continue to care about\
its mission and students.\
9:26\
A sister does her best each day after\
her husband was unfaithful to her\
9:32\
and the children. I deeply admire\
her and others like her.\
9:38\
One day, while folding laundry,\
9:41\
her hand on a stack of garments, she\
sighed to herself. “What’s the point?”\
9:48\
She felt a tender voice assure her,\
“Your covenants are with me.”\
9:56\
For 50 years another sister yearned\
for a relationship with her father.\
10:01\
“Growing up,” she says, “there were\
my brothers and my dad.\
10:05\
And then there was me,\
the only daughter.\
10:08\
All I ever wanted was to be good enough\
for my dad. Then my mom passed away.\
10:15\
She was my only liaison\
between my dad and me.\
10:18\
One day,” the sister said,\
“I heard a voice say,\
10:22\
’invite your dad and take him\
to the temple with you.′\
10:26\
That was the beginning of a twice-\
a-month date with my daddy to\
10:31\
the house of the Lord. I told my dad I\
loved him. He told me he loved me too.\
10:39\
Spending time in the house of\
the Lord has healed us.\
10:43\
My mother could not help us on earth.\
10:46\
It took her being on the other side of\
the veil to help mend what was broken.\
10:51\
The temple completed our journey to\
wholeness as an eternal family.”\
10:57\
End quote. The father says,\
“The temple dedication was\
11:02\
a great spiritual experience for\
me and my only daughter.\
11:06\
Now we attend together and feel our\
love strengthened.” End quote.\
11:12\
Holiness to the Lord in everyday life\
includes tender moments when loved ones\
11:17\
pass. Earlier this year, my dear\
mother, Jean Gong, slipped into\
11:23\
the next life days before\
her 98th birthday.\
11:27\
If you asked my mother, would you like\
11:30\
rocky road, white chocolate, ginger, or\
strawberry ice cream, mom would say,\
11:36\
“Yes, please. May I taste each one?”\
Who could say no to your mother,\
11:42\
especially when she loved\
all of life’s flavors?\
11:47\
I once asked mom which decisions\
had most shaped her life. She\
11:51\
said, “Being baptized a member of The\
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\
11:56\
Saints and moving from Hawaii to the\
mainland, where I met your father.”\
12:02\
Baptized as a 15-year-old,\
12:04\
the only member of her large\
family to join our Church,\
12:08\
my mother had covenant faith and trust\
in the Lord that blessed her life\
12:13\
and all our family generations.\
12:20\
I miss my mother as you miss\
members in your family,\
12:26\
but I know my mother is not gone.\
She's just not here now.\
12:31\
I honor her and all who pass\
12:35\
as valiant examples of everyday\
holiness to the Lord.\
12:41\
Of course, holiness to the Lord in\
everyday life includes coming more\
12:44\
often to the Lord in His holy house.\
12:47\
This is true whether we are\
Church members or friends.\
12:51\
Three friends came to the Bangkok\
Thailand Temple open house.\
12:56\
“This is a place of super healing,”\
said one. In the baptistry,\
13:01\
another said, “When I’m here, I want to\
be washed clean and never sin again.”\
13:08\
The third said, “Can you feel\
13:11\
the spiritual power?” With\
nine sacred words\
13:16\
our temples invite and proclaim\
holiness to the Lord,\
13:21\
the house of the Lord. Holiness to the\
Lord makes daily living sacred.\
13:27\
It draws us closer and happier\
to the Lord and each other,\
13:31\
and prepares us to live with God\
our Father, Jesus Christ,\
13:35\
and our loved ones. As did my friend,\
13:39\
you may wonder if your Heavenly\
Father loves you.\
13:43\
The answer is a resounding,\
absolute yes.\
13:48\
We can feel His love as we make\
holiness to the Lord\
13:52\
ours each day, happy and forever.\
May we do so\
13:57\
I pray in the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
