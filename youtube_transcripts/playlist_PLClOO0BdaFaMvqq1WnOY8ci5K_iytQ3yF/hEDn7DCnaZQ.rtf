About 10 years ago, I felt impressed\
to paint a portrait of the Savior.\
0:07\
Though I'm an artist, this\
felt a bit overwhelming.\
0:10\
How was I to paint a portrait of Jesus\
Christ that captured His spirit?\
0:17\
Where was I to begin and where\
would I find the time?\
0:22\
Even with my questions, I decided\
to move forward and trust that\
0:25\
the Lord would help me. But I\
had to keep moving and leave\
0:29\
the possibilities to Him.\
0:31\
I prayed, pondered, researched,\
and sketched\
0:35\
and was blessed to find\
help and resources.\
0:38\
And what was a white canvas started\
to become something more.\
0:44\
The process wasn't easy. Sometimes\
it didn't look as I had hoped.\
0:48\
Sometimes there were moments of\
inspired strokes and ideas,\
0:52\
and many times I just had to try\
again and again and again.\
0:58\
When I thought the oil painting\
was finally complete and dry,\
1:01\
I began to apply a transparent,\
1:03\
transparent varnish to protect\
it from dirt and dust.\
1:07\
As I did, I noticed the hair in\
the painting start to change,\
1:11\
smear, and dissolve. I quickly\
realized that I had applied\
1:16\
the varnish too soon. That part\
of the painting was still wet.\
1:21\
I had literally wiped away a portion\
of my painting with the varnish.\
1:25\
Oh, how my heart sank. I felt as though\
1:29\
I had just destroyed what\
God had helped me to do.\
1:33\
I cried and felt sick inside,\
and in despair,\
1:39\
I did what anyone would typically\
do in a situation like this:\
1:42\
I called my mother. She wisely\
and calmly said,\
1:49\
“You won’t get back what you had,\
1:52\
but do the very best you can\
with what you’ve got.”\
1:56\
So I prayed and plead for\
help and painted through\
1:59\
the night to repair things. I remember\
looking at the painting in the morning.\
2:04\
It looked better than it did before.\
How is that possible?\
2:10\
What I thought was a mistake without\
mend was an opportunity\
2:14\
for His merciful hand to be manifest.\
2:17\
He was not done with the painting,\
and He was not done with me.\
2:22\
What joy and relief filled my heart.\
I praise the Lord for His mercy,\
2:27\
for this miracle that not\
only saved the painting,\
2:30\
but taught me more about His love\
2:32\
and power to save each of us from our\
weaknesses, mistakes, and sins,\
2:37\
and to help us to become something more.\
2:41\
Just as the depth of my gratitude\
for the Savior grew\
2:44\
as He mercifully helped me to repair\
the unrepairable painting,\
2:48\
so has my personal love and gratitude\
for my Savior intensified as\
2:52\
I have sought to work with\
Him on my weaknesses\
2:55\
and to be forgiven of my mistakes.\
2:59\
I will forever be grateful to my Savior\
that I can change and be cleansed.\
3:05\
He has my heart and I hope to do\
whatever He would have me do\
3:10\
and become. Repenting allows us\
to feel God's love and to know\
3:16\
and love Him in ways we would\
never otherwise know.\
3:19\
Of the woman who anointed the Savior’s\
feet He said, “Her sins,\
3:23\
which are many, are forgiven;\
for she loved much:\
3:28\
but to whom little is forgiven,\
the same loveth little.”\
3:33\
She loved Jesus much, for He\
had forgiven her much.\
3:38\
There is such relief and hope in knowing\
that we can try again, that,\
3:44\
as Elder Bednar taught, we can receive\
3:46\
an ongoing remission of our sins through\
the sanctifying power of\
3:50\
the Holy Ghost as we truly\
and sincerely repent.\
3:55\
The redeeming power of Jesus\
Christ is one of\
3:57\
the greatest promised blessings\
of our covenants.\
4:00\
Ponder this as you participate in\
sacred ordinances. Without it,\
4:05\
we could not return home to the presence\
of our Father in Heaven\
4:09\
and those we love. I know that\
our Lord and Savior,\
4:13\
Jesus Christ, is mighty to save.\
4:16\
As the Son of God, who atoned\
for the sins of the world\
4:19\
and laid down His own life\
and took it up again,\
4:22\
He holds the power of redemption\
and resurrection.\
4:26\
He has made possible immortality\
for all and eternal life\
4:30\
for those who choose Him.\
4:32\
I know that through His atoning\
sacrifice we can repent\
4:36\
and truly be cleansed and redeemed.\
It is a miracle\
4:41\
He loves you and me in this way.\
4:44\
He has said, “Will ye not now return\
unto me, and repent of your sins,\
4:49\
and be converted, that I may heal you?”\
4:53\
He can heal the “waste places” of your\
soul—the places made dry, harsh,\
4:57\
and desolate by sin and sorrow—and\
“make [your] wilderness like Eden.”\
5:04\
Just as we cannot comprehend the agony\
5:06\
and depth of Christ's suffering in\
Gethsemane and on the cross,\
5:09\
so we cannot measure the\
bounds nor fathom\
5:12\
the depths of His divine forgiveness,\
mercy, and love.\
5:18\
You may feel at times that it’s not\
possible to be redeemed, that\
5:21\
perhaps you are an exception\
to God’s love and\
5:25\
the atoning power of Jesus Christ\
5:26\
because of what you are struggling with,\
or because of what you’ve done.\
5:30\
But I testify that you are not\
beneath the Master’s reach.\
5:34\
The Savior descended below\
all things and is in\
5:37\
a divine position to lift you and\
claim you from the darkest abyss\
5:42\
and bring you into His marvelous light.\
5:46\
Through His sufferings,\
He has made a way\
5:48\
for each of us to overcome our\
personal weaknesses and sins.\
5:53\
“He has all power to save every man\
that believeth on His name\
5:57\
and bringeth forth fruit\
5:59\
meet for repentance.” Just as it\
required work and pleading\
6:04\
for heaven’s help to repair\
the painting,\
6:06\
it takes work, sincerity of heart, and\
humility to “bring forth fruit\
6:12\
meet for repentance.” These fruits\
include exercising our faith\
6:16\
and trust in Jesus Christ and\
His atoning sacrifice,\
6:20\
offering to God a broken heart\
and a contrite spirit,\
6:25\
confessing and forsaking sin,\
6:27\
restoring that which is damaged\
to the best of our ability,\
6:31\
and striving to live righteously.\
6:35\
To truly repent and change, we must\
first be convinced of our sins.\
6:40\
A person does not see the need to take\
medicine unless they understand that\
6:44\
they are ill. There may be times we may\
not be willing to look inside ourselves\
6:49\
and see that which really needs healing\
and repair. In C.S. Lewis’s writings,\
6:55\
Aslan poses these words to\
6:57\
a man that has entangled himself\
in his own devices:\
7:01\
“Oh, [humankind], how cleverly you\
defend yourselves from all that might do\
7:06\
you good.” Where might you and\
7:09\
I be defending ourselves from those\
things that might do us good?\
7:14\
Let us not defend ourselves from\
7:16\
the good that God desires\
to bless us with,\
7:19\
from the love and mercy that He desires\
us to feel, from the light\
7:23\
and knowledge He desires\
to bestow upon us,\
7:26\
from the healing that He knows\
we so readily need,\
7:29\
from the deeper covenant relationship\
He intends for all His sons\
7:34\
and daughters. I pray we may lay aside\
any “weapons of war” that we have\
7:40\
consciously or even unconsciously\
7:42\
taken up to defend ourselves from\
the blessings of God's love.\
7:47\
Weapons of pride, selfishness, fear,\
hate, offense, complacency,\
7:55\
unrighteous judgment, jealousies—\
7:58\
anything that would keep us from\
loving God with all our hearts\
8:03\
and keeping all our covenants with Him.\
8:07\
As we live our covenants,\
8:09\
the Lord can give us the help and\
power we need to both recognize\
8:12\
and overcome our weaknesses, including\
the spiritual parasite of pride.\
8:17\
Our prophet has said, “Repentance\
is the pathway to purity, and\
8:21\
purity brings power.” “And oh, how we\
will need his power in the days ahead.”\
8:29\
Like my painting, the Lord is not done\
with us when we make a mistake,\
8:35\
nor does He flee when we falter.\
8:38\
Our need for healing and help\
is not a burden to Him,\
8:41\
but the very reason He came.\
8:44\
The Savior Himself said, “Behold,\
8:46\
I have come unto the world to bring\
redemption unto the world,\
8:50\
to save the world from sin.” “Mine arm\
of mercy is extended towards you,\
8:55\
and whosoever will come,\
him will I receive;\
8:59\
and blessed are those who\
come unto me.” So come—\
9:06\
come ye that are weary, worn, and sad.\
Come and leave your labors\
9:11\
and find rest in Him who loves you most.\
9:15\
Take His yoke upon you, for He\
is gentle and lowly in heart.\
9:21\
Our Heavenly Father and Savior see you.\
They know your heart.\
9:26\
They care about what you care about,\
including those you love.\
9:30\
The Savior can redeem\
that which was lost,\
9:32\
including broken and fractured\
relationships.\
9:35\
He has made way for all that\
has fallen to be redeemed,\
9:38\
to breathe life into that which\
feels dead and hopeless.\
9:43\
If you are struggling with\
9:44\
a situation you think you should have\
overcome by now, don't give up.\
9:49\
Be patient with yourself.\
Keep your covenants.\
9:52\
Repent often. Seek the help\
of your leaders if needed,\
9:56\
and go to the house of the Lord\
as regularly as you can.\
10:00\
Listen for and heed the promptings\
He sends you.\
10:04\
He will not abandon His covenant\
relationship with you.\
10:09\
There have been difficult\
10:10\
and complex relationships in my\
life that I've struggled with\
10:14\
and sincerely sought to improve.\
10:17\
At times I felt like I was failing\
more often than not.\
10:20\
I wondered, did I not fix\
things the last time?\
10:24\
Did I not truly overcome my weakness?\
10:27\
I've learned over time that I'm\
not necessarily defective.\
10:32\
Rather, there is more work to be done\
and more healing that is needed.\
10:39\
Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught,\
10:41\
“Surely the Lord smiles upon one who\
desires to come to judgment worthily,\
10:45\
who resolutely labors day by day to\
replace weakness with strength.\
10:50\
Real repentance, real change may\
require repeated attempts,\
10:55\
but there is something refining\
and holy in such striving.\
11:01\
Divine forgiveness and healing flow\
quite naturally to such a soul.”\
11:07\
Each day is a new day filled\
with hope and possibilities\
11:11\
because of Jesus Christ. Each day\
you and I can come to know,\
11:15\
as mother Eve proclaimed, the\
joy of our redemption,\
11:20\
the joy of being made whole, the joy of\
feeling God’s unfailing love for you.\
11:27\
I know that our Father in Heaven\
and Savior love you.\
11:31\
Jesus Christ is the Savior and\
Redeemer of all mankind.\
11:36\
He lives, and through His\
atoning sacrifice,\
11:39\
the bands of sin and death\
were forever broken\
11:43\
so that we might be free to choose\
healing, redemption,\
11:47\
and eternal life with those we love.\
11:49\
And I testify of these things in His\
name, Jesus Christ, amen.\
