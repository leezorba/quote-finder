On a certain occasion,\
0:03\
the Savior spoke of a merchant man who\
was searching for goodly pearls.\
0:09\
During the merchant man's search,\
he found one of great price.\
0:15\
However, in order to acquire\
the magnificent pearl,\
0:19\
this man had to sell all\
his possessions,\
0:22\
which he promptly and joyfully did.\
0:26\
Through this short and\
thoughtful parable,\
0:29\
the Savior beautifully taught that the\
kingdom of heaven is likened unto\
0:35\
a priceless pearl. Truly the most\
precious treasure that should be\
0:40\
desired over all else. The fact that\
0:44\
the merchant instantly sold all his\
possessions to obtain that valuable\
0:49\
pearl clearly indicates that we should\
align our mind and desires with\
0:55\
the will of the Lord and willingly\
do everything we can during\
0:59\
our mortal journey to attain the eternal\
blessings of God’s kingdom.\
1:05\
To be worthy of this great reward, we\
certainly need, among other things,\
1:11\
to give our best effort to set aside\
all self-centered pursuits\
1:17\
and abandon any entanglement that holds\
us back from full commitment to\
1:22\
the Lord and His higher and holier ways.\
1:26\
The Apostle Paul refers to this\
sanctifying pursuit as “having\
1:31\
the mind of Christ.” As exemplified\
by Jesus Christ,\
1:36\
this means doing always those things\
that please the Lord in our lives.\
1:43\
Or as some people say nowadays, this\
is doing what works for the Lord.\
1:49\
In a gospel sense, doing always\
those things that please\
1:54\
the Lord relates to submitting\
our will to His will.\
1:58\
The Savior thoughtfully taught\
2:01\
the importance of this principle while\
instructing His disciples:\
2:06\
“For I came down from heaven,\
not to do mine own will,\
2:11\
but the will of him that sent me.\
2:15\
And this is the Father’s will which hath\
sent me, that of all which he hath\
2:22\
given me I should lose nothing,\
2:25\
but should raise it up again\
at the last day. And\
2:29\
this is the will of him that sent me,\
that every one which seeth the Son,\
2:37\
and believeth on him, may\
have everlasting life:\
2:41\
and I will raise him\
up at the last day.”\
2:46\
The Savior achieved a perfect and\
divine level of submission to\
2:51\
the Father, by allowing His will to be\
swallowed up in the Father’s will.\
2:56\
He once said, “And he that\
sent me is with me:\
3:02\
the Father hath not left me alone;\
3:05\
for I do always those things\
that please him.”\
3:10\
In teaching the Prophet Joseph Smith\
about the anguish and agonies of\
3:15\
the Atonement, the Savior said,\
“For behold, I God,\
3:20\
have suffered these things\
3:22\
for all, that they might not suffer\
if they would repent; ....\
3:27\
Which suffering caused myself, even God,\
the greatest of all,\
3:37\
to tremble because of pain, and\
to bleed at every pore,\
3:43\
and to suffer both body and spirit—\
3:46\
and would that I might not drink the\
bitter cup and shrink—Nevertheless,\
3:52\
glory be to the Father,\
3:55\
and I partook and finished my\
preparations unto the children of men.”\
4:02\
During our sojourn in mortality,\
4:04\
we often wrestle with what we think\
we know, what we think is best,\
4:10\
and what we assume works for us,\
4:13\
as opposed to comprehending what\
Heavenly Father actually knows,\
4:18\
what is eternally best, and\
what absolutely works\
4:22\
for children within His plan.\
4:25\
This great wrestle can\
become very complex,\
4:29\
especially considering the prophecies\
contained in the scriptures\
4:33\
for our day. “This know also, that in\
4:37\
the last days ... men shall be lovers\
of their own selves, ...\
4:41\
lovers of pleasures more\
than lovers of God.”\
4:46\
One sign that indicates fulfillment\
of this prophecy is\
4:51\
the current growing trend in the world,\
4:54\
adopted by so many, of people becoming\
consumed with themselves\
4:59\
and constantly proclaiming,\
“No matter what,\
5:03\
I live my own truth,” or “I\
do what works for me.”\
5:08\
As Paul the Apostle said,\
they seek their own,\
5:13\
not the things which are Jesus Christ's.\
5:16\
This way of thinking is often justified\
5:19\
as being authentic by those who indulge\
in self-centered pursuits,\
5:25\
personal preferences, or want to\
justify certain types of behavior that\
5:30\
frequently don’t match God’s loving\
plan and His will for them.\
5:36\
If we let our heart and mind embrace\
this way of thinking,\
5:42\
we can create significant stumbling\
blocks for ourselves in acquiring\
5:47\
the most priceless pearl that\
God has lovingly prepared\
5:52\
for His children: eternal life.\
5:55\
While it is true that\
each of us travels\
5:58\
an individualized discipleship\
journey on the covenant path,\
6:02\
striving to keep our hearts and minds\
centered on Jesus Christ,\
6:08\
we need to be careful and\
constantly vigilant,\
6:12\
not to be tempted to adopt this type\
of worldly philosophy in our life.\
6:18\
Elder Quentin L. Cook said that “Being\
sincerely Christlike is\
6:24\
an even more important goal\
than being authentic.”\
6:28\
My dear friends, when we\
choose to let God be\
6:32\
the most powerful influence in our life\
over our self-serving pursuits,\
6:38\
we can make progress\
in our discipleship\
6:41\
and increase our capacity to unite our\
mind and heart with the Savior.\
6:47\
On the other hand, when we don't allow\
God's way to prevail in our life,\
6:53\
we are left to ourselves and we doubt\
the Lord's inspiring guidance.\
6:59\
We can justify almost anything\
we do or don't do.\
7:04\
We can also make excuses for ourselves\
by doing things our own way, saying,\
7:10\
in effect, “I’m just doing\
things my way.”\
7:14\
On one occasion, while the Savior was\
declaring His doctrine, some people,\
7:20\
particularly self-righteous pharisees,\
7:23\
rejected His message and boldly declared\
that they were children of\
7:28\
Abraham, implying that their lineage\
would grant them special privileges in\
7:33\
the sight of God. That mentality\
led them to lean unto their own\
7:38\
understanding and to disbelieve\
what the Savior was teaching.\
7:44\
The pharisees’ reaction to Jesus was\
clear evidence that their presumptuous\
7:51\
attitude left no place in their hearts\
for the Savior's words and God's way.\
7:57\
In response, Jesus wisely\
8:00\
and courageously declared that if they\
were true covenant children of Abraham,\
8:06\
they would do the works of Abraham,\
8:08\
especially considering that the God of\
Abraham was standing before them\
8:14\
and teaching them the truth\
at that very moment.\
8:19\
Brothers and sisters, as you can see,\
8:22\
acting on this mental gymnastics\
of what works\
8:26\
for me versus doing what always\
pleases the Lord\
8:30\
is not a new trend that\
is unique to our day.\
8:34\
It is an age-old mentality that has\
crossed the centuries and often blinds\
8:40\
the wise in their own eyes and\
confuses and exhausts\
8:44\
many of God’s children.\
8:46\
This mentality is in fact an\
old trick of the adversary.\
8:51\
It is a deceptive path that carefully\
leads God's children away from\
8:57\
the true and faithful covenant path.\
9:00\
While personal circumstances such\
as genetics, geography,\
9:05\
and physical and mental challenges do\
influence our journey, in things that\
9:11\
truly matter, there is an inner space\
where we are free to choose whether\
9:16\
or not we will decide to follow the\
pattern that the Lord has prepared\
9:22\
for in our life. Truly, “He marked\
the path and led the way,\
9:30\
and every point defined.”\
As Christ’s disciples,\
9:36\
we desire to walk the\
path that He marked\
9:38\
for us during His mortal ministry.\
9:40\
We not only desire to do His will\
and all that will please Him,\
9:45\
but seek to emulate Him. As we strive to\
be true to every covenant we have\
9:53\
entered into and live by every word that\
proceedeth out of the mouth of God,\
9:59\
we will be protected against falling\
victim to the sins and errors of\
10:05\
the world—errors of philosophy\
10:08\
and doctrine that would lead us away\
from those most precious pearls.\
10:14\
I have been personally\
inspired by how such\
10:19\
a spiritual submissiveness\
to God has impacted\
10:22\
the lives of faithful\
disciples of Christ\
10:25\
as they choose to do those things that\
work for and are pleasing in\
10:31\
the sight of the Lord.\
I know a young man\
10:36\
who was unsettled about\
going on a mission.\
10:39\
He felt inspired to go and serve\
the Lord when he listened to\
10:44\
a senior leader of the Church sharing\
his own personal testimony\
10:48\
and sacred experience of serving\
as a missionary.\
10:52\
In his own words, this young man,\
now a returned missionary, said,\
10:59\
“As I listened to the testimony of an\
apostle of the Savior Jesus Christ,\
11:05\
I was able to feel\
God’s love for me and\
11:09\
I desired to share that\
love with others.\
11:12\
At that very moment, I knew\
that I should serve\
11:16\
a mission despite my fears,\
doubts, and concerns.\
11:21\
I felt totally confident in the\
blessings and promises of God\
11:25\
for His children. Today\
I am a new person.\
11:29\
I have a testimony that this\
gospel is true and that\
11:33\
the Church of Jesus Christ has\
been restored on earth.”\
11:38\
This young man chose the Lord's\
way and became an example of\
11:45\
a true disciple in every aspect.\
11:48\
A faithful young woman decided not to\
compromise her standards when she was\
11:54\
asked to dress Immodestly to fit\
into the business division of\
11:59\
the fashion company where she worked.\
12:02\
Understanding that her body is\
12:05\
a sacred gift from our Heavenly Father\
and a place where the Spirit can dwell,\
12:10\
she was moved to live by a standard\
higher than the world's.\
12:16\
She not only gained the confidence\
of those who saw her living by\
12:20\
the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ,\
but she also preserved her job,\
12:27\
which for a moment was in jeopardy.\
12:31\
Her willingness to do what was\
pleasing in the sight of\
12:34\
the Lord rather than what\
worked for the world,\
12:39\
gave her confidence\
amidst difficult choices.\
12:45\
Brothers and sisters, we are constantly\
confronted by similar decisions in\
12:51\
our daily journey. It takes\
a courageous and\
12:55\
a willing heart to pause and pursue\
an honest and meek introspection,\
13:02\
to acknowledge the presence\
of weaknesses of\
13:05\
the flesh in our life that may impede\
our ability to submit ourselves to God\
13:11\
and ultimately decide to adopt\
His way rather than our own.\
13:19\
The ultimate test of our discipleship\
is found in our willingness to give\
13:25\
up and lose our old self\
13:28\
and submit our heart and our whole soul\
to God so that His will becomes ours.\
13:37\
One of the most glorious moments\
13:43\
of mortality occurs when we discover\
13:47\
the joy that comes when doing always\
those things that work for and please\
13:53\
the Lord and what works for us\
13:56\
become one and the same. To decisively\
and unquestionably make\
14:03\
the Lord's will our own requires\
majestic and heroic discipleship.\
14:09\
At that sublime moment, we become\
consecrated to the Lord,\
14:14\
and we totally yield our wills to Him.\
14:18\
Such spiritual submissiveness, so to\
speak, is beautiful, powerful,\
14:24\
and transformational. I testify\
to you that following\
14:30\
the Lord's will in our life\
will enable us to find\
14:34\
the most precious pearl in the world:\
the kingdom of Heaven.\
14:39\
I pray that each of us,\
in our time and turn,\
14:44\
will be able to declare with covenant\
confidence to our Heavenly Father\
14:49\
and Savior, Jesus Christ,\
that “What works for Thee,\
14:55\
works for me.” I say these things in\
the sacred name of our Savior,\
15:02\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
