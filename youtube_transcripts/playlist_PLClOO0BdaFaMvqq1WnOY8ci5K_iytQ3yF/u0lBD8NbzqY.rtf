What does our Heavenly Father\
desire from you?\
0:05\
Do you understand that when you were\
in your premortal existence,\
0:10\
Heavenly Father was preparing\
you for your life on earth?\
0:15\
Speaking to youth, President\
Russell M. Nelson taught:\
0:18\
“Our Heavenly Father has reserved\
many of His most noble spirits—\
0:22\
perhaps His finest team—\
for this final phase.”\
0:27\
Because we have been reserved\
for these latter days,\
0:30\
it is crucial for us to learn to\
be disciples of Jesus Christ.\
0:35\
The Lord Jesus Christ is the Good\
Shepherd, and He knows His flock,\
0:40\
and the flock knows its Shepherd\
0:42\
because “he calleth his\
own sheep by name.”\
0:45\
He is always calling upon us, and He\
uses us, His ordinary servants,\
0:51\
to help bring His children to Him.\
0:55\
A while ago, a stake president and\
I were visiting members of\
0:59\
the Church in a local neighborhood.\
1:01\
After we finished our scheduled visits,\
1:04\
the stake president asked me if we\
could go see one more family.\
1:09\
He felt impressed that we\
should talk with them.\
1:13\
We knocked on the door and\
a sister opened it.\
1:16\
She looked at me, but she didn't know\
who I was, so she didn't express much.\
1:22\
I pointed my hand towards the stake\
president, who greeted her by name.\
1:28\
As soon as she heard and\
saw him, she rejoiced.\
1:33\
Standing there at the door, they both\
hugged each other and cried together.\
1:39\
This set the tone for our visit.\
1:42\
We didn't know that that sister had\
received chemotherapy the day before.\
1:48\
She felt too weak to care\
for her adult son.\
1:52\
So, I helped the stake president\
dress her son,\
1:57\
and we put him in his wheelchair.\
1:59\
We fed him the food that another\
sweet sister from\
2:03\
the ward had brought earlier,\
2:05\
and we helped with other tasks.\
Before we left their home,\
2:10\
we were able to bless them.\
2:13\
All that was going through my\
mind during this visit was\
2:17\
a confirmation that Jesus Christ\
loves them deeply.\
2:22\
He understands them and\
personally knows\
2:25\
the pain of their unique situation.\
2:29\
Almost the entire visit\
happened in silence.\
2:32\
On this occasion, we did\
not give a big sermon\
2:36\
or share our favorite scripture,\
2:38\
but the Lord blessed us with\
His Spirit abundantly.\
2:43\
One of the greatest reasons your\
Heavenly Father sent you here at this\
2:48\
time is so that you can realize\
your full potential.\
2:51\
Preach My Gospel teaches us that\
as disciples of Christ,\
2:55\
we should avoid comparing ourselves\
to one another.\
2:59\
Your spiritual abilities are unique,\
personal, and innate,\
3:04\
and your Heavenly Father wants\
to help you develop them.\
3:08\
There will always be someone\
you can help\
3:11\
feel the love of your Heavenly Father.\
Your potential is divine.\
3:17\
While it is certainly important to\
prepare yourself to succeed in this\
3:21\
very competitive world, one of your\
crucial missions throughout your life\
3:27\
is to become a disciple of Jesus Christ\
and to follow the impressions of\
3:32\
the Spirit. As you do this,\
God will bless your life,\
3:37\
He will bless your current\
or future family,\
3:41\
and He will bless the lives of His\
children that you encounter.\
3:47\
We live in a time of great opportunity.\
3:50\
Although we face many difficulties,\
3:53\
I know they are there in part to\
allow us to help others feel\
4:01\
the love of our Heavenly Father.\
President Nelson taught,\
4:05\
“In coming days, we will see the\
greatest manifestations of\
4:09\
the Savior’s power that the\
world has ever seen.”\
4:13\
We have the privilege to watch over\
people who need a helping hand,\
4:18\
an embrace, a feeling of comfort,\
4:21\
or simply for us to be\
with them in silence.\
4:25\
If we can help lighten their burdens,\
even if only for a moment,\
4:29\
then we will be able to see the\
great manifestations of\
4:34\
the Savior powers in their lives.\
As disciples of Jesus Christ,\
4:39\
Latter-day Saints can make a positive\
difference in the world.\
4:44\
We can provide a sense of joy\
that is reflected in our countenance—\
4:50\
a joy that we share with words\
of love and acts of kindness.\
4:56\
Let us be good neighbors, good\
employers, good workers.\
5:00\
Let us strive to be good Christians\
at all times.\
5:04\
The Lord has restored His gospel\
with the necessary ordinances\
5:09\
so that Heavenly Father's\
children can have all\
5:12\
the promises that bind us to Him.\
5:16\
By helping our sisters and brothers\
in their daily challenges,\
5:20\
let us also remember to help them make\
5:23\
and keep these sacred promises with\
their Heavenly Father, so that He,\
5:29\
in turn, can promise them the richest\
blessings for this life and\
5:34\
for eternity. These promises are\
only made possible through\
5:39\
the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus\
Christ and His priesthood keys.\
5:44\
In other words, we can help others\
stay on the covenant path.\
5:49\
Some of us deviate from the\
path from time to time,\
5:54\
and so we must remember that\
for our Heavenly Father,\
5:59\
we always have the possibility\
of returning.\
6:03\
Even if the course is not\
the most perfect,\
6:06\
the Savior always remind us,\
6:09\
“as oft as [we repent] and [seek]\
forgiveness, with real intent,\
6:16\
[we will be] forgiven.” One\
of the crafts of\
6:20\
the adversary today is to make us think\
and believe that there is no way\
6:24\
for us to change, or that\
we no longer have hope.\
6:28\
This destructive thinking causes\
many of us to stop trying.\
6:35\
And it is at this moment when our love,\
our words of encouragement and support,\
6:42\
our time, and our help can give someone\
hope enough to try once more.\
6:50\
Maybe you’re thinking, “Okay,\
6:52\
but who ministers to me?” By going and\
blessing the lives of our brothers\
7:00\
and sisters, we will collect\
testimonies that will fill our life\
7:05\
with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.\
7:08\
These testimonies will revitalize\
us to try once more ourselves.\
7:16\
The Holy Spirit will revive us and\
help us with renewed testimonies,\
7:20\
to continue with our own difficulties\
and personal trials.\
7:24\
Whenever we seek to bless\
the lives of others,\
7:27\
the Lord takes mercy upon us even more.\
7:31\
He strengthens us\
and helps us in our lives.\
7:34\
Please remember that the Lord\
Jesus Christ is your Savior\
7:39\
and understands you personally.\
7:41\
He knows what it is to have\
to fulfill a calling\
7:45\
and leave things behind to\
help the children of God.\
7:48\
He has the power to bless you in\
everything, if you believe in Him\
7:54\
and do not doubt. My dear\
brothers and sisters,\
7:59\
on that day when a priesthood leader\
felt impressed for us to visit\
8:03\
a mother and a son that we did\
not have on our agenda,\
8:07\
I proclaim that God knew they\
needed us. And at the end,\
8:14\
I was the one who was ministered.\
8:17\
On that day, I received one\
of the greatest lessons of\
8:22\
the Savior's love for us.\
8:24\
I testify that Jesus Christ is the\
Savior of the world, that He lives,\
8:31\
that He died, lived and\
died for you and me,\
8:36\
and that He was resurrected\
for you and me\
8:39\
so that we can aspire to celestial\
reunions full of joy with those who are\
8:45\
already on the other side of the veil.\
8:49\
I know that He understands\
you and me perfectly.\
8:55\
He understands each of our\
difficult moments,\
8:58\
and He has the power to help us in\
those moments where we feel most\
9:02\
vulnerable. I know that the Lord Jesus\
Christ and our Heavenly Father appeared\
9:07\
to Joseph Smith to restore\
the gospel in these days.\
9:11\
I know that our dear Prophet Russell\
M. Nelson is a prophet of the Lord,\
9:16\
and I testify of this in the name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
