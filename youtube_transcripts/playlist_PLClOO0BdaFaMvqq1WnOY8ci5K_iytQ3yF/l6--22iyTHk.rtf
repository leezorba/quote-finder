My beloved brothers and sisters,\
sitting on the stand today,\
0:06\
I have watched this Conference\
Center fill up three times—\
0:11\
for the first time since covid—\
0:15\
fill up with devoted disciples of Jesus\
Christ who are eager to learn.\
0:22\
I commend you for your faithfulness\
0:26\
and I love you.\
0:32\
Ezra Taft Benson served as\
0:34\
the president of The Church of Jesus\
Christ of Latter-day Saints from\
0:39\
November 1985 until May 1994.\
0:46\
I was 33 years old when President\
Benson became the president of\
0:50\
the Church, and 42 when he passed away.\
0:55\
And his teachings and testimony\
influenced me in that stage of my life\
1:00\
in profound and powerful ways.\
1:04\
One of the hallmarks of President\
Benson's ministry was his focus upon\
1:09\
the purpose and importance\
of the Book of Mormon.\
1:13\
He emphasized repeatedly that\
the Book of Mormon “is\
1:17\
the keystone of our religion—the\
keystone of our testimony,\
1:22\
the keystone of our doctrine,\
1:25\
and the keystone in the witness\
of our Lord and Savior.”\
1:30\
He also often emphasized\
teachings and warnings about\
1:34\
the sin of pride found in this latter-\
day testament of Jesus Christ.\
1:40\
A particular teaching by President\
Benson greatly impacted me\
1:45\
and continues to influence my\
study of the Book of Mormon.\
1:50\
He said, “The Book of Mormon ...\
was written for our day.\
1:56\
The Nephites never had the book;\
1:59\
neither did the Lamanites of ancient\
times. It was meant for us.\
2:05\
Mormon wrote near the end of\
the Nephite civilization.\
2:10\
Under the inspiration of God, who sees\
all things from the beginning,\
2:15\
[Mormon] abridged centuries of records,\
choosing the stories, speeches,\
2:21\
and events that would be\
most helpful to us.”\
2:26\
President Benson continued, “Each\
of the major writers of\
2:31\
the Book of Mormon testified that\
he wrote for future generations. ...\
2:37\
If they saw our day and chose those\
things which would be of greatest worth\
2:43\
to us, is not that how we should\
study the Book of Mormon?\
2:49\
We should constantly ask ourselves,\
2:53\
’Why did the Lord inspire Mormon ... to\
include [this account] in his record?\
2:59\
What lesson can I learn from [this\
admonition] to help me live in this day\
3:05\
and age?’” President Benson’s statements\
help us to understand that\
3:11\
the Book of Mormon is not primarily\
a historical record that looks to\
3:17\
the past. Rather, this volume of\
scripture looks to the future\
3:23\
and contains important principles,\
warnings,\
3:26\
and lessons intended for\
the circumstances\
3:30\
and challenges of our day.\
3:32\
Hence, the Book of Mormon is\
a book about our future and\
3:38\
the times in which we do\
now and will yet live.\
3:43\
I pray for the assistance\
of the Holy Ghost\
3:46\
as we now consider relevant\
lessons for us today\
3:50\
from the Book of Helaman\
in the Book of Mormon.\
3:56\
The record of Helaman and\
his sons describes\
3:59\
a people who were anticipating\
the birth of Jesus Christ.\
4:04\
The half century recounted in the\
scriptural record highlights\
4:09\
the conversion and righteousness of\
the Lamanites and the wickedness,\
4:14\
apostasy, and abominations\
of the Nephites.\
4:20\
A series of comparisons and contrasts\
between the Nephites\
4:24\
and Lamanites from this ancient record\
are most instructive for us today.\
4:31\
“The Lamanites had become, the more\
part of them, a righteous people,\
4:35\
insomuch that their righteousness\
did exceed that of the Nephites,\
4:40\
because of their firmness and their\
steadiness in the faith. [And]\
4:46\
there were many of the Nephites who\
had become hardened and impenitent\
4:51\
and grossly wicked, insomuch that\
they did reject the word of God,\
4:57\
and all the preaching and prophesying\
which did come among them.”\
5:02\
“And thus we see that the Nephites\
did begin to dwindle in unbelief,\
5:08\
and grow in wickedness and abominations,\
5:11\
while the Lamanites began\
to grow exceedingly in\
5:15\
the knowledge of their God;\
5:17\
yea, they did begin to keep his\
statutes and commandments,\
5:21\
and to walk in truth and\
uprightness before him.\
5:26\
And thus we see that the Spirit of\
the Lord began to withdraw from\
5:31\
the Nephites, because of the wickedness\
and the hardness of their hearts.\
5:37\
And thus we see that the Lord began to\
pour out his Spirit upon the Lamanites,\
5:42\
because of their easiness and\
willingness to believe in his words.”\
5:50\
Perhaps the most stunning\
5:53\
and sobering aspect of this decline\
into apostasy by the Nephites is\
5:59\
the fact that “all these iniquities\
did come unto them in\
6:04\
the space of not many years.”\
6:09\
How could a once righteous people become\
hardened and wicked in such\
6:14\
a short period of time? How could\
people so quickly forget the God\
6:19\
who had blessed them so abundantly?”\
6:23\
In a powerful and profound way,\
6:25\
the negative example of the Nephites\
is instructive for us today.\
6:32\
“Pride ... began to enter ...\
into the hearts of\
6:35\
the people who professed to belong\
to the church of God ...\
6:40\
because of their exceedingly great\
riches and their prosperity in the\
6:46\
land.” “[They] set [their] hearts upon\
riches and the vain things of this\
6:52\
world” “because of that pride which\
[they]...suffered to enter into [their]\
6:57\
hearts, which ... lifted [them] up\
beyond that which is good\
7:00\
because of [their]\
exceeding great riches.”\
7:05\
Ancient voices from the dust plead with\
us today to learn this everlasting\
7:12\
lesson: prosperity, possessions,\
and ease constitute\
7:20\
a potent mixture that can lead\
even the righteous to drink\
7:25\
the spiritual poison of pride.\
7:30\
Allowing pride to enter into our hearts\
can cause us to mock that which is\
7:35\
sacred; disbelieve in the spirit\
of prophecy and revelation;\
7:41\
trample under our feet the\
commandments of God;\
7:44\
deny the word of God; cast out, mock,\
and revile against the prophets;\
7:50\
and forget the Lord our God\
7:53\
and “desire not that the Lord [our] God,\
who hath created [us],\
7:58\
should rule and reign over [us].”\
8:02\
Therefore, if we are not\
faithful and obedient,\
8:05\
we can transform the God-given\
blessing of prosperity into\
8:11\
a prideful curse that diverts and\
distracts us from eternal truths\
8:17\
and vital spiritual priorities.\
8:21\
We always must be on guard\
against a pride-induced\
8:26\
and exaggerated sense\
of self-importance,\
8:30\
a misguided evaluation of our\
own self-sufficiency,\
8:35\
and seeking self instead\
of serving others.\
8:40\
As we pridefully focus upon ourselves,\
8:44\
we also are afflicted with spiritual\
blindness and miss much, most,\
8:49\
or perhaps all that is occurring\
within and around us.\
8:54\
We cannot look to and focus\
upon Jesus Christ as\
8:58\
the “mark” if we only see ourselves.\
9:04\
Such spiritual blindness also\
can cause us to turn out of\
9:08\
the way of righteousness, fall\
away into forbidden paths,\
9:13\
and become lost. As we blindly\
“turn unto our own ways”\
9:19\
and follow destructive detours,\
9:22\
we are inclined to lean upon\
our own understanding,\
9:26\
boast in our own strength, and\
depend upon our own wisdom.\
9:33\
Samuel the Lamanite succinctly\
summarized the turning away from God by\
9:37\
the Nephites: “Ye have sought\
all the days of your lives,\
9:43\
for that which ye could not obtain;\
9:46\
and ye have sought for happiness\
in doing iniquity,\
9:49\
which thing is contrary to the\
nature of that righteousness,\
9:54\
which is in our great and Eternal Head.”\
9:58\
The prophet Mormon observed,\
10:00\
“The more part of the people remained\
in their pride and wickedness,\
10:05\
and the lesser part walked more\
circumspectly before God.”\
10:11\
In the book of Helaman, the increasing\
righteousness of the Lamanites provides\
10:17\
a stark contrast to the rapid spiritual\
decline of the Nephites.\
10:22\
The Lamanites turn to God and were\
brought to a knowledge of\
10:26\
the truth by believing the teachings in\
the holy scriptures and of prophets,\
10:32\
exercising faith in the Lord Jesus\
Christ, repenting of their sins,\
10:37\
and experiencing a mighty\
change of heart.\
10:41\
“Therefore, as many as\
have come to this,\
10:44\
ye know of yourselves, are firm\
and steadfast in the faith,\
10:49\
and in the thing wherewith\
they have been made free.”\
10:54\
“Ye should behold that the more\
part of [the Lamanites] are in\
10:57\
the path of their duty, and they do\
walk circumspectly before God,\
11:02\
and they do observe to keep his\
commandments and his statutes\
11:06\
and his judgments.” “They are striving\
with unwearied diligence that they may\
11:13\
bring the remainder of their brethren\
to the knowledge of the truth.”\
11:17\
As a consequence of “the\
righteousness [of the\
11:20\
Lamanites] did exceed that of the\
Nephites because of their firmness\
11:27\
and their steadiness in the faith.”\
11:31\
Moroni declared, “Behold, the Lord\
hath shown unto me great\
11:38\
and marvelous things concerning\
that which must shortly come,\
11:44\
at that day when these things\
shall come forth among you.\
11:48\
Behold, I speak unto you as if you\
were present, and yet ye are not.\
11:56\
But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you\
unto me, and I know your doing.”\
12:03\
Please remember that the Book of\
Mormon looks to the future\
12:07\
and contains important principles,\
warnings,\
12:10\
and lessons intended for me and\
you in the circumstances\
12:15\
and challenges of our present day.\
12:19\
Apostasy can occur at two basic levels:\
institutional and individual.\
12:26\
At the institutional level,\
12:28\
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\
day Saints will not be lost through\
12:34\
apostasy or taken from the earth.\
12:38\
The Prophet Joseph Smith proclaimed,\
“The standard of truth has been erected.\
12:44\
No unhallowed hand can stop\
the work from progressing; ...\
12:50\
the truth of God will go\
forth boldly, nobly,\
12:54\
and independent till it has penetrated\
every continent, visited every clime,\
13:01\
swept every country, and\
sounded in every ear,\
13:05\
till the purposes of God\
shall be accomplished\
13:08\
and the great Jehovah shall say\
the work is done.”\
13:14\
At the individual level, each\
of us must “beware of pride,\
13:21\
lest [we] become as\
the Nephites of old.”\
13:25\
May I suggest that if you or I believe\
we are sufficiently strong\
13:30\
and stalwart to avoid the\
arrogance of pride,\
13:34\
then perhaps we already are suffering\
from this deadly spiritual disease.\
13:40\
Simply stated, if you or I do not\
believe we could be afflicted with\
13:45\
and by pride, then we are vulnerable\
and in spiritual danger.\
13:52\
In the space of not many days, weeks,\
months, or years,\
13:58\
we might forfeit our spiritual\
birthright for far less than\
14:04\
a mess of pottage. If, however,\
14:07\
you or I believe we could be afflicted\
with and by pride,\
14:12\
then we consistently will do the small\
and simple things that will protect\
14:17\
and help us become as “a child,\
submissive, meek, humble, patient,\
14:23\
full of love, willing to submit\
to all things which\
14:27\
the Lord seeth fit to\
inflict upon [us].”\
14:31\
“Blessed are they who humble themselves\
without being compelled to be humble.”\
14:39\
As we follow President Benson's\
counsel and ask ourselves why\
14:44\
the Lord inspired Mormon to include in\
his abridgment of the Book of Helaman\
14:49\
the accounts, admonitions, and\
warnings that he did,\
14:53\
I promise we will discern the\
applicability of these teachings to\
15:00\
the specific conditions of our\
individual lives and families today.\
15:06\
As we study and ponder\
this inspired record,\
15:10\
we will be blessed with eyes to see and\
ears to hear, minds to comprehend,\
15:18\
and hearts to understand\
15:21\
the lessons we should learn\
to “beware of pride,\
15:25\
lest [we] should enter into temptation.”\
15:30\
I joyfully witness that God, the\
Eternal Father, is our Father.\
15:36\
Jesus Christ is His Only Begotten and\
Beloved Son. He is our Savior.\
15:44\
And I testify that as we walk in the\
meekness of the Lord's Spirit,\
15:50\
we will avoid and overcome pride\
and have peace in Him.\
15:56\
I so witness in the sacred name\
of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.\
