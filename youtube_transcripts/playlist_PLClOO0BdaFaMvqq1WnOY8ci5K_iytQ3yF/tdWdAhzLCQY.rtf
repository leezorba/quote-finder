I know this may come as a surprise,\
0:03\
but I'm old enough to remember when we\
were taught in school that there were\
0:07\
nine planets in our solar system.\
0:11\
One of those planets, Pluto, was given\
its name by 11-year-old Venetia Burney\
0:15\
of Oxford, England, after its discovery\
in 1930. And up until 1992,\
0:21\
Pluto was believed to be the most\
distant object in our solar system.\
0:25\
During this time, it was common to find\
childhood papier mâché models of our\
0:29\
planetary neighborhood in classrooms\
and science fairs,\
0:33\
each one illustrating Pluto's position\
on the known border.\
0:37\
Many scientists believed\
that beyond that edge,\
0:40\
the outer solar system consisted\
of empty space.\
0:43\
However, a lingering question\
remained within\
0:46\
the scientific community\
regarding the origin of\
0:49\
a particular type of comet that\
astronomers regularly tracked.\
0:53\
And that question persisted\
for decades before\
0:56\
the discovery of another distant\
region of our solar system.\
1:00\
With the limited knowledge they had,\
1:02\
scientists used those intervening\
decades to produce significant\
1:05\
technological advances that allowed\
for further study and exploration.\
1:10\
Their eventual breakthrough reconfigured\
our planetary zone\
1:14\
and resulted in Pluto being re-homed\
to this new region of space\
1:19\
and our solar system consisting\
of eight planets.\
1:23\
One leading planetary scientist\
and principal investigator for\
1:27\
the New Horizons space mission tasked\
with exploring Pluto up close,\
1:31\
had this to say about this experience:\
1:34\
“We thought we understood the geography\
of our solar system. We didn’t.\
1:39\
We thought we understood the population\
of planets in our solar\
1:42\
system. And we were wrong.”\
1:45\
What's striking to me about this period\
of space exploration history are some\
1:49\
parallels and key distinctions between\
1:51\
the metaphorical pursuit of expanding\
scientific horizons and\
1:55\
the journey that we, as children of God,\
1:58\
undertake to seek answers to our\
spiritual questions, specifically,\
2:03\
how we can respond to the limits\
of our spiritual understanding\
2:07\
and prepare ourselves for the next\
stage of personal growth,\
2:11\
and where we can turn for help.\
2:14\
Asking questions and searching\
for meaning is a natural\
2:17\
and normal part of our\
mortal experience.\
2:20\
At times, not readily having complete\
answers can bring us to\
2:23\
the edge of our understanding,\
2:25\
and those limitations can feel\
frustrating or overwhelming.\
2:29\
Wondrously, Heavenly Father's\
plan of happiness\
2:33\
for all of us is designed to help us\
progress despite our limitations\
2:38\
and accomplish what we cannot\
accomplish on our own,\
2:42\
even without a complete knowledge\
of all things.\
2:45\
God's plan is merciful towards the\
limitations of our humanity,\
2:50\
provides us with our Savior, Jesus\
Christ, to be our Good Shepherd,\
2:55\
and inspires us to use our\
agency to choose Him.\
2:59\
Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf has taught\
that “asking questions isn’t\
3:02\
a sign of weakness,” but rather\
“it’s a precursor of growth.”\
3:06\
Speaking directly to our personal effort\
as seekers of truth, our prophet,\
3:10\
President Russell M. Nelson,\
3:12\
has taught that we must have a “deep\
desire” and “ask with a sincere heart\
3:16\
[and] real intent, having\
faith in [Jesus] Christ.” He\
3:20\
has further taught that “‘real intent’\
means that one really intends to follow\
3:25\
the divine direction given.” Our\
personal effort to grow in wisdom may\
3:30\
lead us to examine our questions,\
complex or otherwise,\
3:34\
through the lens of cause and effect,\
3:36\
seeking out and recognizing patterns\
3:38\
and then forming narratives to give\
shape to our understanding\
3:42\
and fill in perceived gaps in knowledge.\
3:45\
When we consider our pursuit of\
spiritual knowledge, however,\
3:48\
these thoughtful processes\
may be helpful at times,\
3:51\
but on their own can be incomplete\
3:54\
as we look to discern things pertaining\
to Heavenly Father and our Savior,\
3:58\
Jesus Christ; Their gospel; Their\
Church; and Their plan for all of us.\
4:04\
God the Father and His Son’s way\
of imparting Their wisdom to us\
4:08\
prioritizes inviting the power of\
4:11\
the Holy Ghost to be our\
personal teacher\
4:13\
as we center Jesus Christ in our\
lives and in our faithful\
4:17\
seeking for their answers\
and their meaning.\
4:20\
They invite us to discover truth through\
devoted time spent studying\
4:25\
holy scripture and to seek for latter\
day revealed truth for our day\
4:29\
and our time imparted by modern-\
day prophets and apostles.\
4:33\
They entreat us to spend regular,\
4:36\
worshipful time in the\
house of the Lord\
4:38\
and to take to our knees in prayer “to\
access information from heaven.”\
4:43\
Jesus’s promised to those present\
to hear His Sermon on the Mount is\
4:47\
as true for us in our day as it was\
during His earthly ministry:\
4:51\
“Ask and it shall be given you;\
seek and ye shall find;\
4:56\
knock and it shall be opened unto you.”\
4:59\
Our Savior assures that “your\
Father which is in heaven,\
5:02\
give[s] good things to\
them that ask him.”\
5:06\
The Lord’s method of teaching is “line\
upon line, precept upon precept.”\
5:11\
We may be required to “wait\
upon the Lord” in\
5:15\
the space between our current line\
of understanding and the next\
5:18\
yet to be delivered. This\
sacred space can be\
5:22\
a place where our greatest spiritual\
conditioning can occur—\
5:26\
the site where we can “bear with\
patience” our earnest seeking\
5:30\
and renew our strength\
to continue to keep\
5:32\
the sacred promises we've made\
to God through covenant.\
5:36\
Our covenant relationship with Heavenly\
Father and Jesus Christ signals our\
5:41\
prevailing citizenship in God's kingdom,\
5:43\
and our residency therein requires\
aligning our life to divine principles\
5:48\
and putting in the effort\
to grow spiritually.\
5:52\
One key principle taught throughout\
5:54\
the Book of Mormon is when God's\
children choose to demonstrate\
5:57\
obedience and keep their covenants,\
5:59\
they receive continual spiritual\
guidance and direction.\
6:03\
The Lord has told us that\
through our obedience\
6:06\
and diligence we may gain knowledge\
and intelligence.\
6:09\
God's laws and commandments are not\
designed to be an obstacle in our life,\
6:13\
but a powerful gateway to personal\
revelation and spiritual education.\
6:19\
President Nelson has taught\
6:20\
the crucial truth that “revelation from\
God is always compatible with His\
6:24\
eternal law,” and further, that it\
“never contradicts His doctrine.”\
6:28\
Your willing obedience\
to God's commands,\
6:31\
despite not having a complete\
knowledge of His reasons,\
6:35\
places you in the company\
of His prophets.\
6:38\
Moses chapter 5 teaches us about a\
particular interaction between Adam\
6:43\
and an angel of the Lord.\
6:45\
After the Lord gave Adam and Eve\
“commandments, that they should worship\
6:49\
the Lord their God and should offer\
the firstlings of their flocks, for\
6:52\
an offering unto the Lord,”\
6:54\
the scriptures say that “Adam was\
obedient unto the commandments of\
6:58\
the Lord.” We go on to read that\
“after many days an angel of\
7:01\
the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying:\
7:03\
Why dost thou offer sacrifices\
unto the Lord?\
7:06\
And Adam said unto him: I know not, save\
the Lord commanded me.”\
7:12\
Adam's obedience preceded\
his understanding,\
7:16\
and prepared him to receive\
7:17\
the sacred knowledge that he was\
participating in a sacred symbol of\
7:22\
the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\
7:25\
Our humble obedience will\
likewise pave the way\
7:28\
for our spiritual discernments\
of God's ways,\
7:31\
and His divine purpose for each of us.\
7:34\
Reaching to elevate our obedience\
brings us closer to our Savior,\
7:38\
Jesus Christ, because obedience\
to His laws\
7:41\
and commandments is effectually\
reaching out to Him.\
7:44\
Additionally, our fidelity\
to the knowledge\
7:47\
and wisdom we already inherited through\
our faithful adherence to gospel\
7:52\
principles and sacred covenants\
is crucial preparation\
7:55\
for our readiness to receive and be\
stewards of communications from\
7:59\
the Holy Spirit. Heavenly Father\
and Jesus Christ are\
8:03\
the source of all truth and share\
their wisdom liberally.\
8:07\
Also, understanding that we do not\
possess any personal knowledge\
8:11\
independent of God can help\
us to know who to turn to\
8:15\
and where to place our primary trust.\
8:19\
The Old Testament account of Naaman,\
8:21\
the military leader who was healed\
of leprosy by the prophet Elisha,\
8:24\
is a particular favorite of mine.\
8:27\
The story illustrates how the firm\
faith of “a little maid” altered\
8:30\
the course of one man’s life,\
and, for all believers,\
8:34\
revealed the reach of God's mercy to\
those who place their trust in Him\
8:38\
and His prophet. Though nameless,\
8:41\
this young girl also helped to push\
our understanding forward,\
8:45\
and Naaman's belief on her testimony\
inspired him to take his petition\
8:50\
for healing to God's chosen servant.\
8:52\
Naaman's response to the prophet\
Elisha's instructions to wash in\
8:56\
the River Jordan was at first\
skeptical and indignant.\
9:00\
But an invitation for him\
to be obedient to\
9:03\
the prophet's counsel made\
way for his healing\
9:06\
and his dramatic understanding\
that God was real.\
9:11\
We may find that some of our spiritual\
petitions have reasonably discernible\
9:16\
answers and may not create significant\
discomfort for us.\
9:20\
Or, like Naaman, we may find that\
other needs are more challenging\
9:24\
and may create difficult and\
complex feelings within us.\
9:29\
Or similar to the description of\
9:31\
the astronomer’s early conclusions\
about our solar system,\
9:35\
in our search for spiritual truth,\
9:37\
we may reach less accurate\
interpretations if we rely exclusively\
9:42\
on our own limited understanding,\
9:45\
a sorrowful and unintended consequence\
of which may lead us away from\
9:49\
the covenant path. And moreover, some\
questions may persist until God,\
9:56\
who “has all power” and “all wisdom,\
and all understanding,”\
10:01\
who “comprehendeth all\
things” in His mercy,\
10:05\
provides enlightenment through\
our belief on His name.\
10:10\
One significant caution from Naaman's\
account is that resisting obedience\
10:14\
to God's laws and commandments may\
prolong or delay our growth.\
10:20\
We are blessed to have Jesus Christ\
as our Master Healer.\
10:24\
Our obedience to God's laws and\
commandments can open the way\
10:28\
for our Savior to provide\
the understanding\
10:30\
and healing He knows we need,\
10:33\
according to His prescribed treatment\
plan for us. Elder Richard G. Scott\
10:38\
taught that “this life is an\
experience in profound trust—\
10:43\
trust in Jesus Christ, trust\
in His teachings,\
10:46\
trust in our capacity as\
led by the Holy Spirit\
10:49\
to obey those teachings for happiness\
now and for our purposeful,\
10:53\
supremely ... eternal existence.\
10:56\
To trust means to obey willingly,\
10:58\
without knowing the end\
from the beginning.\
11:01\
To produce fruit, your trust in\
the Lord must be more powerful\
11:04\
and enduring than your confidence\
in your own personal feelings\
11:08\
and experience.” Elder Scott continues,\
“To exercise faith is to trust that\
11:13\
the Lord knows what He’s doing with you,\
11:15\
and that He can accomplish\
it for your eternal good,\
11:18\
even though you cannot understand\
how He can possibly do it.”\
11:22\
Dear friends, I testify that our sincere\
gospel questions can provide\
11:27\
Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ with\
opportunities to help us grow.\
11:31\
My personal effort to seek answers from\
the Lord to my own spiritual questions,\
11:36\
past and present, has allowed\
me to use the space between\
11:39\
the lines of my understanding and God’s\
to practice obedience to Him\
11:44\
and fidelity to the spiritual knowledge\
that I currently possess.\
11:48\
I testify that placing your trust in\
Heavenly Father and in His prophets in\
11:52\
whom He has sent, will help\
you to spiritually elevate\
11:55\
and push you forward towards\
God's expanded horizon.\
11:59\
Your vantage will change because\
you will change.\
12:02\
God knows that the higher you are,\
the farther you can see.\
12:06\
Our Savior invites you\
to make that climb.\
12:09\
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
