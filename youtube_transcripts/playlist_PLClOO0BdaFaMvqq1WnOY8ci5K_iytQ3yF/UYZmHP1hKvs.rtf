God is our Father in Heaven.\
0:02\
We are His spirit children, and we\
are created after His image.\
0:07\
Therefore, each of us, as\
a child of God, has\
0:11\
a divine potential to become like Him.\
0:14\
We lived with Him as spirits before\
we came to this earth.\
0:18\
Heavenly Father, as our spirit parent,\
loves us, wants the best for us,\
0:23\
and prepared a plan for us to receive\
His greatest blessings,\
0:26\
which are immortality and eternal life.\
0:30\
According to the plan, we,\
0:32\
as spirit children, would be given\
agency to choose this plan.\
0:36\
By coming to the earth, we would\
leave God's presence,\
0:39\
forget our pre-mortal life, receive\
bodies of flesh and bones,\
0:44\
gain our own experience, and develop\
faith. With our bodies of flesh\
0:49\
and bone as natural man, we would\
succumb to temptation,\
0:53\
become unclean and distant from God,\
0:55\
and not be able to return\
to His holy presence.\
0:59\
Because of our Heavenly Father’s\
infinite love for us,\
1:02\
He sent His Firstborn Son, Jesus Christ,\
1:05\
to be our Savior. Through His\
sacrifice and the Atonement,\
1:09\
Jesus Christ made it possible for\
us to be redeemed from our sins\
1:13\
and be resurrected and\
receive eternal life.\
1:17\
I am extremely grateful for\
these glorious truths—\
1:21\
what we call the Father’s plan of\
salvation, His plan of mercy,\
1:26\
or His great plan of happiness.\
1:28\
Learning these important truths has\
helped me know my true identity\
1:33\
and the great blessings of God—\
1:36\
blessings God has prepared for us\
of exaltation and eternal life.\
1:40\
The prophet Nephi taught\
us the way: “Wherefore, ...\
1:44\
feast upon the words of Christ;\
1:46\
for behold, the words of Christ will\
tell you all things what you should do.”\
1:50\
He added, “If ye...enter in by the way,\
and receive the Holy Ghost,\
1:55\
it will show unto you all things\
what you should do.”\
1:59\
Today I would like to share how\
the words of Christ and\
2:03\
the Holy Ghost helped me find these\
important peace-keeping truths in my\
2:08\
teenage years. Just like Nephi stated\
in the opening verse of\
2:13\
the book 1 Nephi, I was\
also “born of goodly parents.”\
2:17\
I grew up in Nagano, Japan, in a\
home where honesty, diligence,\
2:22\
and humility were strongly encouraged\
and conformity to\
2:26\
the old customs was strictly followed.\
My father was a very religious man.\
2:31\
I watched him praying in\
front of the Shinto\
2:34\
and Buddhist altars every\
morning and every night.\
2:37\
Even though I had no idea who he was\
praying to and what he was praying\
2:43\
for, I believe some sort\
of unseen power\
2:46\
or God would be “mighty to save” or\
help us if we prayed sincerely.\
2:52\
Like other teenagers, I experienced\
many hardships.\
2:56\
I struggled thinking that life was\
unfair and had lots of ups and downs.\
3:01\
I felt lost, not having\
a sense of direction in my life.\
3:07\
Life seemed so fleeting because\
it would end when I died.\
3:11\
Life without knowing the plan\
of salvation was confusing.\
3:15\
Not long after, I started to learn\
English in junior high school,\
3:19\
all the students in our school received\
a copy of the New Testament.\
3:24\
Though we had barely begun\
our study of English,\
3:27\
our teacher told us we should\
study English by reading it.\
3:31\
I opened it and reviewed its contents.\
3:34\
The words in the New Testament were\
extremely difficult for me, and also—\
3:40\
however, the words in Japanese\
were equally difficult.\
3:45\
However, I was drawn to\
a list of questions of\
3:47\
the soul that had been included just\
before the biblical text in\
3:51\
the Gideon Bible—questions about\
feeling lonely, lacking confidence,\
3:56\
being confused, facing life's trials,\
and so on.\
4:00\
Each item on the list was followed by\
a reference to verses and pages in\
4:05\
the New Testament. I was\
especially drawn to\
4:08\
the question “When you are exhausted.”\
4:12\
The reference led me to open Matthew\
chapter 11, verses 28 through 30,\
4:16\
in which Jesus said to His disciples,\
“Come unto me all ye that labour\
4:22\
and are heavy laden, and\
I will give you rest.\
4:25\
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;\
4:29\
for I am meek and lowly in heart, and\
you shall find rest unto your souls.\
4:34\
For my yoke is easy, and\
my burden is light.”\
4:39\
This was the first verse I remember\
reading the words of Jesus Christ.\
4:44\
Though I did not understand\
all the words He said,\
4:47\
His words comforted me, lifted\
my soul, gave me hope.\
4:52\
The more I read His words,\
4:54\
the more I felt like I should\
try the virtue of His words.\
4:58\
I never felt like I felt that day.\
I felt I was loved.\
5:02\
I felt that Jesus Christ\
was someone I knew.\
5:06\
As I continued studying, I felt\
5:08\
as though He was directly\
speaking to me\
5:11\
when He said, “Blessed are they which do\
hunger and thirst after righteousness,\
5:16\
for they shall be filled.”\
5:19\
His words filled my heart,\
5:20\
even though I could not describe\
my feelings well at that time.\
5:24\
Although Jesus Christ lived\
many centuries ago in\
5:27\
a land unfamiliar to me, I thought\
5:30\
I could trust His words\
with all my heart.\
5:32\
I hoped someday in the future I might\
learn more about Jesus Christ.\
5:38\
That someday came only\
a few years later.\
5:41\
I met very dedicated, young\
5:42\
full-time missionaries of The Church of\
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\
5:47\
And as I soon met a small\
group of kind,\
5:50\
joyful Latter-day Saints striving to\
follow Jesus Christ. Despite it taking\
5:55\
me a while to fully trust them,\
5:57\
I came to see in the restored gospel\
what I yearned for when I studied\
6:01\
the New Testament: the words of\
Jesus Christ and the hope\
6:05\
and peace that come from them.\
6:07\
A particularly sacred experience was\
when the missionaries taught me to pray.\
6:13\
I learned that when we address that—\
6:15\
I learned that we should\
address God by name.\
6:17\
When we pray, we should speak from\
our heart, express our gratitude,\
6:22\
and share our hopes and desires.\
6:25\
Once we have said all that we want to\
say, we end our prayer by saying,\
6:29\
“in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.”\
6:32\
We do this because Jesus commanded\
us to pray in His name.\
6:37\
Praying to Heavenly Father\
6:38\
helped me know who He is and\
my relationship with Him,\
6:42\
that I was His beloved spirit son.\
6:44\
I learned that because Heavenly\
Father knows and loves me,\
6:48\
He will speak to me\
personally, uniquely,\
6:51\
and in ways we understand\
through the Holy Ghost.\
6:55\
There was a time when I really could\
not recognize the Holy Ghost.\
6:59\
I misunderstood, thinking that\
all I had to do was follow\
7:03\
the steps of prayer and something\
dramatic would happen.\
7:06\
One day during a lesson\
with the missionaries,\
7:09\
I stepped out of the lesson\
to take a break.\
7:12\
I was still confused about what\
I should do with my life\
7:15\
if the restored gospel of Jesus\
Christ really was true.\
7:19\
As I was about to return to the room\
where the missionaries were waiting,\
7:23\
I heard the voice of one\
of the missionaries.\
7:26\
I heard my name and instead\
of opening the door,\
7:30\
I listened to the voice on the other\
side of the door. I was stunned.\
7:36\
They were simply praying\
to Heavenly Father.\
7:39\
The one saying the prayer was pleading\
to God that He would hear my prayer.\
7:44\
Though his Japanese was not fluent,\
7:47\
hearing his sincere\
prayer softened my heart.\
7:52\
I wondered why they cared\
about me so much.\
7:55\
Then I realized that their prayer\
on my behalf was a reflection of\
7:59\
Heavenly Father and the Savior’s\
love for me. That love gave me hope.\
8:04\
And afterward I did ask God in faith\
and with real intent.\
8:09\
When I did, I felt the joyful and\
peaceful feeling that I was indeed\
8:14\
a child of God, and that I had a\
divine potential and destiny.\
8:17\
The plan of salvation sunk\
deep into my heart.\
8:22\
President Nelson has said,\
8:24\
“The way you think about who you are\
affects every decision you will ever\
8:28\
make.” It’s so true for me.\
8:31\
The decision to follow the Savior Jesus\
Christ by being baptized and receiving\
8:35\
the gift of the Holy Ghost has blessed\
my life more than I ever imagined.\
8:40\
As we enter into the baptismal\
covenant with God,\
8:43\
we promise that we are willing to take\
upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ,\
8:48\
keep the commandments of God,\
8:50\
and serve Him for the remainder\
of our lives.\
8:54\
Our Heavenly Father, in turn,\
8:55\
promises us we can always have\
His Spirit to be with us—\
8:59\
the continued guidance\
of the Holy Ghost.\
9:02\
I invite you to have faith\
in the message\
9:05\
Nephi taught us that the\
words of Christ and\
9:08\
the Holy Ghost will direct you to all\
things what you should do. Everything!\
9:14\
This is an incredible gift from God.\
9:17\
Brothers and sisters, I am grateful\
9:19\
for our Heavenly Father's\
plan of salvation.\
9:22\
And because He loves us, He prepared\
9:25\
a way to return to His presence through\
His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ.\
9:29\
Knowing His incredible plan will\
help us know we are children,\
9:33\
children of God and we\
can become like Him.\
9:37\
I am grateful for this important truth.\
9:39\
I bear you my witness that the\
words of Jesus Christ and\
9:43\
the Holy Ghost will lead us to\
to receive eternal life.\
9:46\
I know these things are true.\
9:48\
In the sacred name of\
Jesus Christ, amen.\
