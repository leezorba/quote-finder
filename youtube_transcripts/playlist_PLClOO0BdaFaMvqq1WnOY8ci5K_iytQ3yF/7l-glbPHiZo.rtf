When I was a child, like those in\
the choir today, as a family\
0:05\
we went on vacation to a beach on the\
coast of my native country, Chile.\
0:10\
I was so excited to spend some days\
enjoying the summer with my family.\
0:15\
I was also thrilled because I thought\
I could finally join in\
0:20\
and do what my two older brothers\
usually did for fun on the water.\
0:25\
One day my brothers went to play where\
the waves were breaking and\
0:30\
I felt big and mature enough\
to follow them.\
0:34\
As I moved towards the area,\
0:37\
I realized the waves were larger than\
they appeared from the shore.\
0:42\
Suddenly, a wave rapidly approached me,\
taking me by surprise.\
0:48\
I felt like the power of nature\
had taken over me,\
0:52\
and I was dragged into the\
depths of the sea.\
0:57\
I couldn't see or feel any reference\
points as I was tossed around,\
1:03\
just as I thought my adventure on the\
earth might be coming to an end,\
1:09\
I felt a hand pulling me\
towards the surface.\
1:13\
Finally I could see the sun\
and catch my breath.\
1:18\
My brother Claudio had seen my\
attempts to act as a grown-up\
1:24\
and went to my rescue. I was\
not far from the shore;\
1:28\
even though the water was shallow,\
1:30\
I was disoriented and I did not realize\
I could have helped myself.\
1:36\
Claudio told me that I needed to\
be careful, and if I wanted,\
1:41\
he could teach me. Despite the\
gallons of water I swallowed,\
1:48\
my pride and desire to be a big boy\
were stronger. And I said, “Sure.”\
1:55\
Claudio told me I needed\
to attack the waves;\
1:58\
I told myself I would surely lose that\
battle against what seemed like\
2:04\
a huge wall of water. As a new big wave\
approached, Claudio quickly said,\
2:11\
“Look at me; this is how you do it.”\
2:14\
Claudio ran toward the incoming wave\
and dove into it before it broke.\
2:21\
I was so impressed with\
his dive that I lost sight of\
2:28\
the next incoming wave. So again,\
2:31\
I was sent to the depths of the sea and\
tossed by the forces of nature.\
2:38\
A few seconds later, a\
hand grasped mine,\
2:42\
and I was again pulled towards\
the surface and air.\
2:48\
The flame of my pride was extinguishing.\
2:52\
This time my brother invited me to dive\
with him. As per his invitation,\
2:59\
I followed him and we dove together.\
3:04\
I felt as if I was conquering the\
most complicated challenge.\
3:09\
Certainly, it was not very easy,\
3:11\
but I did it thanks to the help and\
example shown by my brother.\
3:18\
His hand rescued me twice.\
3:22\
His example showed me how to\
deal with my challenge\
3:27\
and be victorious that day.\
3:31\
President Russell M. Nelson has invited\
us to think celestial,\
3:37\
and I want to follow his advice and\
apply it to my summer story.\
3:43\
If we think celestial, we will\
understand that our lives will face\
3:51\
challenges that seem greater than\
our capacity to overcome them.\
3:57\
During our mortal time, we are subject\
to the attacks of the adversary. Like\
4:04\
the waves that had power over\
me that summer day,\
4:08\
we can feel powerless and want to\
give in to a stronger fate.\
4:13\
Those malicious waves could jostle\
us from side to side,\
4:19\
but do not forget who has power\
over those waves and in fact,\
4:25\
over all things. That is our Savior,\
Jesus Christ.\
4:31\
He has the power to help us out\
of every miserable condition\
4:37\
or adverse situation. Regardless of\
whether we feel close to Him,\
4:43\
He still can reach us where\
we are, as we are.\
4:49\
As we reach out to Him in faith,\
He will always be there.\
4:55\
And in His time, He will be ready\
and willing to grasp our hands\
5:02\
and pull us up to the safe place.\
If we think celestial,\
5:08\
we will recognize Jesus Christ as\
a flawless example of ministry.\
5:14\
There is a pattern for us in\
the scriptures when He\
5:18\
or His disciples reach out to someone\
in need for help, rescue,\
5:24\
or a blessing as they reach\
out with their hands.\
5:27\
As in my story, I knew\
my brother was there.\
5:32\
But being there for me was not enough.\
5:35\
Claudio knew I was in trouble, and he\
went to help lift me from the water.\
5:42\
Occasionally we think that we only need\
to be there for someone in need,\
5:49\
and many times there is more we can do.\
5:53\
Having an eternal perspective can help\
us receive revelation to offer timely\
6:00\
assistance to others in need.\
6:03\
We can rely on the guidance\
and inspiration of\
6:06\
the Holy Ghost to discern what\
kind of help is needed,\
6:10\
whether it is temporal support\
like emotional comfort,\
6:15\
food, aid with daily tasks,\
6:18\
or spiritual guidance to help others\
in their journey to prepare,\
6:23\
make, and honor sacred covenants.\
6:27\
When Peter, the senior apostle, “walked\
on the water to go to Jesus ...\
6:33\
he was afraid; and beginning to sink.”\
Then “he cried, saying, Lord, save me.”\
6:42\
Jesus knew the faith Peter had\
exercised to come unto Him on\
6:49\
the water. He was also aware of Peter’s\
fear. According to the account,\
6:56\
Jesus immediately stretched forth\
His hand and caught him,\
7:03\
saying the following words:\
7:06\
“O thou of little faith, wherefore\
didst thou doubt?”\
7:12\
His words were not to scold Peter, but\
to remind him that He, the Messiah,\
7:20\
was with him and the disciples.\
7:23\
If we think celestial, we will receive\
7:27\
the confirmation in our hearts that\
Jesus Christ is indeed our Rescuer,\
7:35\
our Advocate with the Father,\
and our Redeemer.\
7:40\
As we exercise faith in Him,\
7:43\
He will save us from our fallen state,\
beyond our challenges, infirmities,\
7:49\
and needs in this temporal life and\
give us the greatest of all gifts,\
7:54\
which is eternal life. My brother\
did not give up on me that day,\
8:01\
but persisted so I could learn\
how to do it for myself.\
8:07\
He persisted, even if that required\
rescuing me twice.\
8:14\
He persisted even if I could\
not get it at first.\
8:19\
He persisted so I could overcome\
that challenge and succeed.\
8:26\
If we think celestial, we will realize\
that our Savior will be there\
8:31\
as many times as necessary, to provide\
help if we want to learn, change,\
8:37\
overcome, cope, or succeed in\
whatever will bring true\
8:42\
and everlasting happiness to our lives.\
8:46\
The scriptures immortalize the symbol\
and significance of the Savior's hands.\
8:54\
In his atoning sacrifice,\
8:56\
His hands were pierced by nails\
to fix Him on the cross.\
9:01\
After His resurrection, He appeared to\
His disciples in a perfect body,\
9:06\
but the prints in His hands remained as\
a reminder of His infinite sacrifice.\
9:12\
His hand will always be there for us,\
9:15\
even if we cannot see it\
or feel it at first,\
9:18\
because He was chosen by our Heavenly\
Father to be our Savior,\
9:22\
the Redeemer of all humankind.\
9:26\
If I think celestial, I know that we\
are not left alone in this life.\
9:32\
While we must face challenges\
and trials,\
9:35\
our Heavenly Father knows our\
capabilities and knows we can bear\
9:39\
or overcome our difficulties. We must do\
our part and turn to Him in faith.\
9:45\
His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, is our\
Rescuer and will always be there.\
9:53\
In His name, the sacred\
name of Jesus Christ, amen.\
