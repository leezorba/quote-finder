It is a sacred tribute to the Father and the Son, symbolizing the reaction of the multitude when the Savior made His triumphal entry into Jerusalem. It also reaffirms what young Joseph experienced that day in the Sacred Grove﻿—namely, that the Father and the Son are two glorified Beings, whom we worship and praise.",
