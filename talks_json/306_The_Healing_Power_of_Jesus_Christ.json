As to those who sorrow, Isaiah declared that the Savior possessed the power to ‘comfort all that mourn’ ( Isaiah 61:2 ), and ‘wipe away tears from off all faces’ ( Isaiah 25:8 ; see also Revelation 7:17 ); ‘revive the spirit of the humble’ ( Isaiah 57:15 ); and ‘bind up the brokenhearted’ ( Isaiah 61:1 ; see also Luke 4:18 ; Psalm 147:3 ). So expansive was his succoring power that he could exchange ‘beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness’ ( Isaiah 61:3 ).",
