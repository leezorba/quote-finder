In contrast, he called the servant who hid his unique talent in the earth “unprofitable,” and he took away even that which he had received. 13",

As you stay faithful in this sacred stewardship and honor your eternal covenants, you will grow in the knowledge of God and of His Son, Jesus Christ, and you will feel Their love and Their influence more abundantly in your life. All this will prepare you to dwell with Them and receive additional creative power 14 in the life to come.",
