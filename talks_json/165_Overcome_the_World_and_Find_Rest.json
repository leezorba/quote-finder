We cultivate faith in Jesus Christ by repenting daily and keeping covenants that endow us with power. We stay on the covenant path and are blessed with spiritual strength, personal revelation, increasing faith, and the ministering of angels. Living the doctrine of Christ can produce the most powerful virtuous cycle, creating spiritual momentum in our lives. 10",

What they do produce is nothing but a hollow substitute for “the blessed and happy state of those [who] keep the commandments of God.” 11",

The answer is clear: entering into a covenant relationship with God binds us to Him in a way that makes everything about life easier.

Don’t pollute it with false philosophies of unbelieving men and women.

Each day, record the thoughts that come to you as you pray; then follow through diligently.
