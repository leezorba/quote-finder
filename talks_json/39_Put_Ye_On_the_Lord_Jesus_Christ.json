When Adam and Eve partook of the fruit and had to leave the Garden of Eden, they were given coats of skins as a covering for them.

Kaphar is the basic Hebrew word for atonement, and one of its meanings is “to cover.” Our temple garment reminds us that the Savior and the blessings of His Atonement cover us throughout our lives.
