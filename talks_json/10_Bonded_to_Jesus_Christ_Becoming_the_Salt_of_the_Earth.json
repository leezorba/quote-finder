We can’t be salt on our own; if we are to be salt of the earth, we must be bonded to the Lord, and that is what I see as I mingle with members of the Church around the world—I see faithful members of the Church bonded to the Lord, committed in their efforts to serve others and be the salt of the earth.",

        "paragraph_text": "This ancient method harvests what is called “flower of salt.” To fully appreciate the intricate process of harvesting the flower of salt, it is essential to understand the environment in which it is produced. The Algarve’s coastal salt marshes provide the ideal conditions for salt production. Seawater is channeled into shallow ponds, known as salt pans, where it is left to evaporate under the intense sun. As the water evaporates, the flower of salt forms delicate crystals on the surface of the salt pans. These crystals are incredibly pure and have a unique, crisp texture. The marnotos carefully skim the crystals from the water’s surface using specialized tools, a process that requires great skill and precision. In Portugal, this fine-quality salt is referred to as “salt cream” because it can be gently skimmed away like cream rising to the top of milk. This delicate salt is cherished for its purity and exceptional flavor, making it a prized ingredient in culinary arts.",
