Some of them reside in our own neighborhoods. … Indeed heaven never seems closer than when we see the love of God manifested in the kindness and devotion of people so good and so pure that angelic is the only word that comes to mind” (“ The Ministry of Angels ,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2008, 30).",
