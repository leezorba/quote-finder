Cook, my seatmate in the Quorum of the Twelve for almost 15 years, all readily will attest to the fact that I do not sing well. But in spite of my lack of vocal talent, I love to sing the hymns of the Restoration. The combination of inspired lyrics and majestic melodies helps me to learn essential gospel principles and stirs my soul.",

As we are bound and “hold fast” to the Lord and are transformed by living His doctrine, 24 I promise that individually and collectively we will be blessed to “stand in holy places, and shall not be moved.” 25 If we abide in Christ, then He will abide in and walk with us. 26 Surely, “in the days of trial his Saints he will cheer, and prosper the cause of truth.” 27",
