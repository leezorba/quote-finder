        "paragraph_text": "Throughout His mortal ministry, the Savior showed great compassion for all of God’s children—especially for those who were suffering or had fallen away. When criticized by the Pharisees for associating with and eating among sinners, Jesus responded by teaching three familiar parables. 1 In each of these parables, He emphasized the importance of seeking out those who had strayed and the joy that is felt when they return. For example, in the parable of the lost sheep, He said, “[Great] joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.” 2",

Yet in the very next verse, Lehi continues by explaining that “the Messiah [came to] … redeem [us] from the fall.” 5 Redemption, by and through the Savior Jesus Christ, makes joy possible.",

        "paragraph_text": "I find it helpful to try to imagine the joy the Savior must feel each time we receive the blessings of His atoning sacrifice in our lives. 23 As cited by President Nelson, 24 the Apostle Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews shared this tender insight: “Lay aside every … sin which doth so easily beset us, … looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross … and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.” 25 We speak often of the pain and suffering of Gethsemane and Calvary, but seldom do we speak of the great joy the Savior must have anticipated as He offered His life for us. Clearly, His pain and His suffering were for us, that we might experience the joy of returning with Him to the presence of God.",

        "paragraph_text": "Brothers and sisters, I conclude by sharing my personal witness, which I consider a sacred gift. I testify that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the world. I know that He loves each of us. His singular focus, His “work and [His] glory,” 27 is to help us receive a fulness of joy in Him. I am a personal witness that repenting daily and coming unto Jesus Christ is the way to experience joy—joy beyond our imagination. 28 That is why we are here on earth. That is why God prepared His great plan of happiness for us. Jesus Christ truly is “the way, the truth, and the life” 29 and the only “name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God.” 30 I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",
