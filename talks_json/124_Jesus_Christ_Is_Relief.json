They were innovative in getting him there—uncovering the roof and lowering the man, on his bed, to the place where Jesus was teaching. When Jesus “saw their faith, he said [to the man with palsy], thy sins are forgiven thee.” 1 And then, “Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.” 2 And immediately the man with palsy arose and took his bed and departed for home, “glorifying God.” 3",
