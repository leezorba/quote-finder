Since we have sustained President Nelson as our prophet, he has taught about the principle of power—specifically, God’s power—and how we can access it. He has taught how we can draw upon God’s power as we minister to others, 2 how repentance invites the power of Jesus Christ and His Atonement into our lives, 3 and how priesthood—the power and authority of God—blesses all who make and keep covenants with Him. 4 President Nelson has testified that God’s power flows to all who are endowed in the temple as they keep their covenants. 5",
