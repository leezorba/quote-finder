We lived near the Laie Hawaii Temple when it served much of the Church membership of the Asia Pacific Area, including Japan. 1 At this time, groups of Japanese Saints began coming to Hawaii to receive the blessings of the temple.",

Two decades earlier, she had been married in a traditional arranged Buddhist wedding. Just a few months later, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, thrusting the United States into a conflict with Japan. In the wake of battles such as Midway and Iwo Jima, the tides of war pushed the Japanese forces back to the shores of her island home, Okinawa, the last line of defense standing against the Allied forces before the heartlands of Japan.",
