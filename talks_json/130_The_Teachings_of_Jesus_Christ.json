As the prophet Nephi taught us, we should “feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.” 3 Most of the scriptures reporting Jesus’s mortal ministries are descriptions of what He did . My message today consists of a selection of the words of our Savior—what He said . These are words recorded in the New Testament (including the inspired additions of Joseph Smith) and in the Book of Mormon. Most of these selections are in the sequence in which our Savior spoke them.",
