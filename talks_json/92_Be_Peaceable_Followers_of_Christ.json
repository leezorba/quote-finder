Nelson has said, graduate to the other side of the veil. We have seen some who were raised in faith and belief step off the covenant path.",

They had been driven out of Missouri, and their persecutors had driven them out of Nauvoo in a terrible winter season. The revelation to Brigham gave practical counsel on how to prepare for the exodus.
