Meditate on His words. Take His yoke upon you. Seek to understand and obey.” 2 Elder Wirthlin then promised transformative blessings to those willing to give time and place to Jesus Christ. 3",

Whether as missionaries, ministers, Relief Society presidents, bishops, teachers, parents, siblings, or friends, we are all engaged as Latter-day Saint disciples in the work of bringing others to Christ. Thus, the qualities exhibited by the four friends are worth considering and emulating. 27 They are bold, adaptive, resilient, creative, versatile, hopeful, determined, faithful, optimistic, humble, and enduring.",

        "paragraph_text": "Additionally, the four emphasize the spiritual importance of community and fellowship. 28 In order to bring their friend to Christ, each of the four must carry their corner. If one lets go, things get more difficult. If two give up, the task effectively becomes impossible. Each of us has a role to play in the kingdom of God. 29 As we fill that role and do our part, we carry our corner. Whether in Argentina or Vietnam, Accra or Brisbane, a branch or a ward, a family or a missionary companionship, we each have a corner to carry. As we do, and if we will, the Lord blesses us all. As He saw their faith, so will He see ours and bless us as a people.",
